1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,860
 All right, well, hey, welcome friends in the room

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,480
 to Porch Kickoff 2021.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,320
 And friends,

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,600
 man, this is my 12th kickoff to be a part of,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,480
 and this one feels as sweet.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,600
 You guys look good, man.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
 Maybe it's just 'cause I haven't seen people in a while,

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,880
 but it is so fun to get to be with y'all.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,760
 And everybody joining us online

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,600
 or everyone at different locations,

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,720
 one time a year, we try to rattle off

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,540
 all the different locations just to celebrate

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,200
 how God has worked all around the country

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,080
 at Porch Live locations outside of this city.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
 And so we've got Austin, Texas, I wanna welcome,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,940
 Cincinnati, Houston, Northwest Arkansas,

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,880
 South Hampton, Philadelphia, Tulsa, Boise, Idaho,

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,760
 Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Southwest Minnesota,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
 Indianapolis, Scottsdale, and Fort Worth.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,480
 And Scottsdale and Indianapolis kicking off tonight,

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,880
 Porch locations around the country.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,840
 Hey, let me kick us off and give you a little bit

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,000
 of a glimpse into my time over the break

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,520
 that'll give us some traction for where we're going.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,640
 I have a son who turned five, his name is Crew.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,320
 I think we have a picture of him up here.

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,120
 There he is, first day of school,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,160
 just dimples, cute as can be.

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,400
 And it was back in October, September,

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,440
 whenever school started,

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,560
 but he enrolled in a basketball clinic.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
 What's a basketball clinic?

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,260
 It's where they go,

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,520
 you don't get on a team,

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
 you just learn how to play basketball 'cause you're five.

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,420
 So we showed up, we went to the basketball clinic,

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,260
 I think we have a picture there of him standing,

39
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,240
 there he is on the right,

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
 just standing there with a basketball.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,360
 He's never played basketball before,

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
 doesn't really totally get it, but that's okay.

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
 It's a clinic.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,360
 The whole point is you show up and they teach you

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,960
 how to play basketball, how to dribble the ball,

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
 how to handle things.

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,840
 The coach is standing in that picture,

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,800
 has everybody line up, go back to the first picture,

49
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,840
 has everyone line up, says,

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,920
 hey, first thing we're gonna do,

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,420
 we're gonna work on dribbling.

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,280
 My son has like the greatest fear of failure

53
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,320
 of anyone that I know.

54
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,280
 He gets it from his mom, that's definitely not true,

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,800
 but he immediately picks up the ball

56
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,960
 and the coach is like, hey, we're gonna dribble,

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
 we're just gonna walk down the court, we're gonna dribble.

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,840
 And I just see, and whenever you're five,

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,280
 the tear ducts are like in full display at all times.

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
 So there's tears on call whenever you need them.

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
 And I just see him from across the way

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
 and he begins to like just,

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,720
 like a trembling lip and just freak out

64
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,880
 and the coach says go

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
 and all the other kids start dribbling down.

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,340
 He picks up his ball and just runs over immediately to me,

67
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,220
 bawling, saying, I can't do it, I can't do it.

68
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,140
 And I'm like, this mixture of like emotions

69
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,500
 and come on, son, you're embarrassing me here

70
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,340
 and what am I doing?

71
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,160
 You're five.

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,420
 And I walk over and I get him and I take him back over

73
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
 and I'm like, hey, it's okay, you're gonna learn.

74
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,380
 This is why we're here.

75
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,200
 You're just gonna learn how to dribble.

76
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,040
 It's gonna be okay.

77
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,940
 He's still bawling.

78
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,300
 He doesn't wanna do the dribbling drills.

79
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,140
 That's okay.

80
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,020
 Next drill comes up.

81
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
 It's a passing game.

82
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,260
 Kids get in a circle.

83
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
 I think we had a picture of that.

84
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,380
 All the kids get in a circle

85
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,700
 and he bounce, or the coach passes it.

86
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,080
 The first kid to miss it or fumble has to sit down

87
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,840
 and they go around until there's one person left standing.

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,640
 The way you win is you catch it every single time.

89
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,800
 So they'll go around, I'm watching him.

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,640
 I'm seeing him catch it.

91
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
 I'm like, there you go, slugger.

92
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,560
 And eventually all the kids end up dropping it

93
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,440
 except for him.

94
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 I'm like, dude, this is great.

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
 He's gonna love basketball.

96
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,160
 This is just great memories that he's forming.

97
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
 I look over and the coach says, everybody stand back up.

98
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
 Let's play again.

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,880
 Again, the tear ducts just like explode

100
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,080
 and he picks up his ball and runs back over to me

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
 and the coach is like, he doesn't wanna play.

102
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
 He's like, yeah, I wanna go out on top.

103
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
 I won.

104
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,180
 I don't wanna risk losing it again.

105
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,620
 I'm like, oh my goodness.

106
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,300
 This fear of failing or not succeeding,

107
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,940
 you're gonna have to get over.

108
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,140
 It's really one of the more interesting ways

109
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,140
 that I've seen that fear of people down

110
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,620
 or fear of failing take place in his life.

111
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,820
 It's a fear that he's gonna battle for the rest of his life.

112
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,180
 You see, I was joking earlier saying he gets from mom.

113
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,500
 If anything, he gets it from his dad

114
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,620
 and I'll explain more what I mean in a second.

115
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,620
 But all of that idea is, is I'm afraid to fail.

116
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,240
 I'm afraid to not be successful.

117
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,880
 I'm afraid to let other people's expectations down

118
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,580
 or my own expectations down.

119
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,700
 And that's a fear that I think most of us

120
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,820
 from an early age have battled.

121
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,380
 You came into the room tonight and a lot of people,

122
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,740
 they never get over this battle.

123
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,520
 They live their entire life with the fear

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,140
 of letting people's expectations down

125
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,780
 or only okay if they feel like they're succeeding

126
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,340
 and doing okay and exceeding the expectations

127
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,320
 of themselves or of other people.

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,640
 And that idea is directly connected

129
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,240
 to what I wanna talk about tonight, which is identity.

130
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,620
 Because people will go their entire life

131
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,700
 and they'll ride the rollercoaster of emotions

132
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
 based on finding their identity,

133
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,620
 which is like who I am, how I see myself,

134
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,060
 how I think about myself, how I handle the world.

135
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,900
 That's identity.

136
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,220
 And they are okay with their identity

137
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,420
 or okay with themselves if they feel like

138
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,740
 they're doing well and things are going good

139
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,540
 or they're approved by the people around them

140
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,020
 and things are not going well when they feel like

141
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,260
 I'm letting people down or what do they think about me.

142
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,780
 I was talking to a counselor friend and he said,

143
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,540
 most people, when it comes to identity,

144
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,540
 it involves something like this.

145
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,820
 It's identity equals performance over expectations cubed.

146
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,620
 In other words, people will find their identity

147
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,320
 and they're okay with themselves if their performance,

148
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,420
 how they're doing, how they're doing at work,

149
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,580
 how they're doing as a friend, how they're doing with God,

150
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,940
 exceeds or is bigger than expectations.

151
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,660
 Why I said cubed is it, in his words,

152
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,300
 typically involves the expectations of themself

153
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,860
 they have for themself, of others,

154
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,020
 they're exceeding what other people want them to do,

155
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,840
 they're doing well.

156
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,420
 If they're like, man, people are really disappointed in me,

157
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,980
 then they're not doing well.

158
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,480
 And then the third one is the expectations they think

159
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,220
 other people have of them,

160
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,400
 whether or not they're even communicated.

161
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,520
 This is the type of person who's like,

162
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,100
 oh man, he said I did a good job,

163
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,440
 but he really doesn't think I'm doing a good job.

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,280
 He doesn't think I'm good at all.

165
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,560
 He thinks I'm terrible.

166
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,920
 That would be the person who's struggling with,

167
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,620
 am I meeting the expectations I think they have for me?

168
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,360
 And as I was talking with him and just sharing

169
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,400
 kind of in my own life and my own battle and journey

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,640
 with identity problems, he said,

171
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,520
 this is the challenge most people walk through

172
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
 and they find themselves okay

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,200
 if they feel like they're doing good in life.

174
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,120
 They find themselves not okay

175
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,720
 if they're not doing well in life.

176
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,480
 And they judge doing well and not doing well

177
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,860
 based on the expectations of other people around them.

178
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,480
 By other people, I mean your boss, your friends,

179
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,280
 that little thing that goes off inside of you

180
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,560
 when you say something at work and they're like,

181
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,960
 oh my gosh, I can't believe I just said that.

182
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,200
 What is everybody thinking about me?

183
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,040
 That's connected to identity.

184
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,280
 Your inability to move on

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,760
 or your anxiousness that you feel.

186
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,200
 I mean, think about the ways that we can obsess

187
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
 over what strangers think about you.

188
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880
 Maybe it's just me.

189
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,040
 I had a staycation with my wife this past week

190
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
 and went into a hotel and I'll interact with strangers

191
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,960
 and I'll walk away being like,

192
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
 I wonder what he thought about that interaction.

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
 And I'm thinking about someone I've never met before,

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,720
 I'll probably never see again for the rest of my life.

195
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,000
 And it can come down to finding your identity

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,920
 and approval on what other people think

197
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,540
 or even what you think.

198
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,520
 Is it possible to actually live a life

199
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,520
 where you operate not out of an insecurity,

200
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,800
 not out of a fear or not out of a rollercoaster

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
 of like I'm doing well today

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,760
 'cause I feel like everyone's happy with me

203
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
 or I'm not doing well today

204
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
 'cause I feel like I'm letting everyone down

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,760
 or I'm not doing well

206
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,160
 because I'm supposed to be married by now.

207
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
 I'm not in the job that I wanna be in right now.

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,240
 I lost my career in COVID.

209
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,000
 Everyone probably thinks I'm a failure.

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,480
 Is it possible to not be owned by those things?

211
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,580
 In other words, to be so secure in your identity

212
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,100
 that no matter what happens around you,

213
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,160
 you're at peace.

214
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,400
 And tonight I wanna talk about what the Bible says

215
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,680
 are three ingredients for you and I to experience that.

216
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,000
 So we're gonna talk about Christian identity

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
 if you take notes.

218
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
 And I'm gonna walk through three things that are involved

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
 for you and I to break through

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
 and experience a life that finds our identity

221
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,740
 'cause as Christians, we're promised and told

222
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,320
 there's a way to experience a peace,

223
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,240
 not the rollercoaster, not the waves of insecurity.

224
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
 And it happens by finding your identity

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,040
 and who God says that you are.

226
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,240
 So I wanna walk through really three simple things

227
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,080
 that you're gonna feel like, you may even think,

228
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,100
 oh, I've heard that before.

229
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,160
 My guess is at some part in all of our hearts,

230
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
 you don't really believe it.

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,300
 And the more that you and I do,

232
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,320
 the more that we're gripped by what God says,

233
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,560
 the more you will experience freedom as it relates

234
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,360
 to not needing the approval of people.

235
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,960
 So the first one, the first one has to do with worth.

236
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,200
 If I was to say like, hey, where does your worth come from?

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,280
 I wanna talk about what the Bible says

238
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,480
 is directly connected to what makes you worthy.

239
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,560
 What is incredibly value about your life?

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,280
 So the first idea is just like your value in Christ.

241
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,440
 I wanna talk about how extraordinarily valuable

242
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,320
 you as a human being are.

243
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,560
 If you were to think about it and answer the question,

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,680
 like what makes me a worthy person or valuable?

245
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,640
 Or is my life as valuable as the next person?

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,000
 Or is the president of the United States

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,160
 more valuable than my life?

248
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,840
 Or is the so-and-so person more valuable than me?

249
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,700
 And what would make me a person?

250
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,500
 It's really incredibly valuable.

251
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,680
 The Bible answers this question.

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,520
 It does so in two ways.

253
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
 It does one in a way for all people everywhere.

254
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,080
 And it says the reason why you have such extraordinary value

255
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
 no matter if you're addicted to pornography right now,

256
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,640
 if you're listening in rehab, if you're in jail,

257
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,400
 or if you came in and everything feels great,

258
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,680
 you have the same fixed eternal value.

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,120
 You can never change it, you can't lose it

260
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,560
 because it all centers around you being made

261
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,040
 in the image of God.

262
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,220
 No matter your biological sex, color of your skin,

263
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,880
 your age, how much money is in your bank account,

264
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,520
 you have a fixed extraordinary value, God would say.

265
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,440
 Because unlike anything else in the creation,

266
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
 you've been made in the image of God.

267
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,400
 He says this in Genesis chapter one, verse 27 and 28.

268
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 God says, "Let us make mankind in our image

269
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,380
 "He made the sun and the moon and the stars,

270
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,880
 "He made all the creation, He made the oceans,

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
 "He made everything and then He came to you and me."

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,780
 He says, "Different from everything else,

273
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,300
 "this is going to be made in my image."

274
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,720
 What does it mean to be made in my image?

275
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,760
 My children are made in my image.

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,680
 You can see the resemblance

277
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,980
 of their mother and father on them.

278
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,540
 You are made in the image of your parents.

279
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,800
 You may look back and be like, no, can't see it in there.

280
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,880
 But there is a way in which there is a resemblance

281
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
 because you have been made in the image of them.

282
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,400
 In the same way, God says, "Hey, all humanity,

283
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,920
 "unlike anything else is so extraordinarily valuable

284
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,660
 "'cause when I came to create everything,

285
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,260
 "it wasn't the sun and the moon and the stars

286
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,040
 "and the planets, all that stuff's cool,

287
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,600
 "not made in the image of God."

288
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,760
 It wasn't the animal kingdom,

289
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,600
 the craziest aquarium, animals or water.

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,080
 I don't know what the word is for things

291
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
 that are in the ocean, fish, there you go.

292
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,480
 It wasn't that, that was made in the image of God.

293
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,760
 Feels like an easy one.

294
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,100
 It was you.

295
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,660
 And he would say, "You are of such extraordinary value

296
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,420
 "because he made you in his image."

297
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,640
 He said, "Let us make them so they rule over the fish

298
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,940
 "and the sea and the birds of the sky,

299
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,380
 "over the livestock, they're distinct above everything else."

300
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,220
 So God created them in his image, male and female,

301
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,180
 both made in the image of God.

302
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,780
 Moses was the person who delivered this message.

303
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,620
 I don't know if you know this,

304
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,660
 Moses wrote the book of Genesis,

305
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,900
 God inspired him, had him write this.

306
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,100
 You know the audience that he told this verse to?

307
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
 It's a group of people called the Israelites.

308
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,420
 Israelites have been enslaved for 400 years.

309
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,260
 That's longer than America has been around.

310
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,300
 All they'd ever known was slaves,

311
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,980
 all their grandparents and grandparents and grandparents

312
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,140
 had ever been slaves and they're set free

313
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,420
 and God takes them out of slavery in Egypt

314
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,580
 and leads them out.

315
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,060
 One of the first things that God says,

316
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,380
 "Moses, I want you to tell them,"

317
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,220
 'cause they may think, "Man, we're not that important

318
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,840
 "and we're not that valuable, we were slaves

319
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,040
 "and all the support or all the important Pharaoh

320
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,380
 "and all of his people, those are the really

321
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,320
 "important people," and he says,

322
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,820
 "No, you were made in the image of God.

323
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,820
 "Your value doesn't change no matter if your behavior does,

324
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,460
 "your circumstances do, and your life

325
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,720
 "is so extraordinarily valuable."

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,460
 My son is, like I said, five,

327
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,100
 so one of the things that we're trying to teach him

328
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,620
 is how to do chores and if you do chores, you get paid.

329
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,660
 And it's pretty awesome actually as a parent

330
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,440
 'cause you're like, "Oh yeah, here, do this for a penny

331
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,380
 "and it'll take you two hours, but go get 'em, son."

332
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,460
 And he doesn't know, he can't use it on anything.

333
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,800
 He's like, "All right, cool, look at how shiny

334
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,700
 "this thing is."

335
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,860
 But anyways, as I'm talking with him,

336
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,700
 one thing I'd never thought of before was

337
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,020
 how do you explain the value of certain coins?

338
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,060
 Because he'll be like, "Oh, this is a penny,"

339
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,280
 and then I'll pull up a nickel and he's like,

340
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,120
 "Oh, what's this?"

341
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,300
 And I'm like, "That's worth five cents."

342
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
 "Oh, what's a cent?"

343
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,540
 And I'm like, "Well, it's like a penny."

344
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,760
 "Well, why don't you say it's worth five penny?"

345
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,360
 "Well, let's not even get there."

346
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,420
 And then he'll go, "What's the dime?"

347
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,020
 "We'll walk through and how to explain

348
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,500
 "or how to understand the value of something."

349
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,540
 And do you know what all centers on?

350
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,380
 It's very simple.

351
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,860
 Whose image is on the coin?

352
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,780
 In other words, he's got coins like just that we have

353
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,860
 laying around the house from being in international trips

354
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,900
 to different places that are either from Mexico

355
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,000
 or places in Europe or places around that.

356
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
 There's a copper coin, but no, no, no,

357
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,420
 there's no Lincoln on there.

358
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,260
 The way that you know that, hey, it's worth a penny

359
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,340
 is whose image is on that.

360
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,220
 The way that you know this is worth five cents

361
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,460
 is Thomas Jefferson's on there.

362
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,940
 Whose image shows you the value of it?

363
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,540
 Like this penny is really interesting.

364
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,780
 We brought a lot of pennies this week

365
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,020
 and I'll explain why here in a second

366
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,380
 and some of the locations will know.

367
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,280
 Thousands of them.

368
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,460
 You know what they don't have in common?

369
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,540
 Some of them are one year old,

370
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
 some of them are 10 years old,

371
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
 some of them have been like in New York,

372
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,980
 they were in a subway, they were thrown away.

373
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,140
 Lord knows where some of these things have been.

374
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,060
 Some of them are dirty, some of them are clean,

375
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,980
 but you know what they all have in common?

376
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,960
 No matter where they've been, no matter how they look,

377
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,320
 they have the same worth, a penny,

378
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,800
 because whose image is on them.

379
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,860
 When the Bible talks about you,

380
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
 and you gotta listen to me,

381
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,340
 when it talks about your worth,

382
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,980
 just like that penny, no matter where it's been

383
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,180
 or what it's done or how clean it looks

384
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,500
 or how clean it feels or how dirty it seems,

385
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,220
 its value never changes.

386
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,340
 Same is true of you, no matter your story,

387
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,740
 no matter if you've been running from God,

388
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,280
 if you would say you're not even a Christian,

389
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,620
 if you feel so much shame and guilt

390
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,700
 from a decision in your past,

391
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,900
 you've never told anybody about,

392
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,880
 you know what doesn't change?

393
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,800
 No matter where you've been, what you've done,

394
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,580
 your worth, because of whose image is on you,

395
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,780
 which is the image of God.

396
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
 There's not a life, if you're listening,

397
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,940
 and somebody needs to hear this,

398
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,260
 where you feel like your life is not worth living,

399
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,900
 you have bought a lie, because of whose image is on you.

400
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,780
 Your value is so extraordinarily high,

401
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,580
 I could not put it into sentences.

402
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,740
 And the second reason you have such extraordinary value

403
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,860
 is because your life, despite all the imperfections

404
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,260
 and all the things messed up in my life and my past,

405
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,900
 was so valuable to God, who loved you and I so much,

406
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,620
 that he would say, I'm willing to even give

407
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,460
 my own son's life for you.

408
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,660
 We think of that, it's not like generic,

409
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,020
 like yeah, he kind of gave it for all of us.

410
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,300
 No, he gave it for you.

411
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,420
 He died in your place.

412
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,820
 In Economics 101, if you remember,

413
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,120
 back in like eighth grade or whenever you took econ,

414
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,840
 they would tell you that the price of a thing,

415
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,300
 the value of a thing is determined

416
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,540
 by the price it will bring.

417
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,140
 In other words, how do you know how valuable something is?

418
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,740
 If I was like, oh yeah, this thing is worth $10 million.

419
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,220
 It would only be worth $10 million

420
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,420
 if somebody said, I'll pay that.

421
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,000
 That's how you know how much it's actually worth.

422
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
 Whatever someone's willing to pay,

423
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,660
 shows you what it's worth.

424
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,800
 When it came to you and it came to me,

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,540
 how extraordinarily valuable are you

426
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,180
 that God would say, here's what I'm willing to pay,

427
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,060
 my own eternal life.

428
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,980
 And for you to experience freedom from identity,

429
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,740
 you got to know you are so valuable to God.

430
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,220
 And your worth has nothing to do with your past,

431
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,300
 your family, your story.

432
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,540
 It's because you've been made in the image of God.

433
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,880
 And whatever that past and story was,

434
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,480
 God loves you so much, he would die for you.

435
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,200
 And that doesn't change if you lose your job.

436
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,320
 That doesn't change if you break up.

437
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,340
 That doesn't change if you had an abortion.

438
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,240
 That doesn't change if you have same sex attraction.

439
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,240
 Because your worth doesn't depend on those things.

440
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,220
 You're made in the image of God.

441
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,400
 Second thing, if you're gonna experience freedom

442
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,520
 from identity, or part of embracing the true identity

443
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,280
 that can bring freedom from like, man, I'm okay

444
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,080
 with what other people think about me,

445
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,960
 is understanding that you, if you are a Christian,

446
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,520
 have been accepted in Christ.

447
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,640
 Then when it came to you and it came to the question,

448
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,680
 I'm like, am I okay, am I enough, am I good enough?

449
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,080
 God has already definitively said, yes.

450
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,800
 When you put your faith in Jesus,

451
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
 everything he did on the cross, it applied to you.

452
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,940
 And he has said, you are enough.

453
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,440
 You are accepted.

454
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,760
 You are accepted by God.

455
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,380
 You are accepted by the one whose opinion matters more

456
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,100
 than any other opinion.

457
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,320
 He says this in Romans chapter eight, starting in verse one.

458
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,940
 There is therefore now no condemnation.

459
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,640
 That means no question marks, that means no,

460
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
 I'm not really sure, that means no,

461
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,500
 maybe they didn't make it.

462
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,080
 None of that, for those who are in Christ.

463
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,680
 Because through Jesus Christ, the law of the spirit

464
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,260
 who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.

465
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,420
 Basically all that means is that Jesus on the cross

466
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,120
 accomplished, hey, there's nothing held against you.

467
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,720
 You're enough, you're accepted.

468
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,640
 You've always been loved, but when you came to faith

469
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,860
 in Christ, you're now accepted and adopted in his family.

470
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,880
 For what the law, or what behavior in doing good things

471
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,800
 was powerless to do because it was weakened

472
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,380
 by our sin nature of the flesh, God did.

473
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,580
 By sinning his own son so that the requirement

474
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,960
 of the law would be fully met in us.

475
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,880
 That Christ answers the question, I am accepted.

476
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,240
 You are accepted in Christ, not because of the things

477
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
 that you've done or haven't done, or your behavior,

478
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 or you deserve it, because he loved you so much

479
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
 that when you put your faith in Jesus,

480
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
 I'm not trusting in how good of a person I am,

481
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,120
 I'm trusting solely in what you did on the cross,

482
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,520
 dying in my place, rising from the grave,

483
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,720
 you paid for my sin.

484
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,960
 When that happens, God says, accepted.

485
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,720
 You have been welcomed and accepted and invited

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
 into a relationship and nothing can break that relationship

487
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,360
 and nothing you do can get you out of it.

488
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,680
 And you've been accepted by the one who matters most.

489
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,960
 How can that happen?

490
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,760
 I was getting a golf lesson this past weekend,

491
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
 I'm terrible at golf, my father-in-law gave me

492
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,600
 golf clubs for Christmas.

493
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,440
 Along with that, he was like,

494
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
 I'm also gonna get you a golf lesson.

495
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,560
 Go to the golf lesson, golf instructor,

496
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,520
 never been here before, walk up to the guy,

497
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,500
 and I'm bad at golf.

498
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,880
 I go to the guy and he's like, I understand you,

499
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,840
 trying to learn golf, and I'm like,

500
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,580
 that may be an understatement, like I am terrible at golf

501
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,980
 and so I don't have anything to bring to the table,

502
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,220
 you just tell me what to do and I'll do that

503
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,340
 and I'm not at all good, so you help me,

504
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,380
 I have nothing to bring you.

505
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,260
 And he looked at me and he said,

506
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,860
 you're my favorite type of person to work with.

507
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,700
 'Cause you're not gonna come in here

508
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,860
 and have all these forms and be like,

509
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,780
 yeah, you did it that way, but I like to do it like this.

510
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,060
 You're just gonna go, hey, I'll do whatever

511
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,180
 you want me to do.

512
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,780
 My favorite person to work with.

513
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,000
 It seems to be when you read the scriptures,

514
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,640
 God's favorite person to work with is the person who says,

515
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,360
 look, I don't deserve a relationship with you,

516
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,080
 I don't deserve to spend eternity with you,

517
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,760
 I've done things in my past that I know were wrong,

518
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
 I feel shame and guilt for those things,

519
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
 God will do whatever you need me to do,

520
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,460
 I bring nothing to the table.

521
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,940
 I need a savior.

522
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,200
 The scriptures say, that's his favorite person to work with,

523
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
 that is the only person he will work with.

524
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,060
 So you're invited and you've been accepted by God,

525
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,320
 which answers the question,

526
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,120
 do I need to look for acceptance anywhere else?

527
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,760
 And the truth is, if that's true,

528
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
 like if I really have been,

529
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,720
 I have the approval of the only one who matters.

530
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,200
 It doesn't matter what you think about me,

531
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,040
 what you think about me, what you think about me,

532
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,440
 what you think about me, what you think about me,

533
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,560
 because I know what he thinks about me.

534
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,080
 And I can walk and rest in that.

535
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,380
 And part of experiencing a freedom in your identity,

536
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,360
 not being consumed by your expectations or others on you,

537
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,860
 is knowing, man, I've been accepted, I have a peace,

538
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,320
 'cause I've been accepted, I'm okay.

539
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,660
 It's crazy how no matter how successful you are in life,

540
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,860
 you wonder the question, like, am I enough?

541
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,020
 Am I okay?

542
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,820
 Like, am I worthy of being accepted

543
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,200
 or worthy of being loved?

544
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,060
 The reason I say no matter how successful

545
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,980
 and how high you climb,

546
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,180
 this question seems to still be asked is,

547
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,140
 you'll see evidence and people incredibly high in society

548
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,980
 and successful celebrities and politicians

549
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,100
 and people who just arrived

550
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,760
 and they still have that insecurity of, am I okay?

551
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,220
 Do you think they accept me?

552
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,300
 There was a story, Oprah Winfrey,

553
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,920
 she gave her commencement speech at Harvard.

554
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,940
 She said something really interesting about this idea

555
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,620
 of how no matter how successful you are,

556
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,540
 you still have that, like, am I okay question,

557
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,520
 unless you find it in Christ.

558
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,580
 She said this in her Harvard speech.

559
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,480
 "I've done over 35,000 interviews in my 27-year career.

560
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,060
 "As soon as the camera shuts off,"

561
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,300
 and I'm in that interview, "everyone," this is so crazy,

562
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,380
 "everyone turns to me and inevitably,

563
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,700
 "inevitably, in their own way, asks this question,

564
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,460
 "was that okay?

565
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
 "I heard it from President Bush,

566
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,440
 "from President Barack Obama.

567
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,200
 "I've heard it from heroes and from housewives.

568
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
 "I've heard it from victims and perpetrators of crimes.

569
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,480
 "I've even heard it from Beyonce, in all her Beyonce-ness.

570
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,400
 "They all wanna know one thing, is that okay?

571
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,440
 "Am I okay?"

572
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,880
 It's a question that unless you find the answer in Christ,

573
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,320
 you're never gonna have the answer that satisfies.

574
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,560
 It's a question that people will spend their entire life

575
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,680
 trying to compensate, try to make more money,

576
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,840
 try to be more successful,

577
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,560
 try to prove my worth to other people.

578
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
 Not knowing the answer to this question

579
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,640
 is why some of you guys have lowered your standards

580
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,540
 so low in dating.

581
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,120
 And you'll end up in relationships

582
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,360
 with people that are so toxic

583
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
 'cause you don't have any standards

584
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
 because you don't think yourself

585
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
 as someone who's of incredible value,

586
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,200
 who's been accepted by the one who matters most.

587
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,560
 Of course you're gonna tolerate it.

588
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,800
 This question, I mean, think about back in high school.

589
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,000
 I don't know if you guys have talked to high schoolers

590
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
 recently or been around in high schools.

591
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 When I first started ministry,

592
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
 I worked in high school ministry.

593
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,560
 I don't know that there is more of an insecure time in life

594
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,060
 than middle school and high school.

595
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,920
 You're walking around, you got pimples on your face,

596
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,120
 you got braces in your teeth,

597
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,760
 you're just like trying to prove everything,

598
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,360
 and you're going through puberty

599
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,200
 and you don't have armpit hair

600
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
 or you have too much armpit hair,

601
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,860
 or you're just like so much insecurity.

602
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,660
 And especially now, if you interact with kids in high school,

603
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,440
 you can see it and you wanna go back

604
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
 and talk to yourself in high school

605
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
 or talk to high schoolers now and be like,

606
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,960
 "Look, hey, I know you're freaking out

607
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,920
 about what did Chelsea say,

608
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 and she did this TikTok video.

609
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,040
 Now everyone at school thinks that you're like,

610
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,720
 I know you're freaking out right now.

611
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
 And you're like, oh, I should just die,

612
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,580
 lock me in my room."

613
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,880
 In a very short amount of time,

614
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 I mean like two years, maybe less,

615
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,440
 all of those opinions that you are panicked about

616
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,100
 and sick to your stomach about and freaking out about,

617
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,100
 and all of those people, they won't even be in your life.

618
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,940
 Hit the pressure release valve.

619
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,700
 But they're in that moment, they just can't let it go.

620
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,060
 And like, "Oh my gosh, it's the biggest deal in the world.

621
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,980
 I can't believe this happened.

622
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,780
 And she's gonna go with her to homecoming

623
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,860
 and my whole life is ruined.

624
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,900
 We have the same color dress and I'm freaking out."

625
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,140
 And you're like, "Oh man, it's gonna be okay."

626
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,840
 Right?

627
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,640
 So much of our life is spent in that same way.

628
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,680
 You just can't see it in the moment.

629
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,480
 It's easy to see when you look back.

630
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,080
 There's gonna be coworkers, there's people in your life,

631
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,560
 there's relationships you have right now.

632
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:52,200
 And in five years, three years, 10 years,

633
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,240
 they won't be the ones

634
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,680
 that are still consistently around you.

635
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,400
 How long are you gonna find your identity

636
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,480
 in what they think about you?

637
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,880
 How long are you gonna search for acceptance

638
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 in what they think about you

639
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,580
 and whether or not you're meeting their expectations

640
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,420
 or you think you're meeting their expectations?

641
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,780
 And the answer to that question is however long that is,

642
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,700
 is the same amount of time you're gonna keep riding

643
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
 the roller coaster and the wave.

644
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,360
 And there is another way.

645
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,380
 Say, "Man, I'm accepted because of what Christ has done,

646
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,700
 who he is in my life."

647
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,860
 Galatians chapter one, verse 10 says, Paul writing,

648
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,860
 "Am I trying to win the approval of humans or of God?"

649
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,100
 And then he gives the answer.

650
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,620
 "If I was trying to please people,

651
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,260
 I could not be a servant of Christ."

652
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,680
 And it's embracing, I've been accepted by God

653
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,160
 whose opinion matters most of me, of you,

654
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,660
 not a future version of you,

655
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,220
 not someday when you stop sinning,

656
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,440
 not someday when you get more Bible verses memorized,

657
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,500
 not someday when you get it all together.

658
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,780
 Now, he loves you.

659
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,960
 And you don't have to seek and search

660
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,260
 and try to earn that from him.

661
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,620
 You have it if you put your faith in Jesus.

662
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,960
 And now you can walk knowing I have been accepted.

663
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,700
 And no matter what I do for the rest of my life

664
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,000
 or what I don't do or what I don't accomplish,

665
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,060
 the one whose opinion matters most has been clear.

666
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,520
 I am approved and accepted.

667
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,500
 Finally, third thing related to experience of freedom

668
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,380
 and an identity level is having a death grip

669
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,780
 on your worth, how valuable you are in Christ,

670
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,340
 how you've been accepted in Christ,

671
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,020
 and how through him, you and I can be complete in Christ.

672
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,980
 We can live and operate out of a fullness,

673
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,380
 not of a need for people to fill something else,

674
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,060
 not of a need for a job to bring us

675
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,700
 some sort of validation that we matter in life,

676
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,780
 not of a need for a relationship or being married

677
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,000
 or having kids to fill some hole in us

678
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,140
 because the only one who can fill that hole

679
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,060
 is Jesus and in Christ and through walking with him

680
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,300
 in relationship, I can experience being filled from there.

681
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,220
 He says this in Colossians chapter two, verses eight

682
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,060
 through 10, "For in Christ, the fullness of deity,"

683
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,900
 that's God, "lives in bodily form, fully God in Jesus.

684
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,620
 "And in Christ, you have been brought to fullness."

685
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,620
 Jesus, fully God in human form, and that fullness

686
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,900
 through God in Jesus has now been brought about in you.

687
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
 The same word for fullness is complete.

688
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,660
 That you need to know that in Christ, you are offered

689
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,500
 that thing, that itch, the hole that sometimes

690
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,660
 can go looking for something, you just gotta fill this.

691
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,780
 It's not gonna be found anywhere else

692
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,980
 because you can be complete in Christ or only in Christ

693
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,820
 can you be complete, which is the third point for tonight.

694
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,220
 Your true identity and an identity

695
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,820
 that will actually bring freedom,

696
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,740
 will never come from what you achieve,

697
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,500
 but what you receive in Jesus.

698
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,660
 That you will never experience it or any true identity

699
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,420
 or any actual identity that brings about peace

700
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,340
 and like, man, I'm okay, will never come

701
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,300
 from something you achieve.

702
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,580
 It only comes from receiving in Christ.

703
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,540
 It's not dissimilar to this.

704
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,300
 A lot of us, when it comes to our identity,

705
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,460
 we think of it as things that kind of make ourselves up.

706
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,940
 So some of it's good, some of it's bad,

707
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,260
 but I would say, if I asked you, sat down and said,

708
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,060
 tell me who you are, you may walk through

709
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,140
 and so deeply connected in how you see yourself

710
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,260
 and I said, really, like explain,

711
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,500
 like tell me, describe yourself.

712
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,460
 And you go like, some of it would be related

713
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,780
 to your skin color, man, I'm white

714
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,620
 or I have darker, beautiful brown complexion.

715
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,940
 I'm Hispanic in my heritage, I have blue eyes,

716
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,580
 I have yellow hair, I have red hair,

717
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,500
 I have, you would describe yourself.

718
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,820
 So there's physical characteristics.

719
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,980
 Then you would tell us your age

720
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,140
 and you would begin to comprise that

721
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,980
 and then I'd say, what do you do?

722
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,260
 And you'd be like, well, here's what job that I do.

723
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,460
 I'm an accountant or I work for Deloitte in consulting

724
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,060
 or you would begin to fill in the blank

725
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,100
 and what education?

726
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,060
 Well, I'm a Baylor grad or I'm an Aggie grad

727
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,140
 or I'm an No grad.

728
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,500
 You'd say, I'm self-made, I'm an entrepreneur

729
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,300
 and you'd walk through, I'm a TikTok influencer, wannabe.

730
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,100
 And you would begin to explain like, here's who they are

731
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,460
 and you, without knowing it, most of us

732
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,700
 would begin to fill up like, this is who I am

733
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,740
 and I find my identity, some of it in good things,

734
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
 some of it in bad things.

735
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,180
 Man, I'm a loser, I'm athletic, I'm not athletic.

736
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,940
 I'm smart, I'm not smart.

737
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,220
 A lot of times the things that we find identity in,

738
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,300
 they can become idols inside of our life

739
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,940
 and they fill up in the way that we see ourself.

740
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,620
 That was you, with a cylinder being you

741
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,140
 and there's these things that comprise our identity.

742
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,500
 Christ wants us to operate in a way

743
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,260
 where when it comes to my identity,

744
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,540
 those things are maybe a part of my life

745
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
 but they're not my truest and deepest

746
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,820
 and most meaningful sense of my identity

747
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,020
 because those things are just on the surface.

748
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,300
 Who I am comes from something so much deeper.

749
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,780
 I'm someone who's made in the image of God.

750
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,940
 I'm a child of God.

751
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,620
 I'm someone who's forgiven.

752
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,420
 Someone who has a abiding relationship with Christ.

753
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,220
 And the more that you and I can live from a place

754
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,620
 where I'm operating out of a fullness in my life

755
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,060
 that I'm being filled up or I have been filled up

756
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,300
 and I'm marked not by all the things

757
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,540
 that the world looks on and says,

758
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,220
 man, this is what your identity is found in

759
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,500
 or this is really who you are

760
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,700
 and this makes you important

761
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,980
 or this makes you successful.

762
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,900
 The more that I'm full and completed

763
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,620
 and operating out of a real confidence

764
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,900
 relationship with God.

765
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,740
 The more of those things, it's not that they disappear,

766
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,860
 just don't define me.

767
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,420
 They're just on the surface

768
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,220
 because I'm filled with Jesus.

769
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,660
 And there'll be things that I'm tempted

770
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,340
 and they come along and I'm afraid,

771
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,300
 like what if we end up breaking up

772
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,180
 or what if I lose my job

773
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,860
 and I'm pushing them in here.

774
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,580
 The more that I'm filled with the spirit of Christ

775
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,380
 and I'm walking with Jesus and I'm spending time with him

776
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,180
 and allowing his spirit to remind me of who I am,

777
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,820
 the more I see that these things are just on the surface.

778
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,380
 Just don't define me.

779
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,460
 Which means if they come and go,

780
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,700
 it doesn't change who I am.

781
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,800
 You may never be a mom.

782
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,740
 That doesn't mean you're not of extraordinary value

783
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,100
 and you're not accepted by God.

784
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,220
 You may never make over $100,000.

785
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,180
 You may never make over $20,000.

786
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,740
 That doesn't change who you are.

787
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,900
 You are a person.

788
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,420
 You are made in the image of God.

789
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,780
 You've been accepted by the one who matters most

790
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,980
 and you have the opportunity to be complete in Christ.

791
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,580
 There's a lot of people that make 200K

792
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,820
 and they're not satisfied and they're empty

793
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,060
 and they find themselves,

794
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,500
 they find their value, their worth,

795
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 their identity in what they do

796
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,100
 rather than operating out of a fullness

797
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,540
 and a satisfaction that is in Christ.

798
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,860
 And Paul says, you and I,

799
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,520
 because of what Jesus did on the cross,

800
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,260
 have access to operating in a way that is fully complete.

801
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,620
 Not that it will need,

802
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,420
 or not that it won't need continually going back

803
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,580
 and abiding with Jesus and helping

804
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,620
 and wrapping my identity around,

805
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,020
 hey, that's not who I am.

806
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,240
 That's not what defines me.

807
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,420
 It's gonna be okay.

808
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,480
 Things fall apart.

809
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,180
 I'm gonna be okay.

810
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,980
 But that only happens when we continue

811
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,420
 to fill and be filled and find our true identity

812
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,020
 in Him and what He says about us.

813
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,940
 One of the ways you can know

814
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,320
 that there could be something

815
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,020
 that is fighting for your identity

816
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,380
 is if there's a sense of anxiety

817
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,300
 over if something was threatening it.

818
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,540
 Maybe it's external looks or maybe it's a job

819
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,580
 or maybe it's, I don't know what it could be.

820
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,740
 Throughout just the past few months,

821
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,180
 I've come through a counselor and community

822
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,540
 and through some people on my team

823
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,060
 to see that there's some ways in which my identity

824
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,060
 has been wrapped up and attached to my job at the porch.

825
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,260
 And really to what God is doing here

826
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,420
 and not in a way that's like, man,

827
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,260
 just build a bigger name,

828
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,980
 but in a way that is unhealthy.

829
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,660
 I mean, it's actually like, man,

830
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,940
 seeing this thing succeed

831
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,140
 and seeing young adults reach and seeing it,

832
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,740
 God in His kindness has helped me begin to see that.

833
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,620
 And just in processing that and seeing

834
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,540
 and just how it could work myself out

835
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,020
 and specifically in the fall,

836
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,220
 there was some additional responsibilities

837
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,420
 that took me out of running

838
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,020
 the day-to-day operations of the porch.

839
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,480
 And that led to me, because of that identity

840
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,580
 and not being okay with,

841
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,840
 man, I don't know how things are gonna go,

842
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,400
 micromanaging from afar,

843
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,900
 being inconsiderate with last minute changes,

844
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,440
 impatient with the status of things,

845
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,440
 unloving and less than sensitive in communication,

846
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,360
 and really damaged some people

847
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,100
 that I love and care about deeply on my team.

848
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,780
 And so through processing with community

849
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
 and through processing just with friends,

850
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,160
 it became clear, man,

851
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,780
 I need to take a step back

852
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,740
 and step towards running through Jesus

853
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,020
 and starve out any part of me

854
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,780
 that thinks my identity is found in the porch.

855
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,260
 In a way that I honestly don't even know

856
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,020
 how long that's been there or how,

857
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,860
 when it developed.

858
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,020
 I was telling someone earlier,

859
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,540
 pretty sure it wasn't 12 years ago.

860
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,580
 I'm pretty sure at some point,

861
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,220
 but I do think being removed didn't create it,

862
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,380
 it exposed it, the ability to let it go.

863
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,940
 So the next little season,

864
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,080
 what I'm gonna do is let it go

865
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,940
 and take a step back in this next few weeks

866
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,740
 in this series in general that we're about to kick off,

867
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,960
 that's gonna be amazing.

868
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,280
 Step back and have a little like,

869
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
 man, God, you got this.

870
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,820
 And any part of me that doesn't believe that,

871
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,800
 you got this and I trust you with that.

872
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
 I'm gonna run after and prioritize loving

873
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,720
 and caring for my team and working on that in myself.

874
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,860
 And the porch in the meantime is gonna be in great hands

875
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,680
 because it will be in the same hands

876
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,580
 it has always been in, which is God's.

877
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,900
 But that being said, we're so pumped.

878
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,820
 We're starting a brand new series next week.

879
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,660
 It's gonna be awesome.

880
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,820
 I can't wait to hear and learn and encourage,

881
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,620
 be encouraged alongside of all of you guys.

882
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,740
 But that's something where I love this ministry.

883
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,680
 I've given over a third of my life to it.

884
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,380
 But I love Jesus more.

885
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
 And I wanna do anything that I can

886
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,260
 to see him take ground and see that identity

887
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,100
 that I know is mine because he said it,

888
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,660
 be experienced and lived out.

889
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,480
 I don't know what you need to let go of.

890
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,980
 And that isn't just some like preaching analogy

891
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,540
 of like, that's me and now you.

892
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,760
 I'm saying, I know that's when I need to.

893
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,460
 And my guess is inside of the room,

894
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,600
 there's something some other ones of us may need to as well.

895
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,580
 The penny that I was gonna hand out of the door

896
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:12,580
 we were just talking through and decided, you know what?

897
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,020
 If they did that, they'd put it in their pocket.

898
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,660
 They wouldn't do anything with it.

899
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,460
 So we scattered them all outside of this room in the lobby.

900
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,860
 All the different locations, my assumption is

901
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,060
 they probably handed them out of the door,

902
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,740
 but it still worked the same way.

903
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,780
 As you walk outside, the reason why we scatter them

904
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,840
 is we're gonna see them all over the ground.

905
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,220
 A lot of us, when we see a penny on the floor,

906
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,140
 like we don't even hesitate.

907
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,140
 We don't even pin it over.

908
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,220
 We don't even think it's worth our time

909
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,620
 to bend over and pick it up.

910
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,740
 And I want you as you walk outside of those doors,

911
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,100
 I want you to grab a penny.

912
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,660
 And when you bend down and when you pick it up,

913
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,780
 I want you to remember

914
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,620
 that is exactly what God through Christ did for you.

915
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,020
 What other people, what other people,

916
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,640
 yourself may even think like, I'm not worthy.

917
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,020
 I'm not worthy of being cared about

918
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,900
 or worthy of being reached out and picked up.

919
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,420
 That question has been answered

920
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,460
 because God through Christ on the cross bend over

921
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,580
 and he loved you and you were so valuable to him

922
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,620
 that he said, I will go to whatever lengths

923
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,900
 and leave heaven itself to stoop down and to pick you up.

924
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,020
 And when you pick up that penny, I want you to think,

925
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,220
 this is how much my God,

926
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,100
 despite the fact that other people may think

927
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,140
 it's not really worth that much,

928
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,100
 you are worth so much to him, no matter the cost,

929
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,500
 that he would stoop down and he would pick it up.

930
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,980
 And the next time you walk along and you see a penny,

931
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,460
 something that other people may pass by

932
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,980
 and not think is any thing of significance,

933
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,020
 I want you to pick it up.

934
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,140
 And I want you to remember the God

935
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,820
 who chases after sinners and broken people

936
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
 who don't think they're worth it,

937
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,780
 don't think they're acceptable and he loves them,

938
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,780
 displays their value to him through the lengths he's gone.

939
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,800
 And remember who you are, whose image is on you,

940
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,640
 how valuable you are, whose acceptance in Christ you have.

941
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,660
 And that you and I are offered a life

942
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,640
 through continually walking with Jesus, we are complete.

943
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,620
 Let me pray.

944
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:22,340
 Father, I thank you that you stoop down

945
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,540
 and you pick up identity,

946
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,280
 broken sinners like me,

947
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,000
 that the links that you go

948
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,280
 for people unworthy,

949
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,460
 quite literally knew no bounds.

950
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,580
 And so I pray for anyone tonight and all of us to have this,

951
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,240
 for any parts in all of our hearts

952
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,200
 where we don't believe that,

953
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,920
 we don't believe you're enough,

954
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,080
 we don't believe who you say we are,

955
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,240
 we don't believe that we've been accepted,

956
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,800
 we don't live in light of that.

957
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,140
 We don't really believe that we could be okay

958
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,140
 if everything was stripped from us because we have you.

959
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,640
 And so God, would you help us by your spirit to believe,

960
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,220
 to rest in, to trust in, to walk with, to abide with,

961
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,440
 to run towards you.

962
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,480
 For for anyone who's never put their faith in Jesus,

963
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,140
 that as they go and they pick up a penny,

964
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:41,320
 the message of a God who left heaven for them,

965
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,040
 who came to earth born as a baby for them,

966
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,680
 who was crucified on a tree for them,

967
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,820
 for their sin,

968
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,860
 and who rose from the dead for them,

969
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,920
 that they would accept not the gift of a single penny,

970
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,880
 but the gift of your son on the cross and his life,

971
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,740
 and by that decision would have eternal life,

972
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,040
 would be redefined, have their past totally forgiven,

973
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,880
 their future totally paid for,

974
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,240
 and be accepted by the one who matters most.

975
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,520
 We love you.

976
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,480
 We worship you now in song, amen.

977
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,240
 (water bubbling)
