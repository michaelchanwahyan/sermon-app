[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]   - For freedom in the history of our nation.
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.160]   - Dallas and Fort Worth, we're advancing the state of the art
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160]   in every aspect.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:23.760]   - Man, let's go.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.640]   Well, hello friends in the room,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.400]   friends in Fort Worth and in Houston
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.360]   and in El Paso and Tulsa and the Woodlands
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.720]   and Spring and all over tuning in with us tonight.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.680]   We are gonna continue this series, New Year Revolution.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.120]   And I'm gonna give us a little bit of story
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.880]   that'll tell us where we're going.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.640]   Two Sundays ago was going to the bank,
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.800]   I need to make a deposit at the ATM.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860]   ATMs not only will give you money,
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.800]   they now give you a place where you can deposit your money.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.360]   Had $300, needed to deposit,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.740]   went up to the ATM driving through,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.000]   begin to put the money inside of there.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.960]   Thank you, Billy.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.320]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.760]   Oh man, stay hydrated, stay hydrated.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.480]   So anyways, at the ATM, putting the dollar bills in there
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.520]   and making a deposit, just some cash
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.840]   that I acquired at our house
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.480]   and needed to put it in the bank.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.920]   I'm depositing it, all of a sudden,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.380]   the money inside of the bank begins to cause
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.400]   some sort of disturbance in the ATM
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.960]   and it begins to go error, error,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.340]   blink, blink, blink, this noise comes on
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.000]   and it says malfunction and gives a phone number
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.520]   to call on the screen there.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520]   And I'm like, oh my gosh.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.960]   And it begins spitting out the money
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.880]   and I'm trying to catch it so the wind doesn't get it.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.860]   And I begin to take this stack of cash
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200]   and I'm thinking, man, maybe it was like
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.580]   a crinkled dollar bill,
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.120]   what would have been the problem here?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.280]   And I begin to count out 'cause I realized,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.040]   I don't know if all of the money came back to me.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   So I begin counting out and the bank
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.360]   had not returned four $20 bills, $80,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   which when you're not rolling, you're like,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.760]   hey, how's it, your boy, that's a lot of money.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.840]   You don't need my money back.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.520]   So I'm calling the people, I'm frustrated,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.880]   I'm like, what just, ATM,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   this ATM that exists solely to give money to you
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.360]   or to give you a place to deposit money
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.060]   had turned into this little thief that had taken my money.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.480]   This automated thief machine
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.840]   that Chase Bank is so excited about,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.640]   yeah, it's gonna click in here in a second
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.840]   for a couple of you guys.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   ATM.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   Anyways, so I'm like, man, I can't believe
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.680]   this stoic take this thing that literally exists
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.480]   to give to me had taken from me.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.320]   And the reason why I start there is because tonight
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.200]   we're talking about the subject of selfishness,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.160]   of self-centered thinking, if you will,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.460]   of entitlement or narcissism,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.600]   of a very pervasive way of thinking for our generation
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.800]   and really just for the world around us
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.040]   of this idea of selfishness.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.420]   And just like an ATM that I went to
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.120]   and I thought it would give to me
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.600]   or give me a place where I can deposit money,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.960]   it would give, it took from me, selfishness,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.280]   entitlement and thinking from an entitled perspective,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   self-centered thinking.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.320]   It's something that often we shift into
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.080]   thinking it will give to us
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440]   and the reality is it always takes from us.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.600]   And tonight we're gonna learn specifically
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.960]   some of the ways that it does from that.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.720]   I mean, you think about how much time you and I
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.900]   think about ourself on a daily basis.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.920]   I mean, if you thought today, like,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.160]   how much time did I spend thinking about me,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.800]   my job, what I look like, what other people think about me,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.120]   I mean, it's like, man, I don't know
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.720]   what else I thought about today.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.360]   I mean, think about, let's just pause for a second.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.840]   Think about, like, the last 10 minutes
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   or the last, the 10 minutes before you got
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.240]   or the porch kicked off, from the time to the car
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.300]   to in here where you're like, oh, man,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.880]   check the mirror before I leave the car, how do I look?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   Gotta look at this car that I'm walking past
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.680]   to see to make sure this hair's in the right place.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.240]   Then I'm walking past the building
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.280]   with these enormous windows on the outside of it
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.840]   and these clearly provide a place
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240]   where I can see my reflection in the glass.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.360]   Then I come in here and I'm like, man,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.000]   where am I going to sit?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840]   And then I wanna make sure that I do whatever I have to
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.440]   and I have to avoid to not talk to anyone
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.720]   before the song starts and then,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.120]   hey, what do these people think of me?
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.360]   And I just left that conversation.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.560]   I wonder what they thought when I said X.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.660]   I wonder what that girl over there is thinking about me.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.760]   She kinda gave me the smile.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.800]   Like, the amount of time that you and I
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.580]   spend thinking about me, I mean, it's a little disturbing
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.480]   if you really stop and think about it.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   The amount of anxiety that we spend
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.520]   over just our insecurities and the way that we think about it
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.800]   and tonight, we're gonna explore what Jesus has to say
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.440]   about the topic of really selfishness or self-centeredness,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.500]   self-focused and how it is costing you and it is killing you
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.000]   and it will kill your relationships.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.900]   It will kill mine.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.480]   It'll hurt your relationship with God.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   It'll hurt your ability or inhibit your ability
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.840]   to experience intimacy and relationships with other people
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.320]   and your purpose on this planet.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.240]   So that's what's at stake.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240]   That's what we're gonna explore.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.320]   What selfishness will take from you?
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.160]   What selfishness?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.000]   We're gonna be in Matthew chapter 20.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.040]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.240]   to Matthew chapter 20.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.060]   Matthew is the first book in the New Testament.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.940]   It is a gospel, which just means it is an account
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.120]   of the life of Jesus.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   There's four of 'em.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   Matthew was a disciple of Jesus, spent time with Jesus.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400]   One of his close friends, he wrote an account
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.280]   on the life of Jesus.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.760]   Here's everything that I observed.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   And Matthew chapter 20 takes us to inside of the story
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.980]   of the book of Matthew, Jesus' last week on the planet.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.480]   He's about to go to the cross.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.840]   He's about to head towards Jerusalem
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.920]   where he's gonna be crucified.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.400]   And as he's going there, he begins to tell this parable.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.600]   And then he has this interaction with his disciples
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.760]   right after it, and he gives us a real indication
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.440]   of how selfishness, how this me first mentality,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.000]   what can I get, get, get, is robbing you
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   and robbed his disciples from experiencing certain things.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.120]   So that's where we're gonna camp out.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.960]   We'll be in verse one.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.560]   We're gonna go all the way through verse 28.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.040]   So if you didn't have a quiet time today,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   you are about to have a quiet time.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.240]   So we are gonna start in verse one,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.060]   and I'll kick us right off as we look at this parable
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.680]   that Jesus launches into that'll give us our first point
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.800]   of the first thing that selfishness will rob us from.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.400]   Here's what he says, verse one.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.440]   Jesus speaking.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.800]   For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.480]   who went out in early morning to hire workers
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.940]   for his vineyard.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.120]   He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.720]   and he sent them to work in his vineyard.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.480]   So Jesus, anytime he tells a parable,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800]   there's always someone who's God.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.000]   There's always someone who's supposed to play
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.120]   like you or me.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.680]   And in this parable, the landowner would represent God,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.280]   and then these different workers would represent people.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.640]   And the landowner went and he found some people,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.660]   showed up at Home Depot, said, hey, I got a vineyard.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.720]   I want you to come work.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.540]   What are you doing today?
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.600]   I'll pay you a day's wages, which is what a denarius.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.520]   So I'll pay you 100 bucks.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.480]   Come work for me.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.080]   Early in the morning, they head out there
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.760]   and they go to work.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.960]   About nine in the morning, he went out
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.800]   and he saw others standing in the marketplace.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.820]   So he goes back to Home Depot and he says, hey,
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.400]   and he told them, you also go work in my vineyard
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.500]   and I will pay you.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.040]   He doesn't say what, he just says whatever is right.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   So they went.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.880]   And he went out again at noon
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.040]   and about three in the afternoon,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.020]   and he did the same thing.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.660]   So he goes again, he goes back to Home Depot,
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.160]   gets some more guys, drops them off at the vineyard,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.520]   goes back, gets more guys, drops them off at the vineyard.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.480]   And about five in the afternoon, he still goes back
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.520]   and he gets another group.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.200]   Five in the afternoon, there's one hour left in the workday.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.420]   He went out and found still others standing around,
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.280]   said, why have you been standing here all day doing nothing
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.580]   because no one's hired us, he said, or they said,
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.860]   and he said to them, you also go work in my vineyard.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.020]   When the evening came, the owner of the vineyard
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.820]   called them to him and called the foreman and said,
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.460]   pay them, beginning with the last ones who were hired,
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.260]   the ones hired at five, and going on to the first.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.400]   The workers who were hired at five in the afternoon
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.260]   each received a denarius.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.300]   So these guys are like, dude, jackpot,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.820]   we gotta work for this guy every day,
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.220]   Home Depot, five p.m., be there.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.640]   Because they just worked one hour
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.400]   and they got an entire day's wages.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.220]   So everybody's lined up and Jesus says,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.580]   he's given this parable and he gives us a principle
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.260]   inside of it that we'll get to in a second,
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.160]   but inside of the parable, the landowner says,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.200]   hey, everybody go out, everyone work,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.680]   if you started at nine a.m., if you started at three p.m.,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.300]   if you started at five, I want you to all line up,
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.100]   I'm gonna pay the first or the last group to arrive first
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.800]   all the way down to the first.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.980]   And so the people who just got a denarius,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.460]   all of a sudden everyone else in line is going,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.900]   oh my gosh, jackpot, we've been here since six a.m.,
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.660]   he gave the people here for one hour $100,
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.400]   he's gonna give us like $1,200, this is amazing,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.800]   best landowner of all time, here's what happens.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.380]   So when those who had hired first came,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.820]   they expected to receive more,
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.940]   but each one of them also received a denarius.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.500]   When they received it,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.900]   they began to grumble against the landowner.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.480]   Those who were hired last worked only one hour,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.980]   and you have made them equal to us
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.060]   who have borne the burden of work and the heat of the day.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.220]   So they look at the landowner
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.940]   and they begin to become discontent or angry,
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.700]   not that he wasn't fair, didn't keep up their end of the deal,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.400]   he said, I'll pay you $100, I'll pay you one denarius.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.660]   But over what he had given to others
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.100]   and what they thought he should have given to them.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.340]   He continues, but he answered,
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.360]   the landowner responds and says,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.080]   I'm not being unfair to you, friend.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.380]   Take your pay and go.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.460]   I wanna give the one who was hired last
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.260]   the same as I gave you.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.220]   Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money?
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.380]   Or are you envious, or your translation may have,
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.760]   is your eye evil?
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.640]   Because I'm generous.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.180]   Are you angry at me?
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.580]   You're bitter towards the landowner
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.040]   and envious of others because of what I gave others.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.380]   So the last will be first and the first will be last.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.500]   Jesus, what are you saying in this?
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.660]   The parable, scholars have identified for long,
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.720]   has salvation implications, there's clear undertones
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.600]   with Jews and Gentiles and a bunch going on,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.100]   but inside of it, there's also a principle for us
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.740]   that applies to the idea of selfishness.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.260]   That applies to really our first point for tonight,
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.860]   which is selfishness will rob you of contentment.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.380]   And inside of the story, what just happened?
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.460]   Was it really selfishness?
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.940]   No, it was comparison and envy,
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.460]   and I would've been upset too.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.380]   They worked one hour, I worked 12.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.540]   We got paid the same.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.700]   That's frustrating.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.160]   Anytime there's discontentment in your life and in my life,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.860]   that is a result, think about it,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:29.260]   not of what you have, but of what others have around you.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.060]   That is the result of selfishness.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.620]   It leads to comparison, leads to jealousy,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.620]   but if you wanna know, hey man,
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.700]   do I have a problem with selfishness?
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.380]   If you look around at what others have
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.620]   makes you discontent, like, hey man,
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.180]   I wish I was married right now,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.780]   and the fact that she just got engaged,
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.100]   it's like, of course, great.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.120]   Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.940]   If that's the response that you have,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.380]   that is a result of selfishness.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.980]   Selfishness will rob from you contentment.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.860]   The first idea from the text, selfishness will rob you,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.380]   it will rob me of contentment.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.600]   That's what happens in the story,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.460]   is they look around, they're the last group,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.400]   and they would not have been frustrated
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.900]   had they not seen what the others had gotten paid.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.580]   Anytime you and I look just like they looked at the landowner,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.120]   look at God and grow frustrated towards him,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.260]   or discontent because, man, he got a new Range Rover,
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.340]   and I don't even, I got a jalopy over here,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.980]   I got nothing to get to work in.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.580]   God, why are you blessing this person?
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.560]   It's a result of a self-seeking selfishness
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.540]   that will rob you and I of contentment.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.940]   I mean, it's gross if you think about it.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.400]   When other people succeed or other things go well,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   and you're like, oh, that's so great for you,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   man, I wish I was you, I'm so angry right now.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.160]   This past week I had a breakfast with a friend of mine
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.900]   who we were getting breakfast, catching up on work stuff,
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.520]   and he works in the business world,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.680]   and he said, man, I'm going to have this conversation.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.400]   My dad is asking me to really take over
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.440]   or play a role in his company in hopes that, you know,
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.800]   eventually I'm gonna transition off into his company.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.680]   And it's like a very, it was one of those like,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.720]   dude, you are gonna be set for life, that is amazing.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.760]   And I wish that I was just going, that's incredible.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.440]   But in my heart of hearts, I was like,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.520]   oh, man, I wish I was you.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.300]   Is your dad, will he hire me?
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.720]   Is he looking to adopt?
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.260]   And it was just jealous.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.140]   I mean, what is that?
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's a selfishness, self-seeking, just disgusting thing
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.080]   that can pop up where you're like,
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.040]   man, I can't even be happy for you,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.640]   really genuinely happy for you
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.400]   because of a selfishness that robs me of contentment.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.080]   I have no reason to be jealous of him.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.240]   I've got more than enough,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   but it's just the fact of knowing
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.240]   that that had just happened for him
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.200]   that it leads to a discontentment.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   I mean, you ever seen like someone,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.480]   I mean, people's day gets ruined over the fact
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.440]   that they found out their roommate
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   just got a raise or a promotion.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.880]   People's day gets ruined over the fact that,
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.680]   oh my gosh, of course, he asked her out.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.560]   I cannot believe this.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.160]   I just need some time alone right now.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.000]   Think about that.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.120]   Like how dark and gross is that in all of us?
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.840]   And it's a selfishness that leads to a discontentment
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.520]   because selfishness will rob you and I of contentment.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.920]   There is a solution that we're gonna get to at the end.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   But the first idea of what it will take from you
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.600]   anytime you and I allow ourselves to slip in there
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.400]   is contentment and an inability to celebrate
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.060]   others in our life,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.360]   that we just like the first group don't truly trust
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.560]   that God will give his people whatever is right.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.160]   I mean, this is also what appears whenever,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   I mean, we see this a lot of the ports
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.080]   where all of a sudden somebody would represent,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.240]   if you will, the 9 a.m. group.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.440]   It's like, look, I've been here at Watermark six years.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.480]   I've been serving.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.800]   I'm in a community group.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.960]   I'm serving in 19 different places.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.920]   I'm all in.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.760]   I've been here.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.580]   I've been faithful.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.680]   I've been getting it done.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.880]   And this girl showed up.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   She's been here like a week.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   And all of a sudden, she's getting married to Mr. Right.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.860]   She's got everything going, everything.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.320]   And she hadn't even proven herself.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.480]   Like she just got safe,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.600]   still smells like the world, just got here.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.440]   And I'm--
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.840]   She's a 5 p.m. girl.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.880]   I've been here since 9 freaking a.m.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.000]   Ain't got nothing.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.040]   I mean, that is a bitterness
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   that's a result of selfishness.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.880]   (laughing)
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.720]   I don't know what the world smells like, so.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.200]   But it's a bitterness that comes from selfishness
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.360]   robbing you of contentment.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.860]   Jesus continues and he says something else.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.900]   And what happens next is almost comical,
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.180]   tragically comical.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.460]   But where he goes next is so he just tells this story
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.300]   about like, man, how terrible it is.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.180]   And so it's like me first, me first, me first,
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.220]   positioning himself and what about me, what about me?
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.300]   And he just tells this parable
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.260]   and he gives us that principle
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.180]   of just the grossness of that mentality.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.420]   And then he goes into this really intimate moment
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.980]   with his 12 disciples.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.280]   Stops the story and he goes
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.580]   and he's walking with his guys.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.520]   And he goes in and he begins to tell them like,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.140]   man, I'm about to go get killed.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.380]   And what happens after that is two of his disciples
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.740]   in a way that is beyond my ability to understand,
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.500]   decide, man, this is the perfect moment
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.300]   to ask him for a favor right now.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.860]   We're gonna get our mom involved.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.300]   True story, mom involved.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.540]   Here's what happens next.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.500]   Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.340]   and on the way he took the 12 aside.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.340]   So he grabs just the 12 of them and he said to them,
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.080]   we're now going up to Jerusalem
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.600]   and the son of man, that's Jesus,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.420]   will be delivered over to the chief priests
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.020]   and the teachers of the law.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   They will condemn him to death
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.000]   and will hand him over to the Gentiles
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.220]   to be mocked, to be flogged or brutally whipped
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.560]   and to be crucified.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.940]   Essentially killed through torture.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.700]   And on the third day he will rise.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.620]   So Jesus pulls, I mean, it's super intimate,
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.460]   like, hey, I'm about to go die.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.960]   I'm about to be killed.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.540]   This would be like someone pulling you in and saying,
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.260]   man, I have cancer
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.820]   and I only have a certain amount of time to live.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.860]   That's what Jesus just said.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.140]   I only have a certain few days.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.140]   And here's where his disciples go next.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.540]   Then the mother of Zebedee's sons,
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.560]   which is James and John, freaking mother of Zebedee,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.260]   came to Jesus with her sons,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.380]   kneeling down and asked a favor of him.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.380]   What is it you want, he asked.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.100]   She said, so the mother of James and John,
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.500]   for whatever reason, they're like, man,
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.620]   not sure what he's talking about, the whole dying thing,
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.800]   but this feels like a great time to pop the question.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.420]   Mom, let's do this.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.740]   And so they come, get before Jesus,
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.500]   just them and their mom, and he says,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.940]   my mom has a request, you know,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.800]   maybe she's elderly, you wanna give it to her?
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.740]   And it relates to us, so they're right before Jesus,
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.420]   and here's what they say.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.020]   Grant that these two sons of mine may sit at your right
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.400]   and at your left hand in your kingdom.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.900]   So Jesus just says, hey, I'm about to go be killed.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.460]   This is like, hey, your best friend saying,
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.420]   I'm about to die, and they're worried about seats?
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.260]   They're worried about, hey, where,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.820]   they're positioning themselves,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.500]   hey, where am I gonna sit for all of eternity?
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.020]   I mean, this is like your best friend dying,
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.380]   and you being like, hey, I'm sorry about that shotgun,
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.380]   and that's what just happened.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.840]   Or they're going, hey, can we sit here,
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.880]   and can we sit here?
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.160]   And Jesus responds, and he says,
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.740]   you don't know what you're asking.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.760]   Jesus said to them, can you drink the cup
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.780]   that I'm going to drink, talking about his death?
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.900]   We can, they answered, so they're like,
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.420]   yeah, totally, love that idea.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.900]   I can totally drink the cup.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.540]   I have no idea what that means, but yes, we can do it.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.180]   Just focused on themself.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.200]   Jesus said to them, you will indeed drink the cup,
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.780]   talking about suffering and dying for him,
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.700]   but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.940]   These places belong to those for whom
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.620]   it has been prepared by my Father.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.540]   When the other 10 heard of these two boys
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.180]   taking this moment where Jesus says,
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.820]   man, I'm about to go die, and they're like,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.380]   hey, yeah, that's great, sorry about that.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.620]   Can we sit here and here?
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.280]   When the other 10 heard, they became indignant
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.600]   with these two brothers.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.380]   Like, they don't come rushing to Jesus' aid and go,
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.020]   man, I cannot believe that you just said,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.520]   just told us he was about to die, guys.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.660]   You brought in your freaking mom, really?
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.740]   You think this is the best time?
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.220]   They're not angry at the brothers
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.360]   for being not compassionate towards Jesus.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.080]   They're angry because they wanna sit in those seats.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.020]   Because they too, like those, like James and John,
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.380]   had a selfishness that was taken from them.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.020]   They couldn't even think about what Jesus was saying
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.380]   'cause they were consumed with themselves,
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.860]   with their own future, with what they would get.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.300]   The second idea from this text that it gives us
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.280]   is just the selfishness will rob you and I of compassion.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.480]   Like, in this side of the text,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.500]   they're unable to be compassionate towards Jesus
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.720]   who just said, man, I'm about to go die,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.020]   'cause all they can think about is like,
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.600]   yeah, that's pretty rough, but hey, quick question.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.300]   Can I sit here and can we sit here?
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.260]   Just can we get your top positions?
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.580]   You can be on the middle throne,
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.460]   but how about we're kind of on each side of you?
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.980]   It'll be great.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.380]   They're unable to be compassionate
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.100]   because of a selfishness that was robbing them
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.140]   of compassion.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.180]   A second idea is that,
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.940]   that selfishness will rob you and I of compassion.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.040]   I mean, it's not clear to, or it's not hard to see
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.120]   that in your life and my life,
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.880]   one of the key things that robs us of compassion
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.500]   is a self-focus.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.020]   Like, I think it looks a lot different
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   than these two guys standing before Jesus
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.540]   where you're like, man, that's so awkward.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.620]   They're just socially unaware.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.660]   Man, James and John, how could you do that?
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.680]   In our life, it manifests itself like this,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   a anxiety that makes us unable to care
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.740]   or be compassionate towards other people around
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.580]   'cause I'm so worried about what I'm going through
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.020]   and does God even know what I'm going through?
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.860]   Where's my job?
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.580]   Am I ever gonna get promoted here?
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.660]   Am I ever gonna get married?
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.140]   And when am I gonna get married?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.460]   And my biological clock is ticking
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.740]   and I'm just so consumed with what other people
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.100]   are thinking about me and I wonder what they thought
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.900]   about me and what happened to my past relationship
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.360]   or is he, maybe he's not gonna,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.540]   maybe we're not gonna get married.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.380]   Anytime there's anxiety, it creeps in
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.220]   and leads to this focus on self where it's impossible
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.540]   when you're anxious to begin to take your eyes
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.880]   off of yourself and care for those around you.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.840]   Or insecurity, think about how much insecurity
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.700]   has robbed our ability to be compassionate.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.660]   You walk into a room and all you can think about
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.440]   is man, I don't, what are they thinking about me?
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.500]   Do they like me?
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.100]   Where should I sit?
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.220]   And you're unable to just look at other people around you,
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.180]   care for them, engage with them, see them as people
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.940]   who have stories, who have pains,
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.420]   who have things that they're walking through.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.380]   I mean, just think about it in all of us, in me.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.300]   Busyness, a focus on self.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.960]   Some of the ways that selfishness manifests itself
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.300]   is just how busy we can be.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.020]   Like hey, I don't have time right now.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.980]   I'm kinda rushing to church
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.180]   and I gotta do this ministry stuff.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.540]   I don't have time to stop and care for this person.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.440]   That selfishness can rob you and I of being compassionate
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.200]   or the ability to be compassionate.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.760]   I, man, I like, this one is so hard for me
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   and so convicting to talk about, honestly,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.500]   'cause this is a hard one for me.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.680]   I can very easily be insensitive
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.560]   and those who know me well know that.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.200]   I can be, I can frustrate teammates
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   or people that I work with.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.080]   I even asked our team today and I was like,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.000]   hey, I'd love to know and I want the truth
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.120]   the ways that I have hurt you
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.460]   or the ways that I consistently,
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.020]   the parts of me that I just, I can hurt you.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.480]   By the time they got done answering,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.880]   I was like, I'd like a little less truth in this.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.840]   And one of 'em, true story, one of 'em,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.000]   I was like, I just wanna know,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.800]   how does that manifest itself in me?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.720]   How am I not compassionate or how am I not caring for you?
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.960]   And one, literally, she goes, oh, man, easy, got this.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.840]   Ah, and I was like, (congregation laughing)
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.920]   maybe you take some time to think about it a little bit.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.280]   And some of the ways that they said was,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.840]   hey, you can be so distracted that you're not in the moment.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.760]   You're like there, but you're not really,
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.800]   you can tell that your mind's somewhere else
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.080]   or you can cut people off and you don't listen fully
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.180]   to what they're trying to say
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.240]   'cause you think that they know
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.480]   or you think you know already what they're about to say.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   And I was like, man.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.140]   Another one was, hey, sometimes,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.940]   you can be distracted by your phone
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.320]   or by somebody emailing or somebody text messaging
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.360]   or something else going on.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.920]   Another one said, you can just be insensitive
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.960]   to people with the words that you say.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.160]   I can have a really strong first step
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   in things that I don't, I'm just wired
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.440]   to where I have a strong first step
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   and I don't always believe in it.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.880]   I'm like, dude, we should get rid of these screens,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.560]   get everything off the stage.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.660]   And then in an hour, I'm like,
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.360]   ah, I don't even know if that's a good idea.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.560]   But I can, in doing so, really wound people
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.960]   who put a lot of work into whatever
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.400]   my strong first step can attack.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.620]   And it's just an insensitivity, not compassionate.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.240]   And I, you may be like me, I need,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.720]   this is an area where I go, thank God,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.080]   I need you to just, I need you to take ground in my heart
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.160]   because I don't wanna be robbed
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.520]   of being able to be compassionate towards people.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   And I am, I'm insensitive and I hate it.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.760]   We talk on our team a lot about,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   hey, the type of person that you wanna be here
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.920]   is not a James and John.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.440]   You don't wanna be a, hey, here I am, look at me person.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.720]   You wanna be a, man, there you are type of person.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.240]   Like, if we divided everyone in the room,
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.920]   we said, man, there's two types of people in the world.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.320]   There's the here I am, look at me, come on, check it out,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.360]   holler at your girl, holler at your guy, here I am.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.700]   This has got it going on.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.880]   That type of person that's fighting for the spotlight,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.580]   fighting for the attention.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.840]   And then there's a, man, there you are person.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.540]   Gosh, look at him, they're, oh, they're amazing.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.380]   My whole day's made right now.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.520]   And how we don't wanna be a here you are,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.380]   the Bible and scripture unleashes,
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.900]   or says Christians are this type of there you are person
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.960]   unleashed into the world.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   And even that, man, is convicting as we just discussed.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.160]   'Cause I, in neutral, I am not a there you are person.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.120]   I'm a here I am person.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.960]   And I hate it.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.880]   There's people on our staff,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.400]   there's a guy named John Elmore who's like,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.920]   dude, he's like the best there you are person in the world.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.840]   If you know him, you know that.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.820]   If you don't, I can like, I can imitate him.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.160]   He's like, oh my gosh, you're here.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.200]   Oh, my day's made, look at it, he's here again.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.000]   Look, he put on a shirt, this is amazing.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.040]   He's incredible, he shaved today.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.440]   Ah, you did it.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   And I'm like, man, that's awesome.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.800]   Although I'm easy on the other end, I'm like,
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.280]   I am here, look at me.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.660]   Yes, I put on a shirt, this is great.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.040]   I'm like, gosh.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.840]   Man, John, I wanna be more like you.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.640]   I wanna be more like, man, there you are.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.760]   My God is a God who's like, man, there you are.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.860]   And even in telling that to John,
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.240]   if you tell John, man, I wanna be more like you, John,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   he'd be like, you wanna be more like Jesus.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.220]   We all need to be.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.080]   But a question for you is, man, are you a there you are
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.980]   or here I am person?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.440]   And what ways do you need to surrender that?
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.120]   Like me, God, just take ground in more of our hearts.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.680]   Jesus continues and he gives us the last thing
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.560]   that really selfishness will rob us of
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.240]   as he finishes up responding to these brothers.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.960]   So he called all the disciples together,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.020]   seeing their selfishness and seeing the way
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.120]   that they saw the world or sought to seek personal gain.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.400]   He calls all of them together and he says,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.760]   man, you're thinking wrong.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.280]   He said, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.920]   lord it over them.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.840]   Like the rulers of this world, he essentially says,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.140]   you know how the way that the world thinks?
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.680]   Where if you're in leadership or if you have power,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.400]   whatever you can do to get me, me, me, me, me, you do it.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.440]   They exercise authority over them.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.240]   That's not how you're gonna think, not so with you.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.100]   Instead, whoever wants to be great,
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.900]   and he introduces maybe the most revolutionary idea
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.940]   about greatness in history in the next sentence.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.200]   That whoever wants to be great must be your servant.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.900]   Whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.160]   Just as the son of man did not come to be served,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.940]   that's Jesus, God in a bod shows up and he says,
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.280]   I'm not here to be served, but to serve
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   and to lay down his life, to give it as a ransom for many.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.820]   Jesus says, man, you guys,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.660]   you think just like the world thinks.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.440]   Like me first, me, me, me.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.880]   How can I get first in line?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.560]   What do they think about me?
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.880]   And he says, man, among my followers,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.800]   it's not to be that way.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   You're not to be someone who seeks
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   to get in the front of the line,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.840]   you seek to serve those around you just like the savior
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.300]   that you worship and that you follow is.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.320]   The third idea that really selfishness will rob you
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.880]   and I of is true greatness.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.160]   The third thing that he says, man,
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.640]   if you wanna be robbed from selfishness,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.320]   it will inhibit you to experiencing true greatness.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.760]   You will never experience it.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.160]   If you allow the greatness of the world to be your standard,
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.360]   or if you don't kill the selfishness inside of you,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.280]   if you don't learn to be a servant of all,
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.400]   that selfishness will rob you and I of true greatness.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.680]   But he says, my followers are to be revolutionary,
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.180]   unordinary in a world where selfishness is ordinary.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.180]   They are to unleash extraordinary selflessness
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.300]   and serve the world around them just like God did
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.220]   when he showed up on the planet.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.980]   Just like Jesus did when he showed up,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.980]   not going in and saying, man,
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.740]   do these people know how important I am?
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.680]   I'm freaking God, I created this place.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.260]   But he said, I came here to serve, to care.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.620]   And so it will be for my followers that they show up
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.040]   and the mentality that they have is not to be served,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.860]   but in every situation to serve.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   And he redefines even what greatness is,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.700]   which is so relevant and so hard for me to believe.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.960]   Where he says, look, you guys think that greatness
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.720]   is whenever you have the job title,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.200]   whenever you have the future marriage,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.360]   if you're a super mom, if you're a super model,
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.720]   if you are a celebrity someday, if you're an athlete,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   a professional sports athlete,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.920]   if you drive a certain car, you finally bought the house,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.000]   you look a certain way, you have certain number of abs
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.060]   that can show through, whatever that is
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.960]   that you think greatness is, he says, you're off.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.860]   If you want to be great,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.160]   if you wanna wake up tomorrow morning,
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.040]   and man, this is like so huge for all of us
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.760]   to know and to believe.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.660]   If you wanna be great tomorrow, you wake up and you serve.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.420]   You seek to serve Jesus by serving others.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.680]   I mean, here's what I know.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.860]   I'm not the smartest cat in the book.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.280]   I'm not the most talented, not the wealthiest,
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.820]   don't have the most resources, don't have the most gifts,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.660]   but here's what I know.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.920]   I can wake up tomorrow and I can be truly great
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.560]   because it doesn't involve any of those things.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.040]   It involves being a servant in the name of Christ.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.260]   And you can wake up, regardless of your story,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.580]   regardless of where you are,
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.280]   regardless of where you work or don't work,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.600]   regardless of the classes that you're in or not in
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.020]   or the major you didn't get into,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.440]   you can wake up and you can experience,
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.880]   Jesus would say, true greatness.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.900]   But it won't come from you serving yourself.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.060]   You'll never get there.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.140]   Crazy thing is like, I think we look,
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.760]   even the people who finally arrive in Standard of the World
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.400]   of like, man, that's so great up there,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.580]   a celebrity or whatever.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.700]   They always look back and they say, man, this thing is empty.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.580]   There's no life here.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.320]   This is not what greatness is.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.180]   And down here, you're like, oh, dude,
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.140]   I can't really believe that.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.680]   If I was there, it would be, I mean,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.200]   the most recent example or most relevant example
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.440]   probably comes from Tom Brady, who,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.740]   you guys watch the Super Bowl?
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.860]   Everybody see this?
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.860]   Dude, crazy, Brady, gosh, man, retire already, buddy.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860]   You're over the hill.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.320]   And Tom was, I mean, unbelievable comeback.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.980]   If you didn't watch it, man, you gotta get a TV or something
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.060]   but inside of the game, he did what no person
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.100]   has ever done in NFL history.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.660]   First quarterback with five Super Bowl rings.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.220]   They're calling him the GOAT, the greatest of all time.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.980]   They're saying, or he set records in terms of,
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.880]   hey, it's never been that big of a deficit
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.120]   that someone's come back for.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.640]   I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.960]   And you would think that him and even just like his story,
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.320]   his life, that he would be someone
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.280]   that looks around at the world and says,
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.880]   man, yeah, this is pretty, this is where life is.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.400]   I mean, he's married to Gisele,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.960]   who's not just like, not just any model.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.760]   She's like the supermodel of supermodels,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.080]   Victoria's Secret model.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.360]   He's got the life that you would think,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.960]   hey, $60 million.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.560]   It's like, dude, if anybody would say,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.960]   man, this is what greatness is, it would be you.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.100]   And yet, in interviews that you read that he's done,
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.260]   he would say the very opposite.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.340]   Man, this is not where life is.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.180]   There's something else out there.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.820]   In fact, 60 Minutes did an interview with him not long ago
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.580]   where he said this inside of the interview,
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.080]   and I just thought I'd read it.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.300]   Why do I have three, Tom Brady speaking,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.220]   he's been interviewed.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.820]   Why do I have three Super Bowl rings,
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.940]   or you could insert five now,
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.900]   and still think there's something greater out there for me?
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.300]   I mean, a lot of people would say, hey, man, this is it.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.220]   I reached my goal, my dream, my life.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   But me, I think, God, there's gotta be
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.420]   more than this out there.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.100]   I mean, this can't be all that it's cracked up to be.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.840]   It's got everything that everyone wants,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.940]   and I'm still not satisfied.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.140]   It's not that great.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.120]   And the reporter asked him, what's the answer?
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.080]   I wish I knew, Tom says.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.380]   I wish I knew what the answer is.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.380]   But Tom will eventually find out,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.360]   if he doesn't find out on this side of eternity
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.440]   is the answer to where greatness is found
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.040]   is always found in a person named Jesus.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.880]   And if he ever experiences that greatness,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.120]   if he ever experiences just that satisfaction,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.360]   you can hear it in the aching of his words.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.080]   You almost just wanna leap off the page and say,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.960]   Tom, it's Jesus!
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.760]   It's only in him that you're gonna find it.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.120]   It's no Super Bowl rings, no amount of success,
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.160]   no marriage, no woman, no man
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.000]   that's ever gonna satisfy you.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.720]   It's only in knowing and serving Jesus.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.040]   And if you ever experience that, Tom,
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.400]   or insert your name, it'll be found in knowing Jesus
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.460]   and serving him.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.720]   By serving the world around you,
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.120]   Jesus says you wanna be great.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.920]   You wanna wake up tomorrow and experience greatness.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.040]   Don't fall for the same selfish lie
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.480]   the world around you of looking out for me first,
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.920]   me first, but seek to serve, and you'll experience that.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.520]   I think a message like this, it begs the question of,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.880]   like, man, how do I do this?
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.600]   How do I just become less self-focused?
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.720]   Like, I don't wanna be this.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.520]   I wanna be like, oh man, that's amazing.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.400]   I wanna genuinely celebrate stuff
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.300]   that God's doing in your life.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.800]   I wanna be compassionate.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.600]   I wanna be experiencing true greatness.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.700]   My knee jerk is I just wanna serve.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.840]   Or just try harder.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.880]   Just say, man, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.800]   I'm not gonna care about me.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.920]   I'm gonna stop looking at me
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.880]   and look over there and care for people.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.400]   It doesn't work.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.800]   Scripture never teaches that.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.180]   Scripture tells us that the way that you and I
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.720]   take our eyes off of ourself is by placing them on Jesus.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.200]   We redirect our focus.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.920]   We take the way that we'll experience freedom
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.040]   from all of just the wants and the desires and the self,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.960]   me, me, me, me, me, me, me, and I'm so worried about me,
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.680]   me, me, the way that we stop looking at ourself
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.600]   is not by just trying harder, shutting our eyes,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.800]   is by redirecting our eyes or redirecting our attention
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.000]   and placing it on Jesus.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.920]   And the more that you and I look at Jesus,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.320]   the more we begin to look like Jesus.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.560]   Now stay with me 'cause you're like, man,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.880]   it's so like, it's tweetable,
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.560]   but I don't know what that means.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.380]   Stay with me.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.640]   Because in Jesus, we find the answer
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.760]   to the thing that we really want.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.880]   All these different like things,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.240]   our heart's crying out for, I want this,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.300]   I want this, I want this.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.320]   It's in a moment where we turn our attention
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.120]   and day by day, turn our attention to him,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.720]   we experience the thing we've always wanted,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.480]   the thing we most deeply want, which is him.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.980]   My son is 13 months old and I'm gonna land the plane here.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.520]   We are about to land the plane.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.700]   He is at the stage where he's like
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.960]   trying to figure out how to talk and he can't talk.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.560]   And so when he wants things, he's also going through this,
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.120]   like, hey, I want everything.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.200]   So he will just go, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.600]   whatever the thing is, whether it's like,
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.400]   hey, that's a knife, you can't have that, buddy,
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.280]   you'll poke yourself.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.640]   Or it's this plate or these keys or milk or whatever, ball.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.760]   And so we'll just walk around and he's constantly going,
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.360]   I want, I want, I want.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.680]   And there's one thing that we have that like
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.360]   is the only thing that whenever it's in front of his face,
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.760]   that's the only thing that he wants.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.440]   He always wants it more than everything else there.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   It's this like stuffed animal doll that he sleeps with,
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.280]   they puppy, it's actually a dog toy, but he loves it.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.440]   And so anytime he's like, oh, I want, I want,
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.400]   we'll like pull out puppy and he just grabs it
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.280]   and he holds on.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.640]   It's the thing that no matter what he says I want,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.880]   he always wants it more,
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.400]   whether or not he even realizes it until he sees it.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.520]   This is the way that it is with Jesus in your life
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.160]   and in my life, whatever you think like, man,
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.480]   I just want that so bad, God, give it to me.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.320]   At the end of the day, the thing that all of us
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.220]   want more than any of that, whether or not you realize it,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.880]   it's him, it's Jesus.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.600]   Like a child who in a moment says, look,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.520]   whatever I was wanting, all of a sudden,
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.260]   when I see that stuffed animal, my attention is redirected.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.480]   I want that more.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.440]   In the same way, you and I,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   whatever that you find yourself going,
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.960]   I'm just can't get over this.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.880]   I'm so worried about this.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.040]   The more that you see, the more your attention,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.380]   once it is placed on Jesus,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.420]   you see the thing that you've always wanted more.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.880]   You always will want more.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.680]   The thing that whether or not you realize it,
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.380]   you want more than anything in this world, which is him.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.200]   And the level to which you and I will experience that
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.520]   will be found in our turning attention on him.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.440]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.160]   Because you're like, man, that sounds so good,
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.320]   but how do I actually do that?
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.540]   That's why we do everything that we do here at Watermark.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.720]   That's why we do community groups.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.760]   That's why we do the ports.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.480]   That's why the Shane sing the songs that they do
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.440]   is to get all of our attention.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.620]   We're just gonna look at Jesus.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.240]   We're gonna help one another, look at Jesus.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.280]   I need to look at his character, at his love,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.840]   at who he is revealed in God's word.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.360]   I need to be reminded of what is true,
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.240]   what he says about me, what he did on the cross,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.320]   how he changed the world,
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.240]   and on the calendar I dated today,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.680]   it spoke of the time that he was on this planet.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.720]   I need to look at him, and in doing so,
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.120]   I begin to experience freedom
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.180]   from all these things that I think that I want,
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.120]   and I begin to experience satisfaction
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.900]   by looking at the one that I've always wanted more,
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.560]   that we help one another.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.080]   That involves looking at his word,
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.160]   knowing who he is, walking day by day in prayer,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.500]   studying his word with other people in our life,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.280]   walking with him, and you begin to see him.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.440]   The scripture says you begin to be changed when you see him.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.280]   If you've ever wondered how people have changed here,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.760]   that's the answer.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.600]   They begin to see Jesus, and the things of this world
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:52.360]   begin to grow dim in the light of his glory and grace,
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.240]   and they're changed.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.480]   And if you experience that, you will be too.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.600]   I'm afraid that would be the case.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.120]   Father, we love you, we thank you
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.400]   that you are patient with us,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.760]   that you, despite our selfish,
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   my selfish, self-centered heart,
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.280]   full of entitlement and pride and envy,
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.920]   man, God, you are slow to anger,
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.400]   abounding in steadfast love.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.780]   You are patient with us.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.400]   Thank you that you came and you died in our place,
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.160]   that you're God, man, I don't even know
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   how to say thank you for that,
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.780]   that you're God who didn't come to be served,
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.160]   but to serve, you gave your life for me,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.200]   for my friends here.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.880]   What kind of love is this?
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.360]   What kind of God are you?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.560]   The one who is there.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.280]   Father, would you allow us to see Jesus more in our lives?
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.000]   For anyone who doesn't know Jesus,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.520]   would tonight be their night?
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.480]   They step into a relationship with a God
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   who doesn't want something from them,
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.400]   but wants them to know what he did for them.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.240]   Would that happen?
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.320]   Father, we worship you now in song, amen.
