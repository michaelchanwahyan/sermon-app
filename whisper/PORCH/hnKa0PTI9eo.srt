1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,740
 (phone dialing)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,540
 - You have seven unheard messages.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,220
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,280
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,740
 - Hey yo, Danny!

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,420
 Where you at, bro?

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,260
 I'll see you soon, all right?

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,380
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,740
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,660
 on my heart for a reason, so please call me back.

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,020
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,340
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

14
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,820
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,260
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

16
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,020
 - Not sure if this is the right number,

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,940
 but last night was a mistake.

18
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,860
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,100
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,180
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,640
 and we need to talk.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,940
 - All right, Ports, how we doing tonight?

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,580
 You doing okay?

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,220
 It's great to see you.

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,380
 Everybody in the front, y'all doing good?

27
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,620
 Everybody in the top, you doing all right?

28
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,780
 It's amazing to be here.

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,660
 So glad that y'all would choose to join us

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,820
 as we're continuing through our dating series,

31
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,660
 We Need to Talk.

32
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,860
 I'm so excited for where we're going,

33
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,000
 but we need to say hello to a couple of people

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,820
 that are joining us here tonight.

35
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
 Number one, we want to say hello

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,100
 to everybody that's joining us in the chapel.

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,980
 We're so grateful that y'all would make the time

38
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,100
 and kind of stay steadfast to the cause

39
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,460
 and not give up on the evening,

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,020
 though you may not have gotten a seat in this room.

41
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,700
 We're so glad that you would be here with us.

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,860
 And then we're so grateful

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,220
 that the work God's doing in Dallas

44
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,160
 is a work he's doing in other cities all over our nation,

45
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,740
 particularly those cities

46
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,300
 where we have Porch Live locations, just like this one.

47
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,820
 So shout out to all of you guys,

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,260
 but very particularly Porch Live, Greater Lafayette,

49
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,440
 Porch Live, Fresno, and Porch Live, Scottsdale.

50
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,860
 Well, Porch, there was a moment early

51
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,320
 in mine and Brooke's dating experience

52
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,700
 that to this day is still the stuff of hot debate.

53
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,020
 And so what I wanted to do

54
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,820
 is I wanted to let you into the chat

55
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,700
 and see if you could help us settle the dispute.

56
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
 Does that sound okay?

57
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,980
 Are you up for that?

58
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,620
 So it was at this time in our relationship

59
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,540
 where we weren't even officially dating yet.

60
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,040
 You see, we'd spent a lot of time around each other,

61
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,820
 and we had even piqued one another's interest.

62
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,060
 But for a variety of reasons,

63
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,300
 namely I had some commitment issues,

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,660
 we had not gone out on a date yet.

65
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,020
 And yet that was all gonna change.

66
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,260
 Like I had finally run my course and had my fill,

67
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,140
 and I was ready to ask her out.

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,540
 And so I knew that is all going to finally change

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,580
 at the annual organizational Christmas party.

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,260
 This is the moment that I was waiting for.

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,780
 Like I knew this was the time

72
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,580
 when we would have the perfect moment in the perfect place

73
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,820
 to be able to look one another in the eye

74
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,100
 and say that we're gonna go out together.

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,380
 And so I made up my mind coming into that evening,

76
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,900
 by the end of the night, I was going to ask her out.

77
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,700
 And simultaneous to that,

78
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,260
 she had made up her mind completely separate of me

79
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,380
 that if I didn't ask her out, she was gonna move on.

80
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,740
 And so the evening came,

81
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,980
 and I was in leadership of this kind of club thing

82
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,820
 that we were involved in.

83
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,900
 So I had some duties to the people.

84
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,340
 And by the end of the evening,

85
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,020
 after I'd said goodbye to all of our guests,

86
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,940
 and I had made sure to say hello to some friends,

87
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,540
 and I kind of closed the event down,

88
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,460
 I knew that perfect moment in that perfect place

89
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,500
 had finally arrived.

90
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,900
 And so as I'm making my way to ask her,

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,180
 "Hey, will you go on a date with me?"

92
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,740
 It was right in that moment that I got sidelined

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,280
 by another person, a girl at that,

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,440
 which required a long conversation of me

95
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
 because there was something really big happening

96
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,020
 in her life, and she wanted to be able to process it.

97
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,580
 It certainly didn't help optics that I was talking to her,

98
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,420
 and I wasn't talking to Brooke.

99
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,660
 And yet I concluded that conversation swiftly,

100
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,220
 and I started searching, trying to find where Brooke was.

101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,660
 She'd already left.

102
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,260
 And I was gutted.

103
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,060
 Like this was that moment.

104
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,140
 Perfect time, perfect place.

105
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
 It was Christmas.

106
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,340
 Like merriment was in the air.

107
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,940
 The lights were twinkling above.

108
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,060
 The night sky was cool and refreshing to be out in.

109
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,140
 But not to be deterred, I decided I was going to call her.

110
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,740
 Now we'd hung out a lot, but I had never given her a call.

111
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,420
 There had never been a good reason to,

112
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,080
 and yet now I had the perfect reason to.

113
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
 And so I decide, you know what?

114
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,140
 Hey, a call is not exactly the picture perfect scenario,

115
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,280
 but she's gonna see my name pop up.

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,920
 And I mean, that's gonna be surprising to her.

117
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
 Like, why might he be calling?

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
 And I'm sure he'll have a good reason, and she'll pick up,

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,560
 and we'll pick right back up where we would have been.

120
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,360
 And so I dial her number, and it rings,

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
 and it rings, and it rings.

122
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,780
 And then it went straight to voicemail.

123
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,940
 For the love of God, why is this so hard?

124
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,260
 So I decided to hang up, and I would just wait,

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,760
 by the phone, mind you, until she called me back.

126
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,520
 Only she never did.

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,760
 Herein lies the dispute that I need your help with.

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,020
 Should I have left a voicemail or not?

129
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:20,880
 In my estimation, having never called her before,

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,960
 knowing that when you see someone who you know

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,400
 in your call log, the natural response is to call them back.

132
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
 Yes?

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,480
 - Yes.

134
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 - And yet, in her opinion, if you don't get a voicemail,

135
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,820
 then you don't get a call back.

136
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,880
 Now, the verdict is still out

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,260
 on what we actually think of this situation.

138
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,800
 You see, there's a lot that can be argued about both sides.

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,440
 If I really laid my case before you, I have no doubt

140
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
 that I'd get a grandstand of applause,

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
 and you would all side with me.

142
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,880
 But that's neither here nor there.

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
 You see, good cases can be made either way.

144
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,580
 And the reason for that is because in dating,

145
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,320
 there's always room to debate

146
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,160
 whether someone went far enough.

147
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,000
 You see, that was the issue in our moment.

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,920
 I thought I had gone far enough,

149
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,400
 but she was looking at me and saying,

150
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,960
 "You definitely did not go far enough."

151
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,680
 And it's in those moments in dating

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,920
 where we can really debate the specifics,

153
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,520
 but you cannot debate when you've gone too far.

154
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,120
 You see, you can always look at one another

155
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,440
 and you can wonder, like, should you or shouldn't you

156
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,360
 bring flowers on the first date?

157
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,180
 Is it good for you to make sure

158
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,500
 that you buy all of the meals whenever it is

159
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
 you're together with sidebar guys?

160
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,060
 If it's a date, then you definitely

161
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,880
 should be picking up the tab.

162
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,940
 When is the right time for you to start unpacking

163
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,740
 all of your past romantic history?

164
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,940
 When does that happen?

165
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,460
 You see, there's a lot of debate that can happen here.

166
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,820
 But when it comes to those areas

167
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,180
 of our romantic relationships,

168
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,960
 we know that in the spots where we've gone too far,

169
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,960
 we often feel that there's not much to discuss.

170
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,600
 We're pretty conclusively convinced

171
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,960
 when those moments come.

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,500
 And the reason we are is because

173
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,280
 they're associated with negative feelings,

174
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,560
 things like shame and regret and embarrassment and guilt,

175
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,360
 things that we don't like to feel,

176
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,960
 those moments that feel like a dark cloud

177
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,880
 in the midst of a sunny sky over your romantic relationship.

178
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,960
 We're all familiar with those.

179
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,660
 It's convincing when you've gone too far.

180
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,760
 When you started fooling around

181
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,680
 and maybe you found yourself further physically

182
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
 than you thought you'd ever be,

183
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,600
 or you experimented with the same sex,

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,960
 and at first it was just innocent.

185
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
 But then you found yourself catching feelings

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,480
 in a way that you never actually anticipated happening.

187
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,160
 Maybe you met someone at a really low point in your life,

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,720
 and at that moment, you became so emotionally entangled

189
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,280
 that codependency began to creep in,

190
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,880
 or you slept with one another,

191
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,120
 even though you swore in this relationship,

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,740
 this time it was going to be different.

193
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,500
 You see, the reality is going too far

194
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,860
 is a feeling many of us are very familiar with.

195
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,380
 And it's a feeling that our society

196
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,920
 is very familiar with too,

197
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,260
 which is why we've seen the advent of consent culture,

198
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,040
 this idea where two people,

199
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,280
 so long as they're under a verbal agreement,

200
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,280
 can have emotionless, boundaryless, and commitmentless sex.

201
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,660
 Because in a materialist culture

202
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,500
 like we have here in America,

203
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,220
 you can disassociate what happens to your body

204
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,420
 from what happens to your mind and your soul.

205
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,200
 And yet, according to one author

206
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,560
 and a journalist out of the Washington Post,

207
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,820
 a woman by the name of Christine Imba,

208
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,760
 she argues that couldn't be further from the truth.

209
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,920
 You see, she wrote an article,

210
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,840
 and I would commend it to you.

211
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,580
 It's called "Consent is Not Enough,

212
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,340
 We Need a New Sexual Ethic."

213
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,020
 And in there, she makes the case

214
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,340
 that the primary argument around consent today

215
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,900
 is not what's legally correct,

216
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,180
 but what's ethically correct.

217
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,660
 You see, the debate really revolves around

218
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,660
 not whether we can do X, Y, or Z,

219
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,780
 but whether we should do X, Y, or Z.

220
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,940
 She says this in that article.

221
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,340
 She says, "Making the standard of consent

222
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,800
 "our sole criterion for good sex

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,080
 "punts on the question of how to conduct a relationship

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,620
 "that affirms our fundamental personhood

225
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
 "and our human dignity."

226
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,260
 What's she saying?

227
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,620
 In her estimation,

228
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,440
 it's impossible to separate one's body from their emotions.

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,860
 It's not possible to engage in physical intimacy

230
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,660
 and not develop a emotional connection with someone else.

231
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,820
 And that's a point that her peers within scholarship

232
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,660
 agree on.

233
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
 I could share with you several,

234
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,220
 but I'll just give you one.

235
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,960
 Peggy Ornstein, in her book "Girls and Sex,"

236
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,180
 was doing a variety of interviews on college campuses,

237
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,460
 and as she was talking to young college women,

238
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,260
 she found that they perceived hooking up,

239
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,460
 sober mind you, to be awkward.

240
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,160
 As one freshman girl put it to Peggy,

241
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,200
 she said, "Being sober makes it seem

242
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
 "like you want to be in a relationship.

243
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,140
 "It's really uncomfortable."

244
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,320
 What are those college students saying to Peggy

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,980
 as she's concluding her data?

246
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,980
 They're saying, "I want to experience

247
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,880
 "the physical pleasure of physical intimacy,

248
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,400
 "but I don't want the emotional pain

249
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
 "that comes with a real connection."

250
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,660
 And the same is true for us.

251
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,340
 That's what happens whenever we go too far.

252
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,660
 We don't like the feeling.

253
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,340
 And what the world has done is it's given you two solutions.

254
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,900
 Hey, if you don't like the feeling

255
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
 that you get whenever you go too far,

256
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,180
 whenever you cross boundaries you shouldn't cross,

257
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,140
 whenever you slip into places you know you shouldn't go,

258
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,020
 what you have to support your conscience

259
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,700
 is you can be appeased by way of consent,

260
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,560
 or you can avoid those feelings by way of alcohol,

261
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,640
 neither of which are very good options.

262
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,820
 I think there's a better way.

263
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,580
 You see, rather than regretting going too far,

264
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,040
 what if we just knew how far is too far?

265
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,300
 That's what I want to talk with you about today.

266
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,420
 Like, I want to talk to you about how far is too far,

267
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
 which is a really interesting question

268
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,660
 when you think about it,

269
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,820
 because when people ask this question,

270
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,980
 it may be one inquisition,

271
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,460
 but it's actually two lines of logic.

272
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,740
 People want to know where the line is.

273
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,300
 Tell me, like, where's the line at?

274
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,100
 And then how close to the line can I actually get?

275
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,260
 That's what people really want to know,

276
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,860
 which is a really dumb way of thinking about it.

277
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,100
 Like, why would you want to get as close to the ledge

278
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,140
 as physically possible,

279
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,120
 knowing that one wrong movement

280
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,020
 might lead you slipping over the side

281
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,300
 and falling into your romantic doom?

282
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,020
 Why would you ever want to do that?

283
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,140
 Because it's a thrill?

284
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,720
 Actually, yes.

285
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,980
 That's why many young adults want to know

286
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,500
 where the line is.

287
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 They want to know, that way they can avoid messing up,

288
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,580
 but they can also avoid missing out.

289
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,860
 But here's the thing.

290
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,660
 If you're operating in a romantic context,

291
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,380
 within a dating relationship to someone else,

292
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,260
 with that mentality, I don't want to miss out,

293
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,780
 then the truth is you've already missed out.

294
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,540
 You see, what we know is that contrary

295
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,940
 to what most people think,

296
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,820
 the goal of purity is not just to avoid moving too fast

297
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,240
 or going too far.

298
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,060
 The goal of purity is also, and actually it's more so,

299
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,180
 about seeing God as too good.

300
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,340
 That's really what we want,

301
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,940
 which is why boundaries are really helpful.

302
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
 Now, if we're going to talk about boundaries,

303
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,940
 it's useful to have a common definition

304
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,900
 that we all agree upon when we're talking about this idea.

305
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,540
 And so here's the idea of boundaries.

306
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,460
 A boundary is a line that guards against temptation

307
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,380
 for the sake of personal flourishing.

308
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,420
 It's a line that guards against temptation

309
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,620
 for the sake of personal flourishing.

310
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,740
 And it's often, it's a line that you yourself set.

311
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,820
 You see, many people think of boundaries

312
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
 as trying to box you in.

313
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,060
 But really what boundaries are trying to do

314
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,780
 is they're trying to build you up.

315
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,340
 You see, a fire can both burn down a home

316
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,100
 and bring warmth to a house.

317
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,060
 And the same is true in a dating relationship.

318
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,480
 The difference though depends on the boundary

319
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,820
 that fire is contained within.

320
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,340
 In a dating relationship,

321
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,780
 the two of you can go up in flames.

322
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,620
 You can be burnt by wrong behavior,

323
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,020
 or your relationship can become a source of life.

324
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,180
 It can be a cause for warmth as you date

325
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,180
 in a way that is both befitting of Christ

326
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,820
 and blessing to one another.

327
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,300
 So then it begs the question,

328
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,540
 what kind of boundaries should we have?

329
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,820
 Well, the apostle Paul,

330
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,860
 he really begins to unpack that idea for us

331
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,620
 in 1 Thessalonians chapter four.

332
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,700
 So if you've got a Bible, you can pull it out.

333
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,620
 1 Thessalonians chapter four.

334
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,700
 While you're doing that,

335
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,620
 let me just give you a little bit of brief context.

336
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,260
 Paul is writing to a group of young believers

337
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,580
 in this bustling metropolis known as Thessalonica.

338
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,420
 Thessalonica was a highly diversified

339
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,580
 and a highly sexualized city.

340
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,660
 You see, within its streets,

341
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,220
 things like pagan worship and temple prostitution

342
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,820
 and serial adultery were rampant.

343
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,220
 It was so common for there to be not a one woman man,

344
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,920
 but a many woman man.

345
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,140
 One Athenian order by the name of Demosthenes

346
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,100
 by the name of Demosthenes,

347
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,060
 he articulates this context

348
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,920
 to which we're reading into by saying this,

349
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,760
 this was from his day.

350
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,740
 He said, "We keep prostitutes for pleasure.

351
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,140
 We keep mistresses for the day-to-day needs of the body.

352
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,460
 And we keep wives for the begetting of children

353
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,460
 for the faithful guardianship of our homes."

354
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,700
 You see, what's he saying?

355
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,540
 We live in a Greco Roman society that is sexually charged.

356
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,940
 And it's into that society that the apostle Paul

357
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,180
 is writing to this young community of believers.

358
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
 And he's trying to tell them,

359
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,140
 "Hey, there's a way to order your life

360
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
 so that when you do what is appropriate

361
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,700
 and you avoid what is inappropriate,

362
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,580
 there are boundaries that you should follow."

363
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,460
 And my hope over the course of our time

364
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,260
 is to help you see the same.

365
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,140
 That within our context,

366
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,420
 there's a way to live appropriately,

367
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,980
 to order your life with boundaries

368
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,180
 so that way your relationships can flourish and not fail.

369
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,620
 And the way that I wanna do it

370
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,980
 is I wanna give you four ways

371
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,560
 to know when you've gone too far.

372
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,400
 That's what I wanna do.

373
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,220
 I'm gonna give you four ways

374
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,580
 to know when you've gone too far.

375
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,220
 The first of which we read about in the opening verses.

376
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,060
 And as we do so,

377
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,620
 we're just gonna take verse by verse by verse.

378
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,780
 We'll talk about it a little bit

379
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,300
 until we get to the very end.

380
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,340
 So here it goes.

381
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,180
 First Thessalonians four, starting in verse one.

382
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,080
 He says this, "Finally, then brothers,

383
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,340
 we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus

384
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,580
 that as you receive from us

385
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,700
 that you ought to walk and to please God

386
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,100
 just as you're doing,

387
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,340
 that you do so more and more.

388
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,140
 For you know what instructions we gave you

389
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,760
 through the Lord Jesus."

390
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,340
 So we'll stop right there.

391
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,980
 The first way you know when you've gone too far

392
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,380
 is your Christianity looks compromised.

393
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,740
 That's the first.

394
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,140
 That's how you know you've gone too far.

395
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,500
 It's when your Christianity looks compromised,

396
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 when your behaviors in life

397
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,820
 don't match the beliefs that you claim.

398
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,620
 Which interestingly is not the case for the Thessalonians.

399
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,100
 Like Paul just described them.

400
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,540
 He said, "Hey, we've become convinced of your faith

401
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,620
 by way of not only your words, but your deeds.

402
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,480
 You're not just in the business

403
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,200
 of learning a lot of things about Jesus.

404
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,980
 You are in the business of living those things yourself.

405
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,420
 You want to follow Christ

406
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,340
 in a way where your life looks like his own.

407
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,480
 Why is that?

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,420
 What was the cause for them to have this kind of allegiance?"

409
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,140
 He tells us, "They saw that Jesus was an authority.

410
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,100
 It says that they learned from his instruction."

411
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,180
 So I'll put it to you like this.

412
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,720
 If you were to go to driver's ed

413
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,340
 and a 16 year old was sitting there

414
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,540
 trying to teach you how to drive a car,

415
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,820
 that would not be very good instruction.

416
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,660
 But if you showed up to driver's ed

417
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,460
 and Lewis Hamilton was sitting behind the wheel,

418
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,160
 you better take some notes.

419
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,660
 That guy knows his way.

420
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,100
 He has understood the rules of the road

421
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
 and you will be served well

422
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,620
 to learn the things that he has to teach you.

423
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,620
 You see, the credibility of your teacher

424
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,660
 impacts the quality of your learning.

425
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,220
 These Thessalonians, they're looking at Jesus

426
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,320
 and they're like, "Man, there's no one

427
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,660
 more credible than him.

428
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,260
 He's one that can teach me the things that I know,

429
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,420
 not just for some things in life,

430
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,820
 but for everything in life,

431
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,620
 even the areas in which I engage romantically

432
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,660
 with other people.

433
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,820
 He's my authority."

434
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,460
 And so I listen to him.

435
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,840
 "Poarch, let me ask you,

436
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,580
 when it comes to dating and relationships,

437
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,760
 who's your authority?

438
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,100
 Who are you learning from?

439
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,940
 Like whose instruction are you sitting underneath?

440
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,340
 Who is it that's discipling you

441
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
 when it comes to the realm of romance?

442
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,900
 Is it your buddies?

443
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,220
 The way that they talk about women?

444
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,540
 Maybe it's your girlfriends.

445
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,900
 Could be TikTok, significant other.

446
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,860
 Maybe it's none of those.

447
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,060
 Maybe it's your favorite romanticy author,

448
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,500
 Sarah J. Moss, Rebecca Yarrows.

449
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,380
 Maybe it's a podcast that you listen to,

450
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,100
 something on YouTube, like whatever,

451
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,060
 or call her daddy on Spotify.

452
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,540
 I don't know what it is, but there's a good chance

453
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,460
 you're subscribing to someone else's authority.

454
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,420
 And the issue is when you start to do that,

455
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,900
 what happens is you start to go too far.

456
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,700
 You see, why is it that our Christianity

457
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,900
 becomes compromised?

458
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,700
 Our Christianity becomes compromised

459
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,620
 when we stop listening to God

460
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,580
 and we start listening to other people.

461
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,780
 It doesn't even mean that they're bad people.

462
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,220
 It doesn't mean that they have an evil agenda,

463
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,660
 but there's a difference in listening to good teachers

464
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
 and listening to a godly teacher.

465
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,180
 And Jesus wants to teach you the ways of God himself.

466
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,380
 He wants to spare you from a Christianity

467
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,180
 that looks compromised.

468
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,900
 So how is it that our Christianity can look compromised?

469
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,020
 Well, I wanna share with you a couple of different examples

470
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,260
 because what I know is this is not just pertinent

471
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,480
 to physical compromise, though that's true.

472
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,260
 You see, when our Christianity becomes compromised,

473
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,140
 we know that we have encroached a boundary

474
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,500
 in not only physical places,

475
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,900
 but emotional places and spiritual places too.

476
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,820
 And so your Christianity,

477
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,900
 it can look compromised physically for sure.

478
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,080
 I talk to people all the time and they look at me

479
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,920
 and they say things like,

480
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,980
 "Well, how else are you supposed to know it's going to work

481
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,180
 "unless you move in with each other?"

482
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,420
 Look, I'll tell you how you know it's gonna work.

483
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,940
 Your relationship's gonna work

484
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,200
 because you're committed to making it work.

485
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,860
 You do not have to cohabit in order to figure out

486
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,940
 whether or not we're a compatible couple.

487
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,340
 In fact, if you look at the data,

488
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,780
 what you realize is cohabiting

489
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,300
 is not a determiner of marriage material.

490
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,100
 It might actually be one that exposes the opposite.

491
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,140
 According to the research,

492
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,580
 cohabiting increases the likelihood of divorce,

493
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,820
 it decreases overall marital satisfaction,

494
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,020
 and it's directly linked to negative psychological

495
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,120
 and emotional outcomes for children.

496
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,940
 Meaning a relationship does not last in your life

497
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,300
 because, "Oh my gosh, he's house trained.

498
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,700
 "I never would've thought he picks up after himself."

499
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,660
 That's not why it's gonna last.

500
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,740
 It's not gonna work because,

501
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,900
 "Dude, she loves to cook and I love to eat."

502
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,860
 That's not why it's gonna work out.

503
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,940
 You're not looking for a roommate,

504
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,400
 you're looking for a spouse.

505
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,860
 Now, let me be abundantly clear,

506
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
 these aren't bad things to look for.

507
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,980
 And when you get married and you rightly enter a home

508
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,560
 under the proper covenantal union that God has established,

509
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,740
 man and wife, you should work through some of these details.

510
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,580
 You don't want your home to feel like

511
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,380
 a never-ending season of survivor

512
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,100
 where you're constantly fighting for your life

513
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,060
 with this other person on the same island.

514
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,380
 That's not what you want.

515
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,620
 But you need to make sure

516
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,020
 that you're valuing the right things first,

517
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,220
 that you're looking at them and you're trying to discern,

518
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
 "Are you someone that I can build a life with

519
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,580
 without pretending we're already

520
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,740
 in that life together right now?"

521
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,780
 You need to look at them and you need to see in them Jesus,

522
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,920
 someone that will serve you even at cost to themself,

523
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,780
 that will seek your good because they care about you,

524
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,220
 that will sacrifice because they want your wellbeing.

525
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,300
 You want someone that looks like Jesus.

526
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,800
 If you find someone like that, I promise you'll work it out.

527
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,580
 But how do we know if we're sexually compatible?

528
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,480
 (congregation laughing)

529
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,580
 What do you mean?

530
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,780
 Like, are you a guy?

531
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,880
 Is she a girl?

532
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,560
 It's gonna work.

533
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,660
 (congregation laughing)

534
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,640
 We're laughing, but this is the gray question

535
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,720
 facing our culture.

536
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
 We so often look at one another and we wonder,

537
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
 "But hold on, I've got to know

538
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,280
 that there's good sexual chemistry here."

539
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
 Oh, so what you're talking about

540
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,800
 is you're not wondering if your parts fit

541
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
 'cause your parts will.

542
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,680
 What you're actually wondering is,

543
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,280
 can he strike the right positions

544
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,600
 or do they know the proper technique?

545
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,840
 That's really what you wanna know.

546
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,400
 Is this thing going to be good for me?

547
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
 And that is selfish.

548
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,960
 That's so selfish.

549
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,600
 That's not valuing the life of another person,

550
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,080
 that is valuing your life in their place instead.

551
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,200
 And here's what I want you to know.

552
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
 You're not supposed to know if you have sexual chemistry

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,900
 or compatibility before you get married.

554
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,880
 That's why you get married.

555
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,000
 You spend the first few years of your marriage

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,280
 figuring this out together.

557
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
 Like that's the beauty of marriage.

558
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,520
 Like sex is meant to be explored

559
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,240
 between a husband and a wife,

560
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,200
 not experimented with other people before you ever get there.

561
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,020
 I love it.

562
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,160
 In the book of Song of Solomon,

563
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
 which I'm committed to teaching at some point

564
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
 here at the porch,

565
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,720
 what I love is you get to chapter four

566
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,960
 and you see Solomon and the Shulamite on their wedding night.

567
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,580
 And as you enter the bridal chamber with the both of them,

568
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,300
 what you see is Solomon admire his bride's beauty.

569
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,620
 He explores her body

570
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,540
 and he does so in a way that dignifies her.

571
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,540
 It says that he starts with her eyes behind her veil.

572
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,540
 And then he moves and he looks at the way

573
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,140
 her hair falls over her shoulders.

574
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,300
 He sees the whiteness of her smile.

575
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,280
 He describes the scarlet redness of her lips.

576
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,440
 He sees the blush in her cheeks.

577
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,640
 He sees the dignity in her neck.

578
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,520
 And I'll stop there because he gets pretty steamy

579
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,220
 as he continues to make his way down.

580
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,040
 You see, what you have to know

581
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,700
 is that sex is meant to be explored.

582
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,120
 Solomon, he didn't enter into that bridal chamber

583
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,880
 wondering, are we sexually compatible?

584
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,040
 Let me tell you how he figured it out.

585
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,980
 He took one look at her and he said,

586
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,000
 I think this is gonna work.

587
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,740
 The same will be true for you.

588
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,920
 So you will compromise your Christianity physically

589
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,300
 if you fall prey to some line of question like this,

590
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,940
 but you'll also, you'll compromise your Christianity

591
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,060
 emotionally if you fall prey to questions like,

592
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,260
 well, how do I lead my girlfriend?

593
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,860
 What are you talking about?

594
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,780
 That is a ridiculous question.

595
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,340
 Now, I know most guys that ask that question

596
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,860
 are not trying to be ridiculous.

597
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,980
 They're trying to be noble.

598
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,540
 They want to do well at the job.

599
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,100
 And yet the truth is, though the Bible has a lot to say

600
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,480
 about the way that men sacrificially love

601
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,660
 and lead their wives and provide for their homes,

602
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,420
 it doesn't say a lick about the way boyfriends

603
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,060
 are supposed to lead their girlfriends.

604
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,260
 And so here's the truth.

605
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,000
 Stop trying to lead her like she's yours

606
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,660
 when you haven't done what it takes to make her yours.

607
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,100
 Like when Brooke and I were dating,

608
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,280
 there came a moment in our relationship

609
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,140
 after we'd been together for a considerable time.

610
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,540
 And at the end of that, and after that time,

611
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,580
 there came a moment where she was getting

612
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,860
 different job opportunities in different cities.

613
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,460
 And it looked like the severing of our relationship

614
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
 was at hand.

615
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,820
 And yet I looked at her and I said,

616
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,200
 hey, I know we've talked about this,

617
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,620
 but you don't belong to me.

618
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,100
 You're not mine.

619
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,160
 We're not married.

620
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,460
 You follow God.

621
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,620
 He's the leader of your life.

622
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,260
 And I trust that he's going to work this thing out

623
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,660
 if he wants it to be.

624
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,780
 He leads my life.

625
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
 He leads your life.

626
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,820
 And the same is true for you.

627
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,700
 God is the leader of your life.

628
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,540
 Yes, some of those things change

629
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,500
 whenever you enter into the marriage union,

630
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,520
 but only then do you start to see leadership roles shift.

631
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,740
 But for now, you lead you and she leads her.

632
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,420
 I could get into the whole point of,

633
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,620
 well, aren't I supposed to guard her heart?

634
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,700
 No, you're not supposed to guard her heart.

635
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,780
 She's supposed to guard her heart.

636
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,060
 That's her job.

637
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,460
 You're supposed to guard your heart.

638
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,220
 You think about yourselves as you think about one another.

639
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,060
 That's the way this thing works.

640
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,560
 And then you compromise your Christianity,

641
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,220
 spiritually speaking,

642
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,900
 whenever you find yourself in spots

643
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,120
 where you're trying to get your significant other

644
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,820
 to be a part of church or Christianity alongside you.

645
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,420
 I get this question all the time.

646
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,380
 I'll sit down, I'll stand up here,

647
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,220
 and people will come talk to me,

648
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,040
 and they'll be like,

649
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
 how do I get my boyfriend to come to church with me?

650
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,640
 How do you get them to?

651
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,580
 You shouldn't have to.

652
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,900
 Like the Bible is very clear.

653
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,100
 2 Corinthians 6, 14 tells us,

654
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,660
 do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.

655
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,780
 For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness,

656
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,920
 or what fellowship has light with darkness?

657
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,780
 You see, your partner should love God

658
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,560
 before you ever enter the picture,

659
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,060
 not because you entered the picture.

660
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,540
 But they're such a nice guy.

661
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,380
 That's great.

662
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,420
 Send them a thank you card.

663
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,460
 You're not looking for a good person.

664
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,420
 You're looking for a godly person.

665
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,740
 That's what you're after.

666
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,780
 You want to link up with someone where,

667
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,500
 as my friend and the director of discipleship

668
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,460
 here at the porch says, Tyler Moffat,

669
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,140
 your of courses match their of courses.

670
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,500
 That's what you want.

671
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,180
 And their of courses need to match yours

672
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,020
 on the biggest issue in the cosmos,

673
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,980
 which is what do you do with the person of Jesus?

674
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,780
 You need to agree about the claims of Christ.

675
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,420
 Now, I could go on, but the bottom line here is,

676
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,980
 if you feel like you're bending your Christian integrity,

677
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,260
 or you're suppressing your spirituality

678
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,540
 just to be with someone,

679
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,220
 then you've gone too far.

680
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,580
 Jesus never compromised.

681
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,500
 He never compromised when he came for us.

682
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,300
 He was faithful to you in the past, in the present,

683
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,740
 and he will be for all time.

684
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,900
 And so you don't compromise yourself for someone else.

685
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,140
 He's shown you the way to love, so you follow his way.

686
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,420
 And the second we pick up is in verses three through five.

687
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,580
 It says this, "For this is the will of God,

688
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,100
 "your sanctification,

689
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,020
 "that you abstain from sexual immorality,

690
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,260
 "that each one of you know how to control his own body

691
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,600
 "in holiness and honor,

692
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,440
 "not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles

693
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,520
 "who do not know God."

694
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,580
 So the second way you know you've gone too far

695
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,680
 is if your behavior becomes disrespectful,

696
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,460
 is if your behavior becomes disrespectful.

697
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,360
 It's interesting.

698
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,360
 Paul tells us very clearly what God's will is for your life.

699
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,140
 If you've ever wondered, here it is.

700
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,980
 He tells you.

701
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,980
 And it's not first and foremost studying the scripture.

702
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,260
 It's not first and foremost serving the poor.

703
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,500
 It's not first and foremost sharing the gospel.

704
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 And it's not first and foremost seeking the lost.

705
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,440
 He tells you the will of God for your life

706
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
 is your sanctification,

707
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,680
 and that comes by way of abstaining from sexual immorality,

708
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,320
 which is interesting, right?

709
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,560
 No one would have guessed.

710
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 So what is it about abstaining from sexual immorality

711
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,200
 that particularly looks like Jesus?

712
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
 Well, Paul tells us.

713
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,800
 He says that when we abstain from sexual immorality,

714
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,620
 it teaches us how to control our bodies

715
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,160
 in holiness and honor,

716
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,780
 in a way that considers God

717
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,500
 and in a way that considers others.

718
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,740
 I think Ben Stewart put this most profoundly.

719
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,300
 He said that we conduct our lives in a way that reflects God

720
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,500
 and it respects others.

721
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,980
 That's the idea that Paul's getting at here.

722
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,220
 But when we don't, that's when we've gone too far.

723
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,580
 That's when we become lost in the passion of lust,

724
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,980
 which is what Paul says here,

725
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,460
 which is a pretty intense idea.

726
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,460
 Like no one wants to be lost in the passion of lust,

727
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,720
 and yet the truth is this often happens to us

728
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,880
 more frequently than we care to admit.

729
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,920
 And the reason for that is because we don't take abstaining

730
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,800
 from sexual immorality as seriously as we should.

731
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,040
 That idea for abstaining,

732
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,420
 it can also be interpreted as fleeing,

733
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,040
 meaning that you're trying to create

734
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,960
 as much distance as humanly possible,

735
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,520
 as fast as humanly possible

736
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,360
 between yourself and the object of your dread.

737
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,820
 So hypothetically, if you're fleeing the scene of a crime,

738
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,720
 you're not sticking around to shake hands and kiss babies.

739
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,560
 You're not trying to see,

740
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
 "Hey, who's really working up the case?"

741
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
 No, you're hitting the road.

742
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,120
 Like you're getting out as fast as possible.

743
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,080
 You're running for the hills.

744
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,920
 Why?

745
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,360
 Because there are consequences to your actions

746
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,960
 and you don't want them to come to bear.

747
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,480
 You flee the scene as fast as possible.

748
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,720
 If we don't flee sexual immorality,

749
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,520
 there are consequences too.

750
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,720
 And we will pay them if we're not careful.

751
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,820
 First Peter 2 11 says, "Beloved, I urge you

752
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,920
 as sojourners and exiles, people that are not of this world,

753
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,340
 but people of a different world,

754
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,940
 to abstain from the passions of the flesh,

755
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,000
 which wage war against your soul."

756
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,860
 You see, Peter's saying, "Hey, your soul is under attack.

757
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,040
 And so you should flee sexual immorality.

758
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,420
 You should create as much distance from it as possible."

759
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,860
 And yet here's the thing,

760
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,220
 rather than flee sexual immorality,

761
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,720
 we often just choose to flirt with it.

762
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
 That's what we do.

763
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,920
 We often find ourselves not fleeing, but flirting.

764
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,700
 Like we watch porn,

765
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,480
 even though we know Pornhub profits

766
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,080
 off of filming rape and sexual assault

767
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,420
 and child sex trafficking.

768
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,280
 Or we indulge sexting,

769
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,880
 not because I'm actually romantically interested

770
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,760
 in that person, but just because it feels good to be wanted.

771
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,960
 Or we find ourselves listening to erotic romance

772
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
 on audio book.

773
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,500
 And the reason for it is because I could read it,

774
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,940
 but man, it's so much better to hear not one,

775
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,420
 but two voice actors tell every spicy detail to one another

776
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,660
 and let my imagination run wild.

777
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,320
 Or it's the fact that we'll hit up OnlyFans.

778
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,100
 And we have no consideration

779
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,700
 for the cycle of sexual solicitation

780
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,200
 those girls are trapped within,

781
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,340
 just because it helps us to scratch the itch and get off.

782
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,240
 You see, even though we don't go as far as we could,

783
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,040
 we so often go further than we should.

784
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,140
 And the reason why is because

785
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,480
 we're like my roommate who never cleaned his room.

786
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,400
 Like, sure, we'll tidy the place up a bit.

787
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,720
 We'll hang up our clothes, put our shoes away,

788
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,080
 make sure our towels hung up and drying.

789
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,600
 We will give the appearance of cleanliness.

790
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,920
 But deep down, if you peel through the layers,

791
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,000
 what you'll actually find is filth.

792
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,120
 This is too often what we do when we don't flee,

793
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,380
 but we flirt with sexual immorality.

794
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,780
 And the thing is, this is not just talking to us

795
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,040
 about the ways that we're sexually deviant or disrespectful.

796
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,500
 It also, it has something to say about the way

797
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,000
 that we're emotionally deviant or disrespectful,

798
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,320
 something that's rampant in our day.

799
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 So ladies, that little voice in your head

800
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,040
 that makes you question everything he does,

801
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,080
 or it assumes nothing is ever right,

802
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,940
 or it interprets every minor move

803
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,780
 as a major declaration of love

804
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,200
 that is not honoring to your man.

805
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,780
 When he looks at you and he says,

806
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,640
 "Hey, I'm sorry, I'd love to, but I'm busy tonight.

807
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,920
 "How about tomorrow?"

808
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,040
 It is respectful to take him at his word

809
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,460
 and not infer something that isn't true.

810
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,340
 Well, who's he gonna see then?

811
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,140
 Is it that girl that he was talking to at the coffee shop,

812
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,600
 that redhead that stood up from the rest of the crowd?

813
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,820
 Maybe it's not who he's seeing.

814
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,300
 Maybe he's not seeing anyone.

815
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,700
 Maybe he doesn't wanna be with me.

816
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,820
 Maybe I did something.

817
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,660
 What did I do?

818
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,060
 Did I come across too clingy?

819
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,900
 Like, was it the fact that I wanted to see him on Thursday,

820
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,340
 even though we had plans on Friday?

821
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,840
 Maybe it's not something that he's going to see.

822
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,900
 Maybe it's not something that I did.

823
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,740
 Maybe it's no one.

824
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,560
 Maybe it's nothing.

825
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,420
 Maybe he just wants to chill and he can't chill with me.

826
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,380
 But I'm chill.

827
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,500
 I'm so chill.

828
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,540
 I'll chill all night.

829
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,860
 I'll eat an entire gallon of ice cream

830
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,300
 'cause I'm that kind of chill.

831
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,260
 I'll prove him.

832
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,100
 Maybe it's none of that.

833
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,340
 Maybe he just means what he's saying.

834
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,420
 Maybe he's just telling you, I'd love to, I can't.

835
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,700
 How about tomorrow?

836
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,380
 It's honorable to take him at his word

837
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
 and not assume something else.

838
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,980
 You see, you know you've gone too far

839
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,420
 when your behavior becomes disrespectful.

840
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,940
 And so here's what we have to do, Porch.

841
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,060
 We have to take control of our bodies.

842
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,700
 We have to take captive our thoughts.

843
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,060
 We have to subdue our flesh.

844
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,620
 And the reason we do is Jesus did all of that for us.

845
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,060
 Jesus controlled his own body.

846
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,060
 He took captive his own thoughts.

847
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,180
 He subdued, mastered his flesh for you.

848
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,260
 And so we should do so for him and for other people too.

849
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,100
 Paul keeps going.

850
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,000
 He says in verses six and seven,

851
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,420
 "See to it that no one transgresses

852
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,360
 "or wrongs his brother in this matter,

853
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,860
 "because the Lord is an avenger in all these things.

854
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,420
 "As we told you before and we solemnly warned you."

855
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,100
 For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.

856
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,300
 You see, the third way we know we've gone too far

857
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,100
 is when your partner feels violated.

858
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,900
 The third way you know you've gone too far

859
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,020
 is when your partner feels violated.

860
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,460
 That's what Paul means when he says,

861
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,160
 "We should not transgress

862
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,260
 "or we should not wrong our brother or our sister."

863
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,300
 It's the same idea of we should not overstep

864
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,100
 and we should not overreach into someone's life.

865
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,240
 Overstep, it's the idea of going someplace you don't belong.

866
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,060
 So if you trespass on private property, you're overstepping.

867
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,900
 And overreaching is the idea of taking from someone

868
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,940
 something that does not belong to you.

869
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,780
 My son does this all the time.

870
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,840
 We sit next to each other at dinner every night.

871
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,680
 And for whatever reason,

872
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,700
 he likes what's on my plate more than his.

873
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,340
 And so he's constantly just reaching,

874
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,100
 just wants to get, he'll kick, squirm, fuss

875
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
 until he gets hold of what I have.

876
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
 And yet he can never reach it.

877
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,260
 Why? Because it's not his.

878
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,620
 It's not within his grasp.

879
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,220
 If it was his, I would put it within his reach, but it isn't.

880
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,160
 And yet he will overreach trying to get what is not his.

881
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,980
 And we will do the same thing in dating.

882
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,140
 See, Paul is making a case that we hurt people

883
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,040
 whenever we overstep and whenever we overreach.

884
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,600
 Like there's a whole volume of violation

885
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,080
 whenever we go against the will of another person

886
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,960
 and we try to take from them what isn't ours

887
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,000
 and we try to go someplace that isn't ours to go.

888
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
 That's why boundaries are important.

889
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,980
 And it's why boundaries are a really good prover

890
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,280
 of romantic potential partnerships.

891
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,520
 Henry Cloud says it like this.

892
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,780
 He says in his book, "Boundaries,"

893
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,400
 "We can't manipulate people into swallowing our boundaries

894
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,860
 by sugarcoating them."

895
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,680
 No, boundaries, they're a litmus test

896
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
 for the quality of our relationship.

897
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,060
 Those people in our lives who can respect our boundary,

898
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,880
 they'll love our wills, our opinions, our separateness.

899
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,500
 But those who can't respect our boundaries

900
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,920
 are telling us that they don't love our nos.

901
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,760
 They only love our yeses, our compliance.

902
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,260
 I only like it when you do what I want.

903
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,660
 In other words, bad partnerships are characterized

904
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,620
 by overstepping and overreaching.

905
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,340
 And this is a really rampant issue in our culture

906
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,800
 where people take what isn't theirs

907
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,320
 and they go someplace that isn't theirs.

908
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's rampant in our day.

909
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,600
 I could have pulled out so many different examples.

910
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,440
 I had a bunch.

911
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,040
 I had to strip those away because time is of the essence.

912
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,760
 And yet I wanted to share one of them with you

913
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 because I just thought it was startling.

914
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 According to Pew Research,

915
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,840
 56% of women under the age of 50,

916
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,040
 which covers everyone in this room,

917
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,880
 report having been sent unwanted

918
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,920
 sexually explicit images or messages.

919
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,800
 Unwanted.

920
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,600
 84% of college-aged women, that being 18 to 22,

921
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,160
 claim to have received the same thing,

922
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,200
 unwanted sexually explicit images or messages

923
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
 from strangers online.

924
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,280
 That is startling, isn't it?

925
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,000
 It's startling because that covers far beyond

926
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,880
 more than half of the women in this room.

927
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,080
 That's been your experience, ladies.

928
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,640
 But it's also startling because this has been unwanted

929
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,580
 and it is totally unwarranted.

930
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,560
 And the crazy thing about it is,

931
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,680
 while I know in our current liberated sexual day,

932
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,520
 every solicitor in this moment of these images or messages

933
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,920
 is not necessarily a male, but by and large,

934
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,120
 this is typically characterized of the male population.

935
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,880
 Those whom God has dignified with the purpose

936
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,680
 of providing and protecting his daughters.

937
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,320
 Not preying upon and propositioning them

938
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,480
 for their own benefit.

939
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,320
 We live in a day where we overstep and we overreach.

940
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,920
 It's more common in our culture than we often realize.

941
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,840
 So how do you know when it's happening

942
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,020
 in your relationship?

943
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,340
 Well, I'm gonna give you four categories to consider.

944
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,940
 I could rush these, but I think that these are important.

945
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,920
 So I wanna take our time

946
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,400
 'cause I wanna make sure you hear 'em.

947
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,240
 The first thing you know if someone's violating you

948
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,000
 in your relationship is they're pressuring you sexually.

949
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,540
 They're pressuring you sexually.

950
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,160
 Like if someone in your relationship

951
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,840
 is constantly guilting you to do more.

952
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,240
 I've got sexual needs, baby.

953
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,560
 Like I need you to help me out with these things.

954
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,920
 What they're proving to you

955
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,280
 is that they don't need more of you,

956
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,720
 they need less of you.

957
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,480
 If there's someone in your relationship

958
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,760
 that's always asking for another picture.

959
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,860
 Like it's not like we're having sex.

960
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,960
 Like we're just kind of fooling around a little bit.

961
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,520
 We're just messing with one another.

962
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,360
 What they're proving to you

963
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,840
 is that they can make excuses for their sins

964
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,520
 and they cannot find solutions for their godliness.

965
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 If they're always insisting,

966
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,060
 hey, like you should come stay the night.

967
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,900
 Like we're not gonna do anything.

968
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,600
 We're just gonna sleep right next to each other.

969
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,720
 That person is deceiving you.

970
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,840
 They don't wanna sleep next to you.

971
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,280
 If they do, you've got a different problem on your hands.

972
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,080
 You've gotta be careful.

973
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,160
 Hebrews 13, verse four says,

974
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,920
 "Let marriage be held in honor among all,

975
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,720
 "and let the marriage bed be undefiled,

976
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,440
 "for God will judge the sexually immoral

977
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,080
 "and the adulterous."

978
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,160
 You know what that tells you

979
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,580
 if you're being pressured sexually?

980
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,600
 That verse tells you that your partner does not fear God.

981
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,300
 Because what we know is sexual immorality and adultery,

982
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,620
 it is judged by God.

983
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,460
 Now, to be very clear, it is forgiven by Christ.

984
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,180
 But we do not sin all the more that grace may abound.

985
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,740
 That's not why we do it.

986
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,960
 No, we relish in the free gift of grace

987
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,700
 that Jesus gives to those who are genuinely repentant,

988
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,020
 not just remorseful.

989
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,180
 You want someone who is not trying to defile you,

990
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,060
 but honor you.

991
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,740
 Someone that will look at you and say,

992
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,100
 "Hey, you're with me for now,

993
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,020
 "but I don't know how long we'll have,

994
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,900
 "but you will be with someone forever,

995
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,460
 "and I want to honor them as well as you.

996
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,840
 "I want to set you up for success."

997
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,420
 The next way you know if someone's violating

998
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,300
 in your relationship is they're demeaning you verbally.

999
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,460
 They're demeaning you verbally.

1000
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,820
 So listen, ladies, if he's belittling your body,

1001
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,940
 if he is constantly comparing you physically,

1002
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,680
 if he's tearing down your confidence,

1003
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,860
 then get away from him.

1004
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,420
 Because if he's quick to judge you on the externals,

1005
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,300
 then he won't be slow to judge you on the internals

1006
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,220
 whenever they become known.

1007
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,500
 Guys, you need to know if your girl is quick to critique you.

1008
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,820
 Like if you bring her flowers and she mocks you

1009
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,500
 because you got her daisies and those are so cheap,

1010
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,540
 or if she chooses to make a joke

1011
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,480
 about some romantic advance you make,

1012
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,240
 you wrote her poetry, you planned a date,

1013
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,380
 you came with questions,

1014
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,820
 and she thinks this is so cheesy or cliche,

1015
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,320
 then get away from that.

1016
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,180
 You don't want someone that's going to critique you.

1017
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,340
 You want a woman that is going to celebrate your effort,

1018
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,260
 not criticize your results.

1019
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,980
 I love this.

1020
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,500
 Proverbs 26, 24, 25,

1021
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,900
 it tells us about the dangers of emotionally oversharing.

1022
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,860
 That situation where some woman shares with you

1023
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,180
 the deepest longings in her heart,

1024
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,580
 even though she has no business in giving you her heart,

1025
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,540
 this is what Proverbs 26, 24, 25 would say.

1026
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,040
 It says, "Enemies disguise themselves with their lips,

1027
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,660
 "but in their hearts they harbor deceit.

1028
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,820
 "Through their speech, though their speech is charming,

1029
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,100
 "do not believe them."

1030
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,820
 You see, I have seen so many couples suffer

1031
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,540
 under unnecessary emotional manipulation

1032
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,140
 because there's this deep fear

1033
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,620
 that this is the best it's ever going to get.

1034
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,380
 So I'm willing, I will silently suffer

1035
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,620
 so long as it keeps us together.

1036
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,420
 And yet what happens in that situation

1037
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,580
 is you don't walk into a thriving, healthy relationship,

1038
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,620
 instead you fall down into a toxic one.

1039
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,720
 Do not allow for that.

1040
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,620
 You deserve more.

1041
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,080
 Christ, he has died and risen so that you might have it.

1042
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,020
 The next thing you need to know

1043
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,700
 is they may be controlling you physically.

1044
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,660
 They may be controlling you physically.

1045
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,140
 Like if you're just dating,

1046
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,020
 and that person, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,

1047
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,380
 gets mad because,

1048
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,200
 well, we're supposed to spend the weekends together.

1049
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,620
 Again, we've talked about this.

1050
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,580
 You don't belong to them.

1051
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,220
 Like they have no right to get frustrated

1052
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,420
 unless you made a commitment

1053
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,900
 and now you're going against it.

1054
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,340
 They have no reason to be frustrated with you.

1055
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,060
 Instead, they need to look at you

1056
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,900
 and they need to honor the fact

1057
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,460
 there's separation between the two of you.

1058
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,540
 You have genuine autonomy.

1059
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,580
 You're independent persons.

1060
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,580
 And yet I have seen both guys and girls

1061
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,380
 do things like track their boyfriend

1062
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,880
 or girlfriend's location,

1063
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,600
 monitor their transaction history,

1064
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,740
 share their social media

1065
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,120
 because they want to know who they're talking to

1066
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,640
 and when they're talking to them.

1067
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,580
 They're controlling them physically.

1068
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,140
 And if someone's doing that in your life,

1069
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,080
 you need to run.

1070
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,160
 You got to get away from that.

1071
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,540
 That's not safe.

1072
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,100
 Like, listen, Jesus is not someone

1073
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,140
 that confirms that kind of control in your life,

1074
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,640
 though people have used his name to substantiate such.

1075
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,320
 Jesus is not someone that will side with that person

1076
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,400
 and say, yeah, my word authorizes all of this.

1077
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,040
 No, Jesus's word does not authorize any of this.

1078
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,840
 Jesus, he lives to uplift people,

1079
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,400
 to bring them into a place of flourishing.

1080
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,560
 And yet often those that try to physically control us

1081
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,280
 have other things in mind.

1082
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,900
 And then the last one is

1083
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,440
 they're manipulating you emotionally.

1084
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,920
 I mentioned the way that she or he

1085
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,080
 may emotionally overshare in the hope

1086
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,280
 of reeling you in that they have no intent.

1087
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,760
 And yet you also need to know that there are people

1088
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,940
 that will always try to make things seem like your fault.

1089
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,840
 They'll try to invalidate your feelings.

1090
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,640
 They'll never take ownership when conflict arises.

1091
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,040
 They will constantly question your judgment

1092
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,060
 rather than seeking to understand.

1093
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,360
 And you should be careful of them.

1094
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,400
 I need to keep going, but here's the point.

1095
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,680
 God has called us to holiness.

1096
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,960
 And because he has, we don't go where we don't belong

1097
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,400
 and we don't take what isn't ours.

1098
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,480
 We do the opposite.

1099
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,520
 We go where Jesus went.

1100
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,360
 Where did Jesus go?

1101
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,520
 He moved towards his beloved.

1102
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,240
 And then we do what Jesus did.

1103
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,160
 He didn't take, he gave.

1104
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,400
 We're willing to give of ourselves

1105
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,440
 that our boyfriend, our girlfriend,

1106
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,840
 and eventually our husbands and our wives might have life.

1107
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,360
 That's the thought here.

1108
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,880
 And the very last thing you need to see

1109
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,560
 is in verse eight, and we'll go quick.

1110
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,280
 It says this, "Therefore, whoever disregards this

1111
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,940
 disregards not man, but God,

1112
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,320
 who gives his Holy Spirit to you.

1113
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,980
 The fourth way you know you've gone too far

1114
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,520
 is if your conscience has grown cold."

1115
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,020
 If your conscience grows cold.

1116
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,000
 That's what Paul says in the final verses of this section.

1117
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,680
 He looks at the Thessalonians and he says,

1118
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
 "Hey, there's one more final issue.

1119
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,560
 There's one more final warning I need to issue you

1120
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,160
 when it comes to your romantic relationships."

1121
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,560
 He says, "If you disregard any of the above,

1122
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,960
 any of the other three things that we've talked about,

1123
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,400
 then you not only disregard God,

1124
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,040
 you not only disregard man, you disregard God.

1125
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,320
 And the only way that happens in your life

1126
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,600
 and in your dating is when your conscience has grown cold."

1127
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,820
 Hear me on this.

1128
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,560
 Because this is certainly some of you.

1129
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,760
 Some of you are in a relationship tonight

1130
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,320
 where at some point in the past,

1131
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,780
 you knew you'd gone too far.

1132
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,160
 I don't know what it was,

1133
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,680
 and I don't know how long ago it may have been,

1134
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,400
 but you know we went too far at that point back then.

1135
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,680
 And now you just feel like it's too late

1136
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,480
 to do anything about it.

1137
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,320
 It just doesn't matter what point is there.

1138
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,120
 Like you've been sleeping together for so long now,

1139
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,200
 it just feels normal or pornography.

1140
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,960
 It's been his addiction,

1141
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,520
 and he's brought that into a relationship.

1142
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,600
 And though I've begged him to get over it,

1143
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,400
 he's never going to get over it.

1144
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,920
 Or you've seen, man, she's cheated,

1145
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,720
 but I just, I don't know that I can do any better.

1146
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,080
 And when we're together, it's good.

1147
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,920
 But even if she goes unfaithful

1148
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,200
 and she does things with other guys,

1149
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,880
 I'm not willing to give up on this.

1150
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,120
 Or maybe it's masturbation.

1151
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,800
 Like you think about that, you're like, you know what?

1152
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,840
 I know that I'm not supposed to,

1153
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,560
 but it's really kind of the lesser of all evils,

1154
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,120
 and I need a sexual outlet.

1155
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,760
 Or maybe you so desperately just need to be needed by a guy.

1156
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,720
 And so you'll do whatever it takes.

1157
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,280
 Like you'll wear as little as possible.

1158
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,200
 You'll do as much as possible,

1159
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,840
 and you will go however far as needed

1160
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,320
 so that way you can get his attention.

1161
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,320
 I don't know what it is for you, but here's the thing.

1162
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,800
 If you're thinking, you know what?

1163
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
 We crossed the line way back then.

1164
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,520
 We're way too far gone now.

1165
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,080
 It just doesn't really matter.

1166
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,800
 It does matter.

1167
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,640
 It matters because you matter.

1168
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,320
 God is looking at you and he's saying,

1169
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,960
 "Hey, it's not just that you've disregarded man.

1170
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,640
 Don't disregard me.

1171
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,440
 I care about you.

1172
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,080
 I want you to keep fighting.

1173
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,000
 I don't want you to give up already.

1174
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 You may feel like you're too far gone, but here's the thing.

1175
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,360
 No one has gone too far that I cannot reach them."

1176
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,680
 That is the gospel.

1177
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,560
 The long arm of God extends to any and every person.

1178
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,880
 No person can outrun his redemption.

1179
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,160
 No person can outpace his pursuits.

1180
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,600
 He is a God that reaches for the very worst of us

1181
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,000
 and even those that feel like we could not go any deeper.

1182
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,040
 And so if you're here and you're thinking,

1183
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,080
 "It just doesn't matter,"

1184
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,840
 you need to know it desperately does

1185
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,920
 because it matters to him.

1186
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,080
 You see, you can't outrun him.

1187
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,440
 Doesn't matter how far you feel gone.

1188
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,040
 He can still go further

1189
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,200
 because when we'd compromised our Christianity,

1190
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,040
 then we know Jesus, he never compromised us.

1191
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,600
 He pursued us anyways.

1192
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,160
 When we disrespected God by way of going astray in our sin,

1193
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,840
 Jesus never lost sight of you.

1194
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,280
 He considered you even still.

1195
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,440
 When sin had absolutely violated you,

1196
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,280
 Jesus stepped in and he rescued you.

1197
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,840
 Not only that, he restored you.

1198
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,240
 Not only that, he redeemed you for all time

1199
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,000
 should you place your faith in him.

1200
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,740
 And when our conscience had grown cold,

1201
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,760
 so cold as dead in the grave,

1202
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,440
 Jesus brought us to life.

1203
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,880
 Jesus looked at us and he made us like himself.

1204
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,260
 He made us alive.

1205
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,520
 And so here's the thing.

1206
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:50,960
 If you want to order your relationship in a way

1207
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,380
 that not only avoids the bad,

1208
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
 but it pursues the good,

1209
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,520
 then you need to look at Jesus

1210
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,720
 who has ordered his relationship to you

1211
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,180
 in a way that absolutely dealt with the bad,

1212
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,680
 but now is advocating for your good.

1213
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,600
 He took your sin and he condemned it on the cross.

1214
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,120
 He bore it in his body, but he rose forth.

1215
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,080
 So then not only would you be forgiven,

1216
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,720
 but you'd have forever should you place your faith in him.

1217
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,680
 Look to Jesus and see one who pursues us,

1218
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,640
 no matter how far we've gone

1219
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,800
 or how far we feel we've fallen.

1220
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,560
 Let me pray that you would.

1221
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,800
 Lord, we love you and we're grateful for tonight

1222
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,720
 and we thank you for this time.

1223
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,120
 I know God, like this talk can feel heavy

1224
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,100
 because even as we're walking through some of these details,

1225
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,100
 there's a weight, not just in the ideas,

1226
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,480
 but in the experiences of them ourselves.

1227
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,200
 We see God in our own lives

1228
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,680
 that we've lived through some of this stuff.

1229
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,680
 And yet God, I pray that what people would hear

1230
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,800
 is not condemnation,

1231
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,920
 for such is not the future of those in Christ.

1232
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,000
 I pray instead, they would hear redemption,

1233
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,060
 that though their past may be checkered,

1234
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,460
 their future can be white as snow.

00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,900
 God, we pray, would you meet with us now?

1236
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,760
 Would you minister to our hearts?

1237
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,240
 Would you call back to mind something we've said

1238
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,760
 that we need to know?

1239
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,000
 And God, would you work in us,

1240
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,780
 not just to be better people, but to become like you.

1241
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,220
 We love you and we're grateful for tonight.

1242
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,480
 It's in your name we pray, amen.
