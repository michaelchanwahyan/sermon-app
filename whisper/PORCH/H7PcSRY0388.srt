 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:36,640
 >> Porch, so great to be with you, man.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,360
 Feels good to be at home.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
 I've been running a bunch of different directions and

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,240
 just a breath of fresh air to worship with you.

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,000
 I was actually worshiping in that last song.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I was like, man, worship is so good.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,240
 Man, I wonder what the speaker's gonna say.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
 And then I was like, wait, hold on.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,520
 Wonder what the message is gonna be.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
 That's what I was thinking.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,960
 But man, so fantastic to be with you.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,320
 If you're tuning in anywhere around the world, Fort Worth, greetings.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,680
 Dallas, greetings.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,480
 Houston, there's a gathering in Houston tonight.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,680
 Glad you guys are gathering around the word with us as well.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
 And if you're driving in your car or live streaming somewhere else,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
 you need to know the Porch is a movement of young adults seeking to change the world

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,960
 for the cause of Christ.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,840
 And if you don't know him and you're here tonight, welcome home.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
 We're so glad you're here.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
 Welcome into our home.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,040
 We'd love for you to make it your home.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
 And we'd love to talk to you more about the one whose name we gather in.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,440
 And so we're continuing this series, Summer on the Mount, as we wind down

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,360
 the greatest sermon ever told, Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
 And as I thought about where we were headed tonight, something happened this week.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
 I had a guys retreat, community guys retreat in Dallas.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,120
 We stayed in Dallas, went and ate barbecue, ate way too much barbecue

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
 down in the Bishop Arts District.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,760
 And so that's just kind of the cool, really cool area of Dallas.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,840
 Anybody here live in Bishop Arts?

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
 Yeah, you're so much cooler than me.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,480
 I know that already about you.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
 That's true.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,520
 And so we went down there with my guys and we kind of ended the night by going to this

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,120
 place, Dude Sweet Chocolate.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,440
 And so they have this just like this place where they make chocolate.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,920
 And we're walking through there, me and my buddies, and we're tasting stuff.

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
 And I taste this truffle that they have there.

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
 I'm just like, that's amazing.

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
 Okay, so that's what heaven will taste like.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
 And so I'm like, I'll take some of that.

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 And then we come up on this thing and I'm like, what's this?

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,240
 And she's like, oh, that's this chocolate bar that we make with this Japanese pepper.

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,480
 We have it imported from Japan.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
 And like, have you heard of ghost pepper?

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
 She's like, oh, it's hotter than that.

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 You know, and it's infused into this.

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
 And so we're just a bunch of guys.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
 Of course, we're going to get that, you know, I mean, we're not going to eat it, but we'll

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
 get it, you know, and so, and then we'll like dare each other or something.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
 So I'm like, oh, I'll take one of those.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,440
 And so then I go home and I put the bag on the counter and I wake up the next day and

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
 I've got two little girls, right?

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
 Presley, who's eight and Finley.

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
 And they see the bag and they're like, daddy, what's in the bag?

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,000
 And I just, I don't even think I'm like, oh, it's, it's some chocolate I bought.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
 And they're like, oh, daddy, can we have some, can we have some?

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
 And I'm like, sure, sure.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,600
 And so I go, you know, and so I just pull it out.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,080
 Right.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
 And, and I go, you know, for the truffle and I just, I open it up and I'm like, you know,

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,280
 good dad.

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
 Oh, I'll open the other side.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
 And I'm like, good dad.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
 And, um, and so let me, yeah, let me, let me get you, you know, it's just,

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
 it's just a little piece of chocolate.

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
 And so I grab it for him and I get a little knife and I cut it up.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,080
 Right.

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
 And I'm like, you know, you guys can each, each have a piece.

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,880
 It's, it's wonderful.

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,320
 It's wonderful.

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,040
 And Finley, my, my middle little girl, she goes, I want that.

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
 And I go, no, you don't want that.

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,640
 I was here.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,120
 Have this.

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,840
 It's wonderful.

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,720
 You're going to love it.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,280
 She's no daddy.

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
 I don't even like dark, dark chocolate.

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
 Ugh.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,480
 I don't know.

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,040
 I don't want that.

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
 I want that.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
 And I go, no, family bear, listen, I promise you, you don't want that.

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
 Have a bite of this one.

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,240
 And Presley, see Presley, she's eight.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,880
 She's been with me eight whole years and she has learned this experiment.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,240
 She knows she's, this is just going to be a sermon illustration of some sort, you know,

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
 she knows.

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
 And so she says, she goes, she goes, daddy, which one do you think I should eat?

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
 And I'm like, baby girl, I'm telling you, you have to have a pie.

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
 It's, it's going to be wonderful.

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,080
 And she doesn't have, you know, she asked me, she pops in her mouth.

97
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
 She's like, oh daddy, that is good.

98
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,300
 Wow.

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,960
 And Finley's still there.

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
 She's like, daddy, I want that one.

101
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,200
 I want that.

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,480
 I want the, I want the bar.

103
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
 I'm a baby girl.

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,740
 Listen.

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,440
 Okay.

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,920
 Here we go.

107
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
 The choice is yours.

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,100
 Okay.

109
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,480
 But I'm telling you, you don't want that bar.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,760
 You want to eat the piece.

111
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
 I'm trying to give you.

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,560
 And she takes it and she opens up, rips into it and she takes a bite.

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
 And at first, you know, it's milk chocolate, sweet.

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,800
 She's, she just kind of looks at me like, it looks at Presley, like we little bitty piece

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
 got my chocolate bar, you know?

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,920
 And then she goes, and she runs, I'm not kidding.

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
 I'm not making this up.

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
 She runs to the sink, turns on the sink and she's like trying to drink from the faucet.

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
 She's like, it's just running.

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
 She's washing.

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
 She's like, it's just so hot.

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
 Listen, man, I'm a good dad.

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,880
 I desire to give you good things.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 You can try.

125
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
 And so what's going on there, right?

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,360
 All of her perception, she sees something she doesn't want.

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
 She sees something she does want.

128
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,360
 She sees something bigger.

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,880
 All of, all of her senses, all of her being, all of her perception is saying, no, I want

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,360
 that.

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,080
 And I'm just sitting there.

132
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,960
 I'm like, no, I know that, that it looks like you do, but you don't.

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,920
 It looks like you do, but you don't.

134
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
 And then the same way, right?

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
 We go through life and we see in the scripture that God is called a loving father and that

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,640
 we're to go to him and we're to ask him, even when it doesn't make sense to us, God, what

137
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,760
 would you have us do?

138
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,880
 God, this doesn't seem good.

139
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,200
 Is that what you would have me do?

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
 God, this seems good.

141
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
 Is this the right one?

142
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,720
 You're saying it's not, but it seems like it is.

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,600
 And some of us, in fact, I've met with many of you who have turned your back on God and

144
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,560
 gone away from him because you feel like he's given you something not good when he's given

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,320
 others something that is good.

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,160
 And you feel like you've been sliding.

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,240
 And you question the goodness of God.

148
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
 And so tonight I just want to talk about praying to a good father.

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,200
 Praying to a good father, say, I think the most unloving thing that you can do to God

150
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
 is question his goodness.

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
 Said otherwise, I think the most unloving thing that you can do to God is question his

152
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
 love for you.

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
 He's gone to great lengths to show his love for you.

154
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,400
 Likewise, I've got three kids and I will tell you as a father, I would rather hear them

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,600
 say, I hate you, dad, than hear them say, I don't think you love me, dad.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,040
 If I had to choose between those two awful expressions, I would choose the one that

157
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,920
 expresses disdain for me rather than the one that questions my love for them.

158
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,960
 And so the reality is God is a good father.

159
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
 He seeks to give you good things.

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
 And if you have something, be it singleness, a breakup, a disease.

161
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 Something unwanted like a pregnancy.

162
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,960
 Something you brought up on your about yourself or something that happened to you.

163
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,600
 I would say, trust him.

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,040
 And steward that suffering, knowing that he's a good father and desires to give good

165
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,200
 things to his children.

166
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,080
 And so when others have left God because they say they don't like what they have in

167
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
 their life, I appreciate their view of his sovereignty.

168
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
 But I question their view of his goodness.

169
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,120
 And so as we move through this section, we're going to be in Matthew chapter seven.

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,440
 If you want to turn there, starting in verse seven, like I said, it's Jesus's sermon on

171
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
 the Mount, where if you read it, the whole entire sermon would take you about 15 minutes.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,040
 But in those 15 minutes, Jesus covers law, grace, missions, adultery, lust, love, hate,

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,280
 judgment, marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor prayer, anxiety, money, materialism,

174
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,480
 heaven and hell in 15 minutes if you read it.

175
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,440
 And so tonight in this little section, verses seven through 12 in chapter seven, we're going

176
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,920
 to look at how we pray, who we pray to and how God might use you to answer prayers.

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,320
 Let's go.

178
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,720
 Jesus says in the sermon, ask he's preaching on this hillside.

179
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,760
 His disciples are there.

180
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,600
 There's people gathering and listening to him as he teaches.

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,200
 Ask and it will be given to you.

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
 Seek and you will find.

183
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
 Knock and the door will be open to you for everyone who asks, receive.

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,320
 And the one who seeks finds into the one who knocks the door will be opened.

185
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
 And so my first point this evening from this text is pray with persistence.

186
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,760
 Pray continually.

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,280
 Pray consistently.

188
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,640
 Pray ongoing.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:25,040
 He's saying, ask, don't just ask, but seek and don't just seek, knock and knock persistently.

190
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,080
 And you say, well, wait a minute.

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
 JP, does it say not persistently?

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
 This is repeated in Luke chapter 11, the same.

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,920
 Passage in right before it, he says this, he, he commentates on this passage.

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,680
 He says with a parable, he says, suppose you have a friend verse five in Luke chapter 11.

195
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 Suppose you have a friend and you go to him at midnight and say, friend, lend me three

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
 loaves of bread.

197
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,720
 A friend of mine on a journey has come to me and I have no food to offer him.

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
 And suppose the one inside answers, don't bother me.

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
 The door is already locked to my children and I are in bed.

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
 I can't get up and give you anything.

201
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship,

202
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,080
 yet because of your shameless audacity, he will surely get up and give you as much as

203
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,080
 you need because you have the audacity to go to him at midnight and knock repeatedly

204
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,040
 on his door.

205
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,000
 And you express a desire that's not your own selfish desire, but a desire to care for those

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
 around you.

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,640
 He will meet that need.

208
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
 He will come to the door and he will answer it.

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,760
 Jesus is saying something really important about God.

210
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
 He hears your prayers and he answers them and he wants you to ask him.

211
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:48,960
 Now, as he's saying, there's some magic number of times you need to ask and ask him and keep

212
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,600
 asking him until you wear him down until he's so tired of you asking, he's a fine already.

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,600
 No, no, that that is not what he's saying.

214
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,760
 He's saying that when you ask and you believe that he can meet your needs and you can come

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,040
 to him anytime with anything, he hears your prayers and answers them.

216
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,720
 I'll illustrate this with a historical story about Alexander, the great.

217
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,080
 Alexander, the great, the great conqueror, the great ruler of a people, very wealthy

218
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,800
 man had a general who was one of his primary generals and his this general's daughter was

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,360
 getting married.

220
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,800
 He comes to Alexander, the great and says, sir, would you please be so kind to pay for

221
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,600
 my daughter's wedding?

222
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
 I do not have enough money to pay for her wedding.

223
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
 Would you pay for it?

224
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
 I have been faithful to you in battle.

225
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
 I have led led your army in many battles.

226
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,520
 Would you please pay for my daughter's wedding?

227
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,240
 And Alexander, the great responds, yes, go and talk to my treasurer and tell him how

228
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
 much you need.

229
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,920
 This general goes to the treasurer and expresses an exorbitant amount to him.

230
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
 The more amount than he had ever seen spent on any wedding.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,640
 And the treasurer is appalled and insulted by the notion.

232
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
 In fact, he says, hey, you wait right here.

233
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
 And he goes to Alexander, the great and says, you will not believe how much money he asked

234
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:12,960
 for.

235
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
 Look at this amount.

236
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,400
 Do you want me to go and punish him?

237
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,760
 Should I throw him in prison?

238
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 And Alexander, the great says, no, do you not realize this man has done me a great honor

239
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,200
 for he realizes that I am not only wealthy, but I am also generous given what he asked

240
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,440
 for.

241
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,640
 And likewise, God is not only wealthy, the cattle on a thousand hills are his.

242
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,920
 Everything is his.

243
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,280
 He's not only wealthy.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
 He's not only powerful.

245
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,160
 He's not only sovereign.

246
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,000
 He's also very generous and he loves you and he's kind to you and he listens to your prayers

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,960
 and he desperately wants a relationship with you.

248
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
 Let me say that again.

249
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,960
 And the reason I want to say that again is because anytime a preacher says God is desperate,

250
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,920
 I would question them.

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
 And I said, God is desperate for something.

252
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
 He's desperate for a relationship with you.

253
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 Not a one time conversation and ongoing relationship with you.

254
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,840
 I know he's desperate because he's gone to desperate measures to get it.

255
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,920
 Sacrificing his only son, which I have a son, I can't even imagine.

256
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,560
 To have a relationship with you.

257
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,760
 And so I will tell you before we go any further, that there is no such thing as a low maintenance

258
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,400
 relationship.

259
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
 I've sometimes young adults, sometimes you guys tell me like, oh yeah, it's when this

260
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
 relationship is so great, it's low maintenance.

261
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
 She's low maintenance.

262
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
 No, no, there's no such thing.

263
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
 That is a relationship that is ending.

264
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,400
 Okay, there's no, there's no such thing as a low maintenance relationship.

265
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,240
 All relationships require maintenance.

266
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
 If you're like, oh yeah, we're such great friends.

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
 We never see each other and we never talk to each other.

268
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
 I would say you're not great friends.

269
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,760
 You're delusional.

270
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,840
 Okay, that you're not great friends because relationships, all relationships by definition

271
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,720
 require maintenance and your relationship with God is no difference.

272
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
 What I'm saying is there is no cruise control in Christianity.

273
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,960
 Let me say that again.

274
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
 There is no cruise control in Christianity.

275
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,960
 You know what I'm saying?

276
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,520
 I think we all want to get to this place where we're like, okay, I've got faith.

277
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,280
 I know God, God, you and me are good.

278
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,280
 Let me shift over into cruise control, hang a foot out the window and just, just cruise.

279
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,520
 Right.

280
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,160
 And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,440
 I want to continue to talk to you.

282
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
 I want you to continue to build in this relationship.

283
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,880
 I want you to continue to ask, continue to seek, continue to knock.

284
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,920
 There's no cruise control in Christianity.

285
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,000
 And so God answers prayers.

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,560
 Yes, he does.

287
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,240
 He will always say yes, no, or not now.

288
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,600
 And regardless of what he says, you can trust that it is for your good.

289
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,800
 And so seek for the answers, look for the answers.

290
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,640
 Why might God not give me this?

291
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,680
 Why might a loving father give me this?

292
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,640
 It doesn't seem like a loving father would give me this.

293
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,000
 And so I think we play these weird superstitious games, right?

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,240
 Well, if I ask according to his will, that's what first John 5, 14 says.

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,880
 If I ask according to his will, I will give it.

296
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
 He will give it to me.

297
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
 What does that even mean?

298
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,680
 Like, cause it seems to me at like a face value, it seems like, well, if I asked for

299
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,240
 what God was already going to do, then I'll have it.

300
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,740
 What?

301
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,520
 And if you didn't ask, you'd also have it cause he was already going to do it.

302
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,160
 So what are you saying?

303
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,120
 Here's what I think that means.

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,920
 Let me break that down.

305
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,320
 If you ask seeking what it is that he wants, but okay, let me say this again.

306
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,520
 If you ask looking for what God wants, but it doesn't mean that you don't ask for what

307
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,160
 you want.

308
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,720
 That's what I see in this text that you ask God for what you want.

309
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
 You want to know what I pray for.

310
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,040
 Let me tell you right now what I pray for every day.

311
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
 What I pray for anything I want.

312
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,280
 That's what I pray for every single thing that I want.

313
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,200
 Now your prosperity gospel radar might be going off, but let me just, I'm just shooting

314
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,760
 you straight.

315
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,280
 Anything I want, I pray for all while seeking what God wants.

316
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
 God, that's what I want.

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
 What do you want?

318
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,160
 Father, this is what I want.

319
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,200
 Father, this is what I would like that car.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
 I would like that house.

321
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,440
 God, I would like that situation.

322
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
 What do you want for me?

323
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,200
 I want to know what you want.

324
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
 Will you align my heart?

325
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,920
 I want to be a man after your own heart.

326
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
 That is a man that desires what you desire.

327
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,840
 Would you do that in me as I come to you and we converse?

328
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,200
 Because I think we've played this weird game where it's like, okay, well I'm, I really

329
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,280
 want a, you know, a high rise in uptown.

330
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,160
 Yeah.

331
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,840
 I'm going to ask God for a high rise in uptown.

332
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,280
 Yeah, but there's also like starving children in Africa.

333
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,240
 I better pray for that first.

334
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,560
 Okay.

335
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
 So, um, and then we feel more spiritual.

336
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,040
 Like God doesn't know you want a high rise in uptown, but you're playing some crazy superstitious

337
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,520
 game with him.

338
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
 And like, he doesn't see your heart and know exactly what you want.

339
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
 And I think what he's saying is, why didn't you just be honest with me?

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,600
 Thank you for praying for children that you don't know, or even really care about that

341
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,840
 much.

342
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,640
 And why didn't you just ask me for the high rise in uptown?

343
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,360
 So that I might change your heart to desire what it is that I desire.

344
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,560
 Can we, can we be real?

345
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,160
 Can we stop playing games with each other?

346
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,120
 You and me, I want an honest relationship with you.

347
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,360
 Can you ask me for what it is that you desire?

348
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,080
 That's what I'm asking you to do this as clearly as I possibly can.

349
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,680
 And so in college, when I was dating a girl, we'll call her Melissa, because that was her

350
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,180
 name.

351
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:06,000
 When I was dating Melissa, I think God wanted me to beg her not to break up with me because

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 that was my greatest desire that she wouldn't.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,680
 And so I think he legitimately wanted me to beg him, God, please don't let her break up

354
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,880
 with me all while showing me that the relationship was not holy.

355
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,440
 It was not godly that if she was an idol in my life and that if she broke up with me,

356
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
 it wasn't going to be that big of a deal.

357
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
 And frankly, probably one of the greatest things that could ever happen to me is for

358
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
 her to end that relationship.

359
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,960
 So I think that God wanted me to beg him, Lord, please don't let Melissa break my heart

360
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,160
 all while he would come and say, Hey, can I show you what I desire for you?

361
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,080
 Why would he want me to ask him that?

362
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,040
 Because it was honest.

363
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,720
 Because it was how I feel.

364
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
 Because it was what I wanted.

365
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,080
 Verse nine, which of you, if your son asked for bread, will give him a stone or if he

366
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,040
 asked for fish, will give him a snake.

367
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,440
 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much

368
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
 more will your father, how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those

369
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
 who ask him?

370
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,000
 Oh, man.

371
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,640
 So my second point is pray to a perfect father.

372
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,800
 Pray to a perfect father.

373
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,600
 This passage is talking about God and it's talking about me.

374
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 And what it says about God is he's a good dad.

375
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,800
 And what it says about me is I'm an evil dad.

376
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
 Do you see that?

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
 It says, if you, though you are evil, it just assumes.

378
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,480
 If you and your role, your role is evil.

379
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
 Your role is evil.

380
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,240
 If you know how to give good gifts to your children, then how much better are the gifts

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
 that come from a perfect, loving, good father?

382
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,880
 If you give good gifts to your children, even though you're evil.

383
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
 I love to give my kids good things.

384
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
 I love to.

385
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
 I delight in it.

386
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,240
 You know, we spayed, we, we saved thousands and thousands of dollars over a long period

387
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,480
 of time so that we could take the three of them to the blistering heat of Orlando and

388
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
 gather around a weird place that worships a mouse.

389
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:22,480
 And so that we could sit in lines that were way too long and deal with their whininess

390
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,600
 and senses of entitlement.

391
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
 You know why I did it?

392
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,360
 You think I wanted to go if I could choose anywhere in the world, that's where I wanted

393
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,680
 to go.

394
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,520
 I did it so I could hear them giggle because I delight in that.

395
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:46,080
 I paid for their smiles and to make some memories with them because I love them that much.

396
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
 And I'm an evil dad.

397
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
 How much better is he than me?

398
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,240
 And so some of you are like, man, my dad never took me to Disney world.

399
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,160
 In fact, he did terrible things.

400
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,920
 He wasn't even there.

401
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,920
 And I would say, don't throw God out with your father.

402
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
 God is not the reflection of your earthly father.

403
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
 He's the perfection of him.

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,720
 God's not like your earthly dad.

405
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,040
 He's like the, your perfect dad, like a perfect dad.

406
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,920
 And you know what this passage says?

407
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,760
 He doesn't give snakes and stones.

408
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
 He doesn't know how.

409
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
 It's not what he does.

410
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
 It's not his character.

411
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,480
 He can't not give you good.

412
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,320
 God will answer your prayer every single time with something good.

413
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
 Is that crazy?

414
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,560
 What I just said, God's going to answer your prayer every single time with something good.

415
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,200
 Now you, here's the only catch I got for you.

416
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
 It might take time and perspective to learn that it was good.

417
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
 You might not fully see that it was good until you are with him in his kingdom.

418
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
 Looking back, it's like, Oh, now I see what you were doing.

419
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,160
 Okay.

420
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,320
 But how do I know?

421
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,360
 If it was a good thing that Melissa broke up with me when it felt like the most painful

422
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,680
 thing in the world, how do I know cancer is not the same?

423
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,960
 Did you hear me?

424
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,520
 You hear what I'm saying?

425
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,880
 How do I know that something terrible right here is not equally as good as that time when

426
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
 Melissa broke my heart?

427
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
 You say, JP, how can cancer be good?

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,080
 Listen, it's a broken world.

429
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,200
 We live in a fallen world, a world that we ushered sin into.

430
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
 And now there's all these sorts of terrible things.

431
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,640
 But the scripture says, God is at work in the terrible things, working out good for

432
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,440
 those who love him.

433
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,480
 And you can roll your eyes and you can shun that and you can think it's not true.

434
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,160
 But I will tell you that if God gave me cancer right now, and I suffered through chemo right

435
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,320
 now in the midst of health, and I'm sure I'd question him and I may have momentary

436
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,200
 doubts, but in the midst of a healthy mind and clear theology, I'd assume he was doing

437
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
 good in it.

438
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
 And I could trust him and you can trust the same thing.

439
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
 You can do the same thing.

440
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
 It may take time.

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
 And it will certainly take perspective.

442
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
 Are you saying that cancer is good?

443
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,400
 Are you saying that my son dying is good?

444
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,280
 I'm saying that your son dying on an instrument of torture in the midst of public

445
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,640
 humiliation, being stabbed in the side, nails in his hands and feet, crown of thorns on

446
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,280
 his head is good.

447
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,760
 You think God doesn't know suffering?

448
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,640
 I'm saying that if you want to know that God loves you, you need to look no further

449
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:03,200
 than what he did for you, to purchase you, to adopt you, to know you, to converse with

450
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
 you, to have a relationship with you.

451
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:14,400
 So that you might ask, seek, and knock, and trust.

452
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,560
 The gospel is how you know God is good.

453
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,280
 Let's have some real talk real quick.

454
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,960
 Right now, there's got to be questions coming in your mind.

455
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,760
 I've got a friend, his name is Daniel.

456
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
 He and his wife, Kelly, got pregnant.

457
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
 Anytime somebody's pregnant, we celebrate.

458
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,800
 He's on staff with me.

459
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,240
 Pregnant, celebration, yay, cue the streamers.

460
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
 Daniel's pregnant, awesome, baby's coming.

461
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,800
 Daniel goes and gets the sonogram.

462
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,240
 Doctor says, "Hey, your baby has a chromosomal disorder called trisomy 18."

463
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,200
 What?

464
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
 "It's not compatible with life."

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 What does that mean?

466
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,480
 It means your baby's going to die in the womb or just outside the womb.

467
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,920
 What?

468
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,120
 That feels like a stone.

469
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,160
 That feels like a snake.

470
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,720
 How, God, how can you do that?

471
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,320
 I can't see how that's a loaf or a fish.

472
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
 It certainly feels like a stone or a snake.

473
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
 God, how is that good?

474
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,800
 I met with Daniel and I asked him, I said, "Hey, I just want to ask you a question, buddy."

475
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:28,320
 I said, "Do you feel the freedom to ask God to present Abel to you?"

476
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,280
 That's his son's name.

477
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,720
 He's healthy, made perfectly in his image, free from any chromosomal disorder.

478
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
 Do you feel the freedom to go to God and beg him to give you a healthy son?

479
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,320
 Now, we're right in the middle of this.

480
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,920
 This isn't something that's going to happen.

481
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,640
 This is right now.

482
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,680
 He answered me really honestly.

483
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,880
 He said, "Kind of."

484
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
 I said, "What do you mean by kind of?"

485
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
 He said, "Well, if I ask according to his will."

486
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,160
 That's just not what I see here.

487
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,360
 That's not what I see here.

488
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,320
 What I see here is you go to God and you beg him.

489
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,440
 If you pound the pavement, you beg him consistently every waking hour, "Lord, please, I want to

490
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,080
 meet you.

491
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,960
 I want to meet you."

492
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,400
 Every waking hour, "Lord, please, I want to meet Abel.

493
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,160
 I want to meet my son.

494
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,080
 I want to hold him.

495
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
 I want to throw baseball with him.

496
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
 I want to see him graduate, God.

497
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
 I want to meet my son.

498
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,000
 God, would you please give me a healthy son?

499
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,800
 That's what I want."

500
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,480
 Lord, whatever you do, not as an asterisk or some superstitious add-on, whatever you

501
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,800
 do, I will steward to the best of my ability for your glory and your honor.

502
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,200
 But if you want to know what I want, I want a son.

503
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,040
 That's what I want.

504
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,280
 I think the scripture gives you the freedom to say that.

505
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,520
 Daniel sent this email to the staff.

506
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
 Here's an excerpt from his email from a book he was reading.

507
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,160
 "In my prayer times, there seemed to be two options available to me as a believer, each

508
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,320
 justified in the scripture, but polar opposites.

509
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,960
 I could accept this tragedy as my lot in life, passing through the hand of the only one able

510
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,840
 to change things.

511
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,640
 That's God.

512
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
 For it is he who is in control of all things, sovereign and at work and in the midst of

513
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,440
 every good gift and terrible occurrence.

514
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,760
 I could resign myself to an inevitable outcome, and my prayer would be that he be near to

515
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,800
 us, not to overwhelm us and to fulfill us with his claims in our time of need."

516
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,840
 That's a great prayer.

517
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,800
 "And I prayed that."

518
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
 That's a great prayer.

519
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,440
 "Yet despite how plausible and appropriate such a prayer seemed, I was unable not to

520
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
 append a cry for more.

521
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,800
 And so I did.

522
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,400
 My life of faith in Christ told me to believe against rational leanings otherwise, that

523
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,760
 God was able and that he actually requested me to ask him the impossible, all with the

524
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
 believing heart of a child.

525
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,600
 He would have to tell me no, and it would not be for lack of asking if he refused the

526
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
 answers that I sought.

527
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,040
 I would beg for healing or misdiagnosis.

528
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
 Any miracle would suffice.

529
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,160
 I asked that the nursery be needed, prayers lasting for long stretches but containing

530
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,280
 very few words.

531
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,600
 Please let us know this child.

532
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,880
 It is my logic, my simple mind that tells me the Lord does not want us to have a baby

533
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,000
 with trisomy 18.

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,160
 But beyond my logic, I asked maybe why.

535
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,760
 And I could conceive of a situation where he would be trying to spare that child of

536
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,200
 something, some hardship in life or something that lays ahead or and or that he would entrust

537
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,480
 to this couple, a suffering to steward for his glory.

538
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,760
 In fact, that article I just read comes from someone in the exact same situation who put

539
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,480
 out a YouTube video where 5 million people saw and heard the gospel.

540
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,440
 Because of this child's life.

541
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,080
 And so as Daniel read that, he was motivated to pray differently.

542
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,280
 And I tell it to you so that you might pray differently, because I know so many people

543
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,160
 that say, hey, that was the hardest thing I ever went through, but I wouldn't change

544
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,480
 a thing.

545
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,920
 I know a man that was born with no arms and no legs that became the greatest blessing

546
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,720
 in his life that he had no arms and no legs outside of knowing Christ.

547
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,800
 I know another dear friend of mine whose son was born with Down syndrome, and he would

548
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,280
 say the greatest blessing in his life outside of knowing Jesus was his son Noah with Down

549
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,240
 syndrome.

550
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,640
 When it looked like a snake and a stone, God said, no, it's a loaf and a fish.

551
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,360
 Give it time.

552
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 Tim Keller says, God either gives us what we ask for.

553
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,560
 Or gives us what we would have asked if we knew everything he knows.

554
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,200
 Verse 12, so in everything due to others, what you would have them do to you for this

555
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,880
 sums up the law and the prophets.

556
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,480
 That's a big two letters right up front.

557
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
 It says so.

558
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,400
 So as, as you know this about God, your father in everything, because so therefore in everything

559
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,120
 due to others, what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets.

560
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,960
 My third and final point is that God often answers prayers through people that you might

561
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,040
 be the answer to someone else's prayers, or at least have the means to answer someone

562
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,200
 else's prayers by the way you do good to them.

563
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,760
 That God may have you where you are.

564
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,720
 Let me say that differently.

565
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,440
 God certainly has you where you are when you are there for a reason and purpose to use

566
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,940
 you.

567
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,440
 And so if your father gives good to those who ask him, then what would his children

568
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,840
 do?

569
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,440
 They ought to do the same.

570
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,920
 If your father in heaven, your perfect father.

571
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,000
 Gives good to those who ask him, then his children, his reflection should do the same

572
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,500
 thing.

573
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,160
 So you might be the answer to someone else's prayer.

574
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,440
 George Mueller was a well-known Christian in the 1800s.

575
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,760
 Well-known because of two reasons, his kindness to orphans and his prayer life.

576
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,160
 Notably, he cared for over 10,000 orphans in his lifetime.

577
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,240
 He was not a wealthy man, but known for his kindness and his prayer life.

578
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,600
 There are lots of stories about like similar to the one I'm about to tell you.

579
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,040
 On particular day, he sets the table for a mealtime for dinner and there's no food in

580
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,540
 the cupboard.

581
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,320
 There's no food in the pantry.

582
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
 They're empty, right?

583
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,440
 And his kids are sitting there at the table.

584
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,680
 And so he goes to pray to God for the food that they are about to receive, yet they have

585
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,480
 no food.

586
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,400
 And he says, Lord, we thank you for the food we are about to receive.

587
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,120
 And as he says, amen, there's a knock at the door and it's a baker from a nearby bakery

588
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,360
 who says, last night I had a dream that the Lord wanted me to come and provide this food

589
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,840
 for you.

590
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,560
 And he gives them enough bread and baked goods for everyone there until their bellies

591
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,040
 are full.

592
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,240
 And that's not all.

593
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,280
 At that same time, a milk truck goes by and breaks down and he then comes to the door

594
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,040
 and says, my truck is broken down.

595
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,960
 Do you have need for all of this milk?

596
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,680
 As George Mueller with empty cupboards, prayed to God for the food that he was about to receive.

597
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,120
 This is the faith that marked his life, the prayer life that marks life.

598
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,920
 And you know what?

599
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,280
 As you think of that, it's like, well, that's true.

600
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
 In the 1800s, cool one man.

601
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,720
 No, I hear those stories all the time.

602
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
 I mean, whether it's like there's one particular one, I didn't have enough money to go to

603
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,520
 college.

604
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,880
 I needed this exact amount.

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,440
 And, you know, these guys come around me and said, hey, we felt compelled to give you this.

606
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,480
 Another one said, hey, I was going to go on this international trip.

607
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,400
 I needed exactly $1,700.

608
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,120
 We got in a room, we prayed.

609
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,640
 Everyone said they would give this amount.

610
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,040
 And when I added it up, it was exactly $1,700.

611
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,360
 People who wanted to go to launch, but I couldn't afford a ticket.

612
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,120
 And then someone lo and behold, just says, hey, the Lord put it on my heart to provide

613
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
 for you a way to go.

614
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,160
 Because their prayers were answered through people.

615
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,800
 Do you see that?

616
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,480
 Anywhere you see the golden rule, it's in a negative form.

617
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,200
 Do not do unto others as you would not want them to do to you.

618
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,160
 But God says, no, no, let's focus on what you should do.

619
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,120
 Meet the needs of others.

620
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,080
 Care for others.

621
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,200
 These are from some of my favorite stories of just being here.

622
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,120
 People all around you have prayers they need answered.

623
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,760
 And you might be the agent that God uses to display his goodness and his love to them.

624
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,000
 And so in summary, in summary, pray with persistence.

625
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
 Pray to a perfect father.

626
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,240
 And be a person who God uses to answer the prayers of others.

627
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,600
 The reason that I felt compelled to meet with my friend Daniel

628
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,280
 was because I had been in that situation.

629
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,040
 And shortly after Monica and I were married, some of our closest friends called us.

630
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,280
 We had just recently celebrated their pregnancy, and they said they were just leaving the doctor

631
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,080
 and their child had been diagnosed with trisomy 18.

632
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:22,080
 She had cysts on her brain, holes in her heart, dilated kidneys, and clubbed feet.

633
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,000
 They then brought in a specialist that looked at this information, trisomy 18 specialist,

634
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
 and he said, "Yes, this is the situation, but here's the deal.

635
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,560
 We can take the child, and you guys can try again."

636
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,800
 And they said, "No, we cannot abort this baby because of our faith.

637
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,840
 We don't know, you know, but we believe in a God.

638
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
 We can't do this."

639
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
 And they said, it was terrible bedside manner.

640
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
 They said, "You don't wanna carry a baby for nine months that you won't get to hold

641
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,680
 or play with.

642
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,320
 Don't do this."

643
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,360
 And they said, "No, we will."

644
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,200
 And their community gathered around them, and we prayed.

645
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,640
 We begged God.

646
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
 We pleaded with Him.

647
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,600
 "Lord, we wanna meet Rayleigh.

648
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,280
 Father, we wanna know Rayleigh.

649
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,520
 God, why wouldn't you want us to know Rayleigh?

650
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,160
 Lord, we will steward whatever suffering you have."

651
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,520
 Do you guys know what I mean by steward?

652
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,720
 "We will make the most of, we will use it to your glory and honor and your benefit.

653
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,680
 We will trust you in the suffering that you're at work.

654
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,480
 We will steward it as best as we can."

655
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,360
 That's all you can do with suffering is steward it to the best of your ability.

656
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,720
 "Lord, if you take this child, we will steward our suffering.

657
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,560
 But Father, we wanna meet her.

658
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,760
 We wanna play with her.

659
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,960
 We wanna know her.

660
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,880
 We wanna hold her, laugh with her."

661
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,440
 And Rayleigh was born.

662
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,080
 Here's a picture.

663
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,080
 We didn't know what that would be.

664
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,120
 And they said, "Oh, lo and behold, the holes in the heart healed themselves and the cysts

665
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,760
 on the brain are gone and the kidneys seem fine.

666
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
 She's just born with club feet."

667
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,880
 And they sent my friend, Mike and Erica, to Scottish Rite Hospital to a specialist with

668
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,440
 club feet.

669
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,160
 And she got there and he said, "What are you doing here?

670
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,640
 Go home.

671
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,000
 Your baby doesn't have club feet."

672
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,600
 And here's a picture of Rayleigh today.

673
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:27,440
 [Applause]

674
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
 Hey, can I just tell you something?

675
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
 If God takes Rayleigh to night in her sleep, he's still good.

676
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:41,280
 If God takes her into his kingdom tonight, welcomes her in, I mean, how selfish am I

677
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,240
 gotta be to say that's the worst thing that could happen to Rayleigh?

678
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,200
 God, I trust you in that.

679
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,840
 I'm sad.

680
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,880
 I'm mourning.

681
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,000
 It hurts so bad.

682
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,400
 But Lord, I trust you.

683
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,520
 You're a good God.

684
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,560
 I got a little bit of life on this earth and I'm gonna live it for you.

685
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,200
 I trust you.

686
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,840
 I know the Lord has given you some, some of you, some terrible things to steward.

687
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,320
 And you haven't stewarded them in your sadness.

688
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
 You stayed there in a state of grieving and anger.

689
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,720
 And he says, "Man, I want to show you that it's a loaf or a fish, something that you

690
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,640
 can use to feed others in their time of need.

691
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,880
 Will you let me show you that?

692
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,440
 Will you let me show you that?

693
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,280
 And if you think I can't empathize in your suffering, will you look to the cross where

694
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
 he watched his son die slowly and painfully?"

695
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,280
 In an effort to simply show you that he loves you and he forgives you.

696
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
 I'm not delusional.

697
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,640
 I'm not just pretending it's okay when it's not.

698
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,320
 I'm not looking at bad situations and calling them great when they feel bad and awful and

699
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
 I really think they're awful.

700
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,960
 I'm just saying I trust God is good.

701
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
 Let me say that differently.

702
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,560
 I know God is good.

703
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,200
 He can't give snakes.

704
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,440
 He can't give stones.

705
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,320
 And so if I have something that's a snake or a stone, I'm just gonna assume I need some

706
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,280
 time to gain perspective and trust him.

707
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,600
 Let me pray.

708
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:40,000
 Father, you're a good father.

709
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,280
 You're a good father.

710
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,280
 You give good to us.

711
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,080
 Lord, help us to believe that.

712
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,640
 Help us to look to your son, Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for our sins, not by

713
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,360
 accident, but by your plan, according to your will, so that you might break him out of the

714
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:09,440
 grave to display an empty tomb and the hope that we have that we can know that we're gonna

715
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,880
 be with you forever and ever and ever in your kingdom.

716
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:23,280
 Lord, help us believe you're a good father, a perfect father who desires to give good

717
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,160
 to his children.

718
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,880
 And help us to know you.

719
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,400
 Even now.

720
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,640
 God, I pray for Daniel and Kelly and Abel.

721
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,920
 God, I pray that you would heal that child inside of her womb, that it would be a misdiagnosis.

722
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,000
 Any miracle, anything that you choose to do will be fine.

723
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,840
 God, we want to meet Abel.

724
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,040
 We want to know him.

725
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,240
 We want to laugh with him and hold him and play with him.

726
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
 Lord, would you do that?

727
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,800
 That is what we want.

728
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
 Please do that.

729
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,160
 And father, this is not an asterisk.

730
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,960
 This is not an and but or this is listen, we'll steward whatever you choose to give

731
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,560
 us, trusting that it's not a snake, trusting that it's not a stone, trusting it is a fish

732
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,280
 or a low, something that we can use for your glory and honor, something that we can delight

733
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,000
 in somehow, some way with perspective.

734
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,040
 We will steward that Lord, but we beg you God, sovereign Lord, we plead with you.

735
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,880
 Please give us a healthy baby boy.

736
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,960
 You're a good father.

737
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,160
 Just help us to know that.

738
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,360
 The phrase echoing in my head is is an interesting one from the Texas and though you're wicked

739
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,440
 and I just think about how much I love my kids.

740
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,360
 I mean, if you tried to give my kid a poisonous serpent, I would wrap it around your neck

741
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,160
 and choke you out.

742
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,960
 I mean, I love him.

743
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,000
 I'm crazy about him.

744
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,840
 And like, I don't even I don't after reading the text, I don't know that God, you know,

745
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,680
 the way that I let Finley eat that hot chocolate thing.

746
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
 I don't even think God would do that.

747
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
 I don't think you could do that.

748
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
 He's like, no, you just I'm not going to let you do that.

749
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,440
 Like, I want to give you good.

750
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,320
 And let me redeem the brokenness in the world in the way that you steward that which you

751
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,520
 think that you don't want.

752
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
 Let me show you that you can trust me.

753
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,520
 He answers those prayers.

754
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,720
 He hears them and he answers them.

755
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,280
 And he wants you to ask what you want while you seek what he wants, seeking what he wants.

756
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,080
 But be honest with him.

757
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,160
 He desires a relationship with you only.

758
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,280
 A relationship with you, not this check the box thing, but like a daily conversation,

759
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,440
 ongoing conversing with you, a relationship, one that's that requires maintenance.

760
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,600
 I remember being in this room and there was like a section of people just like right here.

761
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,840
 That's all that showed up on Tuesday nights.

762
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,840
 And can we turn the lights up and turn the lights on?

763
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,800
 And and I remember with this little section of people, I was like, I'm going to go to

764
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,480
 and I remember with this little section right here, I said, here's what I want you guys

765
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:20,960
 to do.

766
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,520
 Okay.

767
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,520
 And I said, and I had everyone turn around and because everything else was empty, all

768
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,680
 of that, there were no people up there and there and there.

769
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
 And in fact, can we just do that?

770
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,160
 Just just you guys right here.

771
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,120
 If you're on the floor, can you just turn around and look that way?

772
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,480
 And you could keep looking that way.

773
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,840
 And I just want to tell you something that that you keep looking that way, because I'm

774
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,760
 going to talk to you for just a minute as you do.

775
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,400
 Did you know?

776
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,880
 Did you know that that, you know, college students, you know, they sneak in here during

777
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,360
 the summer.

778
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,920
 We know that you do if you're listening and and they're about to go back to school.

779
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,120
 And they're about to make room.

780
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,480
 And so here's what happened when when this little group of people turned around.

781
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,600
 I said, can we just pray?

782
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,240
 Can you find a seat up there that's empty?

783
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,680
 And you pray that one of your pagan friends, you know, that that you one of your old drinking

784
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
 buddies or whoever they are that don't know God.

785
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,000
 Would you just pray that they would fill a specific seat?

786
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,120
 I said, look at a seat and pray that they would be sitting in it.

787
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,840
 And we did.

788
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,280
 And is that not an answer prayer?

789
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
 I'm not saying all you guys up there are pagans or anything.

790
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,440
 Let's thank God for that answered prayer.

791
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:37,680
 And I tell you that because he may make space again as some friends return to universities

792
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:45,120
 around this country for you to go to a coworker and say, hey, will you come and see not the

793
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:52,960
 porch, but my Jesus learn from the scriptures here with the Lord might want to say to you.

794
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,360
 And so our friends gathered in Houston, they just text us this photo.

795
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,400
 That's them in Houston.

796
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,760
 Pretty awesome.

797
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
 If you know someone in Houston.

798
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,760
 Yeah, praise God.

799
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,800
 They're going to gather every Tuesday night.

800
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,960
 And so, listen, if you're here and you don't have other brothers and sisters who can pray

801
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,640
 for you, other brothers and sisters who can meet your needs, other people who are Christians.

802
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,880
 If you're a guy, we do have open community group.

803
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,600
 You can go down this corridor right here in a room and there'll be guys that would love

804
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,320
 to get to know you.

805
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,560
 If you're a girl, you can walk down this hallway and there's a room there of girls that would

806
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,600
 love to get to know you.

807
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,200
 But everyone has a profession.

808
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,320
 I say that most of you, most everyone here tonight has some job that they will return

809
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,600
 to tomorrow.

810
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:45,120
 And we want to help you be on mission in that place, whether you're a teacher or an engineer,

811
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,760
 a scientist, or whatever you do.

812
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,240
 Okay.

813
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,560
 I don't know what you do, but a barista, I don't know what you do.

814
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,520
 You're an artist.

815
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:53,840
 Okay.

816
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,680
 Of sorts, a graphic designer, a software engineer, you work in computers, technology, a consultant.

817
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,480
 Okay.

818
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,440
 We're going to gather, do this deal tonight called affinity groups.

819
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,680
 And so that you can go and sit with other people that do your exact profession and hear

820
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
 them talk about how they live on mission.

821
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,200
 And so here's a kind of map that's going to be up on all of the TVs.

822
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,040
 You can go and look at it and find out where you to go.

823
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,320
 But I would just invite you to hang out for a few more minutes with us and gather with

824
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,040
 other people who do the same thing that you do.

825
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,240
 And if you heard something tonight where you're like, Hey, I don't think God is good.

826
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,560
 I'm telling you, it's the most unloving thing that you can think.

827
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,480
 And we would love to try and convince you.

828
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,040
 Otherwise, please come and talk to someone in a red shirt.

829
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,520
 Love you guys.

830
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,040
 Have a great week of worship.
