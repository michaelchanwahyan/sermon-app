[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.460]   [VOCALIZING]
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:29.420]   Well, how we doing, Porsche Dallas?
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.420]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.580]   I want to welcome you to the porch.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.660]   My name is Josiah Jones.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.900]   I have the privilege of being on staff here serving
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.940]   with the Young Adult Ministry.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.560]   And if you're watching online, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.140]   And all of our Porch Live locations around the nation
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.580]   just placed in different places in our nation,
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.300]   whether that be Porch Live Des Moines, or Porch Live Boise,
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.780]   Porch Live Scottsdale, Dayton, Ohio, Porch Live Atlanta,
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.320]   and a whole host of other Porch Live locations.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.540]   Can you help us welcome them?
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.420]   You picked a really good time to be here at the porch.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.620]   And we're really excited about what God's going to do tonight.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.260]   And before I get going and introduce our guest speaker,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.140]   I just want to say thank you for joining us here
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.900]   on a Tuesday night.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.700]   We know you could be in a lot of different places in Dallas,
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.780]   but you're here.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.480]   And I was having brunch earlier in the week,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.800]   and I invited my waitress to the porch.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.180]   And she said, oh, yeah, like the restaurant?
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.460]   And I said, no, no, no, no, not the restaurant,
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.620]   the young adult ministry.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.780]   And so maybe you got kind of coming to the porch
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.460]   thinking it was the restaurant and bar,
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.340]   but you're here on a Tuesday night
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.540]   at Watermark Community Church.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.820]   We're glad you're here.
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.220]   And so you're in for a real treat,
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.100]   because who I want to introduce you to is really
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.820]   near and dear to my faith.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.100]   When I came to know Christ several years ago,
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.260]   this man was instrumental in my growth.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.860]   And I found him through a podcast,
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.740]   through a friend who sent me a podcast.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.700]   And then I read books about just the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.500]   in which he wrote.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.620]   And this person that I'm talking about is Matt Chandler.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.060]   And yeah, and you resonate with me
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.860]   when I say, hey, he was instrumental in my growth.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.820]   You resonate with it, because the same is true for you.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.520]   And so I remember picking up a book
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.460]   that he wrote in 2011 called "The Explicit Gospel," where
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.420]   it just gave me this robust, high view of who
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.540]   God is, the life, the death, the burial,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.100]   and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.300]   And it just exploded.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.220]   The gospel exploded off the pages in my mind and heart
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.580]   and just caused me to fall more in love with Christ.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.820]   And then a year later, he wrote a book
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.700]   called "To Live is Christ and to Die is Game,"
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.660]   where he just walked us through the book of Philippians.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.700]   And so if you still don't know who Matt Chandler is,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.140]   he is a lead pastor at the Village Church in Flower Mound,
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.300]   Texas.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.540]   And so he is here tonight to bring the word.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.340]   And so before he comes up, I want
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.820]   to pray and thank God for him.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.700]   And really, let me do that right now.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.420]   Thank you, Matt, for the investment
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.580]   that you have made in the kingdom of God.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.460]   Only heaven knows the fruit that has come out of his ministry
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.820]   and that continues to come out of his ministry
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.900]   through his faithfulness.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.700]   So thank you, Matt.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.820]   Let me pray.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.180]   God in heaven, we are honored and humbled
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.860]   that you have brought Matt Chandler to the porch tonight.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.100]   God, we know that you don't need us,
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.940]   but you choose to use us in spite of us
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.220]   to accomplish your purposes.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.220]   And I'm thankful for the faith that you've
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.140]   given Matt and the way that he has leveraged
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.420]   his life to make you known.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.640]   And God, I'm just excited about the word
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.460]   that you have for him tonight, that you would use him
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.020]   in a powerful way, that his voice would be your voice,
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.300]   that, God, your words would explode in our hearts.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.900]   And God, we wouldn't see a mere man,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   but we would see straight through Matt to you.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.940]   And God, it would cause us to have a deep faith in you
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.940]   as our Lord and Savior.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.660]   And so God, use him in a powerful way tonight.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.020]   And God, if there's people here that don't know you, God,
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.540]   may they come to know you as a result of tonight's service.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.780]   We love you, and we thank you.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.860]   It's in the holy and precious name of Jesus Christ
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.180]   I say all these things in.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.900]   Amen.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.940]   Give it up for Matt Chandler.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.340]   Hey, it's good to see you.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.580]   If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.140]   We're going to be in Job chapter 1.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.900]   And I know you're thinking, not on a Tuesday, Matt.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.860]   You're not doing Job on a Tuesday.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.900]   You saved that for Sunday.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.100]   And yet, I think there's something really beautiful
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.540]   about Job for you and for me.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.860]   And so if you have your Bibles, go ahead and turn there.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.300]   What I'm going to try to do in the next 35 minutes
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.540]   is preach through the book of Job.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.500]   So that's really-- that's aspirational,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.260]   and we'll see how it goes.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.180]   When my oldest daughter, who's about--
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.900]   she's 20 now.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.700]   She's not about 20.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.380]   She is 20-- was about four or five years old.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.100]   We were in our car, and we were heading to Possum Kingdom Lake
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.020]   for a little rest.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.860]   Apparently, that committee up there
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.380]   didn't get to vote on what to call the lake,
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.820]   and they landed on Possum Kingdom Reservoir.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.620]   And so we were heading out to Possum Kingdom,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.340]   and Audrey, she had several days earlier been bitten by something
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.220]   and had like a bug bite on her leg.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.820]   And so it was bothering her.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.780]   She was scratching it.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.940]   And if you've been around kids, you've got to-- hey,
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.860]   don't scratch that.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.740]   But you wouldn't be able to stop scratching it,
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.940]   and so you're trying to explain to a four-year-old mind,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.860]   I know that feels good.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.820]   You're making it worse.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.500]   But she was alone, and she just kept itching at it.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.460]   And then we stopped for gas.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.340]   And my in-laws were coming with us.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.300]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.020]   I really like my in-laws.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.740]   Like, jackpot on the in-laws, right?
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.220]   My father-in-law's given name is Johnny Walker.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.100]   He played tailback at Southern Miss.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   I mean, that's like jackpot-level stuff.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.100]   And we're getting gas, and my mother-in-law
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.740]   comes to the car, as mother-in-laws do
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.980]   when you have grandchildren.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.740]   And Audrey rolled down the window quickly,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.020]   because this usually, for Audrey, means whatever she wants.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.820]   And so she rolls down the window and says hi to Mimi,
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.620]   and then begins to explain to Mimi that her leg hurt
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.100]   and that something bit her.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.580]   My mother-in-law, who's a very intelligent-- despite this
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.940]   story, my mother-in-law is a very intelligent woman,
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.180]   raised two God-fearing young adults, one of whom
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.740]   I am madly in love with, looked at my little four-year-old
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.900]   daughter's leg and said, oh, that looks like a boil.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.620]   I hope they don't have to lance that.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.500]   No, we're fine.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.340]   My daughter's four.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.140]   What does she know about lancing stuff?
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860]   So she asked, what is that?
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.860]   And this woman, who raised two God-fearing, well-adjusted,
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.460]   successful adults, said to my four-year-old daughter,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.660]   it's where they take a lance, a scalpel,
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.300]   and they cut it open to let the poison out.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.780]   Now, I don't know how well-adjusted
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.940]   the four-year-olds you've been around are,
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.300]   but mine has a lot of Chandler in her,
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.940]   which makes her frenetic with energy, passionate in desire,
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.660]   and stubborn in will.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.260]   And so for the next two hours, I can't get the radio loud
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.020]   enough to cover up Audrey's screams of,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.500]   I don't want him to cut my leg.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.860]   I don't want him to cut my leg.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.180]   I don't want him to cut my leg.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.100]   And I'm smart enough now at the age of four for her to not go,
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.980]   oh, baby, they're not going to cut your leg,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.260]   because they might.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.540]   And I'm trying not to be a liar as best you can with kids.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.100]   And so by the time we get to Possum Kingdom,
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.460]   and really by the next day, it's obvious that this is a boil.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.540]   It has grown.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.260]   Her leg is hot to the touch.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.420]   And so we go to the hospital and/or vet in Mineral Wells.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.700]   And I think it was both.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.900]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.380]   And we take Audrey in.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.340]   And the nurses come in, and they check her out.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.740]   And if I offended one of you from Mineral Wells, I'm sorry.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.940]   It was confusing.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.700]   And this internist, he's innocent.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.820]   I mean, he knows nothing of my mother-in-law's
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.500]   medical explanation to my four-year-old, walks in,
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.100]   and he doesn't hardly-- he's in the room for like three
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.300]   seconds, and he just looks at it, and he touches it.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.620]   And he says out loud, yeah, that's a boil.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.020]   We're going to need to lance it.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.100]   Now, at that moment, my four-year-old daughter
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.660]   somehow developed the strength of 1,000 sons.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.620]   And there aren't enough nurses in the state of Texas
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.940]   to pin that little girl down so they could
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.940]   numb her leg and lance it.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.500]   And so she's like throwing nurses against the wall.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.700]   And finally-- that's hyperbole.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.380]   And the doctor, this punk kid internist, looks at me
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.260]   and enlists my help.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.660]   Dad, I don't know where Lauren went.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.820]   Like, where did Lauren go?
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.460]   Where'd my wife go?
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.140]   She knew this.
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.420]   So I had to crawl on this bed, use my forearm
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.660]   to pin my little girl down to the bed,
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   with tears streaming down her face, eyes of fire and betrayal
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.860]   penetrating my soul.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.500]   I'm trying not to cry.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.020]   I feel like there has to be another way.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.700]   And I have to pin her down until they put that lidocaine
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.900]   in her leg, and then they lance the boil, and they wrap it up.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.820]   And she's in therapy right now, and she's doing fine.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.780]   No, there was a--
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.500]   maybe that's true.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.940]   But there was a moment on that hospital gurney
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:00.540]   where I'm using my strength to let something painful happen
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.700]   to this little girl that the first time I ever held her,
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.580]   I felt I'm still really capable of violence.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.380]   And I felt like in that moment, that
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.020]   might be the closest I'll ever get to understanding
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.580]   God and suffering.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.180]   That might be the closest I ever get to understanding
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.580]   God and suffering.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.300]   And so one of the reasons I love the Bible--
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.060]   I mean, I love the Bible.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.180]   And you're probably like, yeah, that's
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.680]   going to be helpful for what you do.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.860]   But I love the Bible.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.740]   And one of the reasons--
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.480]   there's a lot of reasons I love the Bible.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.540]   But for the purpose of our 35-minute tour
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.300]   through the book of Job, I love the Bible
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.780]   because it's a grimy book.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.220]   The Bible never paints a picture of reality that's
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.140]   inconsistent with our lives.
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.860]   It never does.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.580]   It is a grimy-- it is not a children's book.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.660]   In fact, to try to make it a children's book
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.900]   makes you skip over certain stories
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.540]   that there's no childlike way to tell the story.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.660]   It is a-- like, every bit of pain, hardship, trauma, loss,
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.980]   disappointment, disease, death, crisis, tragedy imaginable
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.540]   is in the book.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.580]   Like, if this is meant to manipulate people,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.880]   it is a terrible work of propaganda.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.500]   It is grimy from beginning to end.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.860]   Genesis-- it is a grimy, grimy book.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.200]   It's like the Bible wants us to know.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.660]   The God of the Bible wants us to know that suffering
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.260]   is going to be normal, that disappointment
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.540]   is going to follow us, that confusion and disorientation
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.820]   around certain realities of life in a fallen world
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.420]   should be expected among His people.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.540]   Now, what's difficult in 2023, and maybe what's
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.940]   been difficult for the last 20 years,
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.900]   is that you and I are in this really
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.660]   odd moment in human history.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.660]   And if you've got any kind of education in regards
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.220]   to history or sociology, you know some of this is true.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.260]   Like, we live in this tiny little window,
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.580]   and the first window that's really ever existed,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.500]   where we are shoveling the idea that everyone's reality should
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.320]   be one of chipper gladness and ever-increasing happiness
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.580]   with very little confusion and disappointment.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.660]   And what sociologists are now finding--
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.540]   not Christian sociologists--
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.940]   they're finding this idea of perpetual happiness,
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.780]   like up and to the right life, is actually
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.940]   doing a lot of damage to our souls.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.380]   Because look at me.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.860]   That's no one's life, regardless of what they're
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.300]   taking pictures of and posting.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.660]   So there are all these popular-level books being
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.140]   launched out of this research.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.660]   One of the oldest ones is a book called
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.940]   Amusing Ourselves to Death, which I just like the title.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.820]   Some of the newer ones, The Happiness Trap.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.660]   Anybody pick up The Happiness Trap?
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.900]   I mean, that just kind of shows you where we are.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.820]   Nobody's picking up The Happiness Trap.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   We want to, like, give it-- show me the happiness.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.700]   Or Anti-Fragile, The Coddling of the American Mind,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.780]   most recently Lost Connections.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.340]   All of these books are saying the idea that suffering
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.940]   is abnormal and happiness is every day of our lives--
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.140]   and it's always up and to the right-- is absurd.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.220]   And the more you actually believe and think that's going
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.140]   to be your life, the more anxious, the more depressed,
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.580]   and the more hopeless you will grow.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.100]   In enters the book of Job.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.420]   Well, let me start here.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.020]   Let me explain Job.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.980]   It's just a bad book to put in the Bible,
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   I think, if you're trying to win converts.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.660]   Now, it's probably a great book if you're trying
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.220]   to dial people into reality.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.860]   In the middle of the Bible, there are these four books.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.220]   They're called the Wisdom Literature, right?
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.420]   They're like, this is how life works.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.140]   This is how human flourishing works.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.380]   And there are these two books in the Wisdom Literature.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.620]   They're telling the same story, but they're telling it
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620]   from a different vantage point, right?
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   One of those books is Ecclesiastes,
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.780]   another chipper little book in the middle of your Bible.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.540]   And so what happens in the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.500]   is Solomon wants to test if there's anything worth having
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.260]   under the sun, and he goes hard at it.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.100]   He's a king.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.180]   He's the wealthiest man on earth.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.300]   He makes Bezos look broke.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.540]   I mean, this guy's got, not only does he have cheddar,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.740]   but he's got power.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.780]   He's a king.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.820]   There's no Senate.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.020]   He can do what he wants, and he has enough cash
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.260]   to make it happen.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.220]   And the book of Ecclesiastes tells us
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.220]   it goes something like this,
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.100]   that he starts out like most young men do
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.580]   in the party scene.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.020]   And so he throws a party,
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.260]   and here's what he found out about parties.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.500]   They're fun, right?
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.340]   That's what he says.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.460]   He's just like, you know what I found out about partying?
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.260]   It's actually a pretty good time.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.540]   And so he gives himself, and he parties, man.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.380]   He goes pretty good.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.580]   And about two or three, four or five months in,
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.140]   we don't know the timeframe,
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.300]   he starts going, this party's kind of lame.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.420]   So does he quit partying?
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.260]   Oh no, man.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.140]   No, he ratchets it up.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.060]   He's like, we're gonna throw a bigger party tonight.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.180]   And he brings live music.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.100]   Get rid of that DJ.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.020]   We're going live music, live band.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.900]   More barrels of wine, all right?
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.860]   More food, more.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.300]   And he throws a bigger party,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.740]   and he goes hard for another year, another two years.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.740]   And he goes and tells them, man, this party is lame.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.420]   And so then he goes even bigger,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.420]   and you can find a list of just what he was barbecuing
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.420]   at these parties.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.500]   Something like 200 head of cattle,
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.940]   like 400 birds, like 400 chickens, man.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.260]   Like, I don't know if you've ever been to a barbecue.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.100]   You ain't been to a barbecue like that.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.060]   I know you got your little Labor Day thing you do,
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.460]   but this is something different.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.140]   I mean, this man goes hard.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.220]   He goes so hard that he can't go harder.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.300]   And he wakes up in the back of an El Camino
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.180]   with a new tattoo.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.740]   He has no memory of what just happened.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.300]   He's got to figure out how to get back to Jerusalem.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.820]   And maybe that's a prophetic word for one of you.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.060]   And then he gets back to Jerusalem,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.300]   and here's what he's like, it's not gonna work.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.100]   This party scene is not going to work.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.100]   And so then from the party scene, he moves to business.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.860]   If party isn't gonna do it,
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.820]   then I'm gonna build an empire.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.860]   And so he plants vineyards, and he builds cities,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.860]   and he is wildly successful.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.380]   If you went to Jerusalem to this day and went east,
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.860]   you would find these craters called the Pools of Solomon.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.980]   And they are there
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.660]   because he planted full forests and vineyards.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.180]   And so I know you put that little crate myrtle
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.460]   out on your balcony.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.460]   This is something different than that.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.300]   And he got to the place
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.460]   where he couldn't be more successful,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.100]   that the neighborhoods he built
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.620]   and the companies he had acquired
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.980]   and the vineyards he had planted
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.580]   and the forest that he had made,
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.700]   there just wasn't anything bigger.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.580]   And he said, "Dang it, this is worthless too."
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.380]   In fact, the refrain of the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.220]   is vanity is vanity, all is vanity,
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.540]   or meaningless, meaningless, all is meaningless.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.020]   Brother just needs a hug.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.740]   So he starts in the party scene and it doesn't work.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.740]   So then he moves to the big,
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.020]   builds an empire for himself.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.580]   So he can't build it any bigger and it doesn't work.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.780]   So then he moves over to pleasure.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.180]   Normally in 2023, we like to pair up that pleasure
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.740]   with our party phase, but he waits.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.460]   He's kind of a tycoon now.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.460]   So he goes pleasure and he does not hold back on pleasure.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.960]   There's not body type, position, or experience
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.860]   that he doesn't give himself over to.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.340]   And guess what he said about it?
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.700]   "That was awesome until it wasn't."
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.860]   And then vanity of vanity, all is vanity.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.940]   And then he gave himself over to what he just calls leisure
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.640]   or what we would call self-care.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.060]   Gives himself over to self-care.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.500]   He just goes out to the ranch.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.940]   He's getting a massage, got a chef cooking meals.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.780]   He just doesn't do anything.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.420]   He just gives himself over to a life of leisure and says,
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.580]   "This isn't working either."
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.660]   And so Solomon exists because you and I
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.300]   will find ourselves stuck on a treadmill
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.760]   'cause we can't get that level of success.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.260]   We are never gonna have that level of money.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.340]   I'm not gonna have that level of power,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.820]   even if you do have that level of money.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.720]   So Solomon's there going, "Done it, it ain't gonna work.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.020]   That party scene, I've been all the way to the end.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.740]   It's just gonna leave you with a lot of regret
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.580]   and a broken heart.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.620]   Hey, I built an empire, it's not gonna deliver.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.820]   Hey man, I gave myself to that wildness
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.460]   and let me tell you what I got from it.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.940]   Nothing, pleasure in the moment, regret after it's over.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.020]   And then I just gave myself,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.940]   or you know what I really wanna do?
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.300]   I just want cucumbers on my eyes.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.420]   I don't want anybody to talk to me.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.900]   And I did that and it's meaningless.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.820]   There is nothing under the sun
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.440]   that will satisfy the souls of man.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.220]   Then there's Job.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.220]   Job doesn't gain everything and find out God is enough.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.220]   Job loses everything and finds out God is enough.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.780]   Now this is important because you and I
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.160]   are stuck between these two brothers.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.740]   I'm not saying you hadn't suffered.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.900]   I'm saying you hadn't suffered like Job.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.580]   And I'm not saying you hadn't been successful.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.300]   I'm saying you can't be as successful as Solomon.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.020]   Which means you and I are stuck between these two men
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.060]   and we don't have to follow their trails
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.500]   because they're telling us guys,
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.100]   "Hey, it's not gonna work and he's enough."
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.460]   They're both saying he's enough
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.220]   from a different direction.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.860]   And with that said, let's read the book of Job.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.680]   Not the whole thing.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.600]   Let's start in 1.1.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.140]   There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.620]   And that man was blameless and upright,
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.340]   one who feared God and turned away from evil.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.300]   So I just wanna stop.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.340]   And you're like, this is gonna take forever.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.980]   No, trust me.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.340]   Like Job's a good man.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.620]   Like he's an upright man.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.220]   He's a good husband.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.900]   He never swindled anyone out of money.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.620]   He is a respected man.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.740]   He works hard.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.580]   He loves his wife.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.420]   He's good to his kids.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.360]   He's a good, upright man.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.780]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.400]   And then from there, this book takes this really weird turn
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.420]   where God's on his throne
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.580]   and the angels are presenting themselves before God
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.380]   and Satan comes in.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.340]   And God says, "What have you been up to?"
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.500]   And Satan says, "Ah, perusing the sons of men."
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.860]   And God says, "You consider my God Job?
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.980]   "My God Job loves me.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.340]   "He's upright, he's righteous.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.700]   "Oh, please.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.560]   "Like you've blessed him with every,
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.660]   "like he's one of the wealthiest men on earth.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.040]   "He got like a billion kids.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.340]   "I got a wife, he got respect.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.180]   "But if you let me take all his stuff,
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.420]   "he'll curse your name."
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.860]   And God sets parameters.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.980]   Don't touch his body.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.260]   Don't kill him.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.900]   Take his stuff.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.100]   And here's where we pick up the story again.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.240]   Now, there was a day when his sons and his daughters
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.900]   were eating and drinking wine
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   in their oldest brother's house.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.220]   And there came a messenger to Job and said,
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.700]   "The oxen were plowing
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.900]   "and the donkeys feeding beside them.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.680]   "And the Sabians fell upon them and took them
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.320]   "and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.980]   "And I alone have escaped to tell you."
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.500]   And when he was yet speaking,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.900]   there came another and said,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.700]   "The fire of God fell from heaven
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.920]   "and burned up the sheep and the servants
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.180]   "and consumed them.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.260]   "And I alone have escaped to tell you."
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.580]   And while he was yet speaking,
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.300]   there came another and said,
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.900]   "The Chaldeans formed three groups
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.140]   "and made a raid on the camels and took them
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.300]   "and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.180]   "And I alone have escaped to tell you."
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.860]   And while he was yet speaking,
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.820]   there came another and said,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.900]   "Your sons and your daughters were eating
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:35.360]   "and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.740]   "And behold, a great wind came across the wilderness
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.180]   "and struck the four corners of the house
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.860]   "and it fell upon the young people and they are dead.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.700]   "And I alone have escaped to tell you."
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.220]   Then Job arose and he tore his robe
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.940]   and he shaved his head and he fell on the ground
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.380]   and worshiped.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.780]   And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.620]   "and naked shall I return.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.160]   "The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.260]   "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.500]   And in all of this, Job did not sin
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.300]   or charge God with wrong.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.060]   I would like to just state the obvious.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.900]   Job is better than we are.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.580]   I made some charges against God
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.860]   just trying to get here to preach this thing
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.980]   coming down 35 to 635.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.060]   I make charges against people in the left lane
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.180]   who are going the speed limit.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.260]   I just have a problem with that
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.980]   and I think the Lord probably has a problem with that.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.940]   And so I was asking the Lord for justice.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.260]   He's a better man than we are.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.060]   And then what happens is the scene shifts back
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.340]   to God's throne room and God is in his throne
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.580]   and here are the angels again and here comes Satan
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.980]   and God boasts on Job to Satan.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.820]   He's like, "Hey, Satan, you hear that?
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.980]   "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.040]   You hear, "Oh my gosh, is that Job?
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.620]   "That's Job?
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.580]   "Did you take all his stuff?
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.700]   "You did take all."
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.780]   You hear, "He gives and takes."
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.940]   That's about me.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.340]   He's singing about me.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.380]   And then Satan fires back.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.620]   That's because he has his strength.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.900]   Let me take his strength and he'll curse your name.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.300]   God sets parameters again.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.640]   You can inflict him.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.020]   You cannot kill him.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.860]   And we pick up the story again.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.060]   So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.340]   and struck Job with loathsome sores
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.660]   from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.640]   And he took a piece of broken pottery
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.540]   with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.980]   And then his wife said to him, "Ladies, don't do this.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.020]   "Do you still hold fast to your integrity?
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.100]   "Curse God and die."
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.580]   But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.500]   "would speak."
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   Husbands, I wouldn't do that.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.240]   Shall we receive good from God
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.540]   and shall we not receive evil?
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.440]   And in all of this, Job did not sin with his lips.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.140]   Now, what happens next is Job's friends.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.140]   Everybody hears about this, right?
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.760]   This is a famous, wealthy tycoon of a man
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.580]   who's highly regarded.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.740]   It's clear that he's favored by God.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.820]   And his close friends come.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.700]   And when they see him, they weep.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.460]   And no one says a word for seven days.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.060]   All they do is they see him, they're heartbroken.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.260]   They don't tell him that all things work together
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.100]   for the good of those who are called by God
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.160]   according to his purposes.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.500]   They just see him and their heart breaks
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.660]   and they weep for seven days.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.420]   And if that's all they would have done,
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.100]   we would know their names and we would celebrate them
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.820]   for being an example of what to do when it hurts.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.900]   But unfortunately, they opened their mouths.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.980]   The next major section of the book of Job,
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.700]   you won't read it, are his friends giving him advice,
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.420]   telling him and trying to explain to him
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.260]   why these things have happened to him.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.420]   And what I think they, what I'm gonna argue they represent
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.500]   is they represent what happens when we suffer,
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.660]   when we're disappointed, when we're confused,
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.020]   when we're disoriented, when it's happened to us,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.700]   or when it's happened to somebody we love,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.260]   when we don't understand, when we're disoriented,
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.140]   what happens when you look around, right?
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.020]   So you're looking around, you're trying to figure out,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   what is, how do I make sense of this?
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.380]   I've heard that God is good.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.900]   How do I make sense that this has happened to me,
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.500]   that this has happened to my friend,
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.860]   that this person I love,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.180]   how do you make sense of this level of brokenness?
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.340]   And I think there are four things that can happen to us
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.340]   when we start looking around.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.800]   And I think Job's friends represent those four things.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.980]   Here's the first one.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.980]   We can, if we're not careful in a world broken by sin,
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.100]   we can become fatalistic.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.220]   Do you know what I mean by that?
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.060]   I'm gonna date myself.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.900]   Maybe I will, maybe I won't, I don't know.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.500]   You remember Ferris Bueller's day off?
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.020]   Cameron, remember Cameron?
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.100]   Like Cameron won't get out of bed.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.980]   He's convinced he's gonna die.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.300]   Why bother?
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.500]   And he won't, he didn't wanna do anything.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.940]   So Ferris is trying to coax him out.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.220]   He just doesn't wanna leave
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.140]   'cause he knows he's gonna be dead at any moment.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.140]   So he didn't wanna try anything.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.220]   He doesn't care about school.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:10.140]   He doesn't care about college.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.100]   Doesn't care about girls.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.300]   Doesn't care about, he doesn't care about,
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.540]   'cause he's like already decided it's over.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.260]   Well, one of the things that can happen to us as Christians
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.100]   if we're not careful,
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.940]   one of the things that can happen to you,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.420]   maybe especially if you're not a Christian,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.260]   is you can look around
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.260]   and you can develop a real fatalistic view of life.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.460]   Like you can just decide
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.660]   that it's always gonna be bad for you,
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.420]   that it's never gonna work out for you,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.140]   and you can become paralyzed
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.340]   and no longer live into your calling,
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.660]   live into your purpose.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.260]   You just, and here's how I experience this
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.620]   as a pastor, a pastor of the same church for over 20 years.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.780]   Some people will over identify with their suffering
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.900]   until they are that suffering.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.300]   You tracking with me?
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.900]   Like they can't even, they're just the sick one,
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.020]   and the only way they know to relate to people
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.220]   is to be sick, and so they take it on as an identity.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.260]   It's not something that's happened to them.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.300]   It's not something that's part of a broken, fallen world.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.520]   It's like who they are.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.140]   So I'm the sick one.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.060]   I'm the one that always has the migraines.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.460]   I'm the one that can't get pregnant.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.660]   I'm the one that's this.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.060]   And they own it.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.420]   They own the disease.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.260]   They own the suffering as like their primary identity,
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.180]   and they stop even knowing how to relate to other people
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.340]   except through the disease,
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.860]   except through the suffering,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.220]   except through the loss,
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.180]   except through the disappointment.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.540]   They become jaded and fatalistic,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.860]   and why bother?
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.940]   Why get out of bed?
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.300]   And that's one of the things that happens
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.580]   if you just start looking around
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.780]   to make sense of life in a sinful world.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.100]   Another thing that can happen is actually quite Buddhist,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.220]   and it's this idea that suffering isn't real.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.940]   You just need to kind of detach.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.100]   So kind of a popular level of Buddhist teaching
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.760]   is that suffering actually doesn't exist.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.460]   You're just too attached,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.380]   and if you would detach yourself
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.380]   from the things of this world,
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.020]   you would detach yourself from your stuff,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.000]   you would detach yourself from relationships,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.120]   you would detach yourself from the things of this world,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.200]   you wouldn't be able to suffer
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.040]   because you couldn't lose anything
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.240]   because you've kind of reached divine detachment.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.120]   Now, with no smoke towards the Buddhist,
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.200]   what a terrible way to live.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.280]   Here's what I know.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   To be attached, biblically speaking,
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.560]   either in friendship or in marriage,
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.860]   puts you in harm's way.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.440]   To love someone puts you in a dangerous spot.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.480]   Do you know who I don't think can hurt me tonight?
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.320]   You.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.720]   Like, I think when this is over, you'll be like,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.560]   that guy's, I hate that guy.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   You can get it on Instagram.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.320]   Lame.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.760]   Study harder.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.680]   And here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.280]   I'm gonna show my wife, like, look at this guy.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.600]   This guy lives crazy.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.560]   Oh, you wanna see his profile?
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.160]   Yeah, look, no, he lives with his mom.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.600]   Yeah, it's a, you know, it's like this.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.880]   Like, I win.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.040]   Yeah, I win.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.920]   And I'm not, but you know who could absolutely destroy me?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   Lauren.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.680]   I mean, oh my gosh, with just a sentence,
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.720]   she could kill me.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.000]   And it's worth it.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.760]   And some of you, I love you, you have made unholy vows
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   that no one's ever gonna hurt you like that again.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.080]   That you're never gonna allow anybody else
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.600]   to do that to you.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.000]   And in so doing, you have closed yourself off.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.560]   You have refused to be known.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.980]   You have refused, in essence, to be loved again
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.680]   or to take the risk of loving another.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.840]   I'm not talking about abuse.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.640]   That's not, yeah, you make that vow.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.600]   I'm not talking about that.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.680]   I'm not talking about abuse.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.560]   I'm not talking about that stuff.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.040]   I'm talking about general relationships
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   and letting people in, loving and being loved in return.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.800]   The person who looks around goes,
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   no, I'm not gonna let anybody hurt me like that again.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.280]   I'm not gonna set myself up for that kind of disappointment.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.680]   I'm not gonna take that risk.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.600]   And we start to make what I'm,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.720]   they're unholy vows.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.760]   They're promises in relationship with evil spirits.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.720]   That might be too much for you.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.560]   I mean, you might be like me, Baptist background.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.600]   You're like, evil spirit.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.640]   Like it's what happens when you say,
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.840]   I won't, no one will ever do that to me again.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.880]   I'm not talking about abuse.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.240]   I'm talking about just being known and knowing.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.200]   I'm talking about being loved and loving.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.000]   Like no one gets to do that to me.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.920]   You make this vow and then you build like armor around you
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.280]   so that nobody ever can.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.160]   And you can build that with theology
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.720]   and you can build it with all sorts of
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   kind of antisocial behavior,
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.240]   but you kind of build a wall around you
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.120]   and it's all for self-protection.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.800]   And you grow increasingly jaded,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.200]   increasingly angry, increasingly mean.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.200]   And then gosh, in 2023, you get to brag about that.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.360]   Right?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.400]   It's just heartbreaking.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   It's one of the things that happens is we're just like,
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.080]   I'm gonna detach.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.200]   I'm not gonna let anybody hurt me.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.160]   I'm gonna live in such a way that nobody can hurt me.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.080]   And I'm just telling you,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.720]   all you're doing is emptying your life of meaning.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.840]   The risk is worth it.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   And then the idea of karma, right?
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.280]   That what goes right, you know, like if I do good things,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.120]   good things are gonna happen to me.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.560]   If I do bad things, bad things are gonna happen to me.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.360]   Like you don't actually want karma.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.320]   Karma is a bad gig.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.200]   Like what you want is grace.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.240]   The promise of the gospel isn't karma,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.400]   be good and I'll bless you.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.120]   It's I've got good for you because of me.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.160]   That's what you want.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.760]   You want the grace of God in your life.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.640]   And then lastly, if you're looking around,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.080]   you're just gonna think that suffering's meaningless
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.920]   and random.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.120]   And here's what's interesting about the book of Job.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   Job throughout the book,
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.800]   although the Bible says he does not sin in it.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.440]   He's constantly, his friends are like,
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.280]   this is what happened.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.160]   You know, if you were righteous,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.000]   this wouldn't have happened to you.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   He's like, that's not it.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.960]   In fact, I wish the Lord would come down.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.160]   I've got some questions for the Lord.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.360]   I need the Lord to answer my, like I, I've served him well.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.600]   I've praised his name.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.360]   I've done good with my money.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.280]   I loved my wife.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.200]   I loved my kids.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.680]   I did what he called me to do.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   How could this, I got questions for God.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.840]   Why?
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.360]   How in the world am I supposed to move forward
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.080]   with him in light of this?
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.040]   And then it's like,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.400]   here's what's fascinating about the book of Job.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.280]   God never answers his question.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   It's almost as if the creator God of the universe,
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   who's alpha and omega, he is outside of time.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.720]   Are you tracking with me when I say that?
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.200]   It means the future isn't something he knows about.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.720]   It's a place he is right now.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.120]   Let that bend your brain a little bit, right?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   Like God's not a prophet per se.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.320]   He's not like prophesying about the future.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.760]   He's there right now in his fullness
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.520]   while being here with us right now in his fullness.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.920]   He is outside of time.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.640]   We are inside of time.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.320]   He knows all things and how all things lead to other things,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.480]   creating other things, moving other things
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.520]   that create other things without ever getting tired
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.320]   or having his brain seize up.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.960]   How could we possibly comprehend
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.960]   life in a fallen world as limited as we are in our flesh?
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.600]   Augustine, who's my ancient friend,
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.040]   he described life in this world
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.640]   as having your face pressed up
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.200]   against a stained glass window.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.280]   He's like, you're gonna see some colors.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.720]   It's gonna look like things are broken
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.440]   and we just can't get far enough back
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.960]   to see that it makes something beautiful.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.480]   And I'm telling you,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.240]   I've been pastor in a church for 20 years.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.200]   I know all the horrific things that can happen to people.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.080]   And I think I understand what Augustine means
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.760]   that sometimes you look up and all you see
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.040]   is shattered glass, at least that's what it appears to us.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.640]   And so it's as though God knows
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.600]   our brains are too small to comprehend
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.200]   that there's no way for us to possibly put
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.760]   all of that together as limited as we are in our flesh.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.600]   He has always been and will always be.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.200]   And we're like a half a second.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.080]   We really are.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Like, you know, the old adage,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.200]   you're here today, gone tomorrow.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.840]   You know, the Bible didn't even give you that.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.920]   Bible's like here in the morning, gone by lunch.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.080]   You're like the dew of the grass that's here in the morning
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.280]   and by afternoon is gone.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.240]   So you're not even like here today, gone tomorrow.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.640]   It's like you were there in the morning and by brunch,
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.480]   you're gone.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.240]   And that verse is meant to orient us around God's godness
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.720]   as opposed to our frail humanity.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.680]   So what God does do instead of explaining
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.880]   how this leads to this, that creates this,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.720]   that brings this about, that does this,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.060]   that creates this all the way down the line
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:10.060]   of human history, he says, quit looking around and look up.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.240]   Stop looking around to make sense of all of this
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.360]   and get your eyes up on me.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.240]   That's all he does with Job.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.520]   Job finds like, I got questions.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.240]   And God's like, I've got some questions.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   So how about you dress for action like a man
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.120]   and I'll ask you some questions.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.040]   And really from Job 38, verse four,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.800]   all the way to the end of the book,
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.160]   God just like starts asking Job questions.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.520]   And here's just a little taste of it.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   I'm not gonna read all of that.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.640]   Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.440]   Tell me if you have understanding.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.080]   Who determined its measurements?
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.540]   Surely you know.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.560]   Or who stretched the line upon it?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.960]   On what were its bases sunk?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.640]   Or who laid its cornerstone
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.320]   when the morning stars sang together
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.760]   and the sons of God shouted for joy?
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.840]   I mean, we can just keep going.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.560]   Or who shut in the sea with doors
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.040]   when it burst out from the womb?
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.840]   And I made the clouds its garment
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.720]   and thick darkness its swaddling band
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.640]   and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.040]   and said, thus far shall you come and no farther.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.720]   And here shall your proud waves be stayed.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   Have you commanded the morning since your days began?
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.560]   And he goes on and on.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.120]   And this might sound cruel,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.180]   but what God is doing for Job
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.280]   is orienting him around God's power and God's goodness.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.680]   Because here's what in the rest of the scriptures,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.640]   here's how God kind of works when we look up.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.000]   So let me give you just a couple of these.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.880]   I don't have a ton of time left.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.840]   Here are the promises of God when we look up
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.000]   rather than look around.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.760]   So rather than being fatalistic,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.200]   rather than just detaching,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.240]   rather than armoring up,
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.820]   rather than just going, ah, it's inevitable,
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.040]   everybody suffers, is to look at these promises.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.880]   Here's what we're promised,
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.680]   that Jesus is with us in the mess.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.760]   Psalm 23,
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.460]   lo, though I walk through the valley
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.760]   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.880]   Why?
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.020]   For thou art with me.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.000]   So what's the promise when we look up
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.520]   rather than look around and try to make sense
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.020]   of all of this?
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:19.300]   That Jesus will be near and that Jesus will comfort.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.020]   We see in Hebrews chapter four
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.660]   that Jesus is an empathetic high priest.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   A good friend of mine says this verse like this,
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.200]   he knows it's scary to be us.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.940]   We see in John 11 that Jesus sees the lament
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:39.060]   of Lazarus' sisters and he weeps.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.760]   We see in the book of James that nothing is wasted
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.540]   and that suffering produces character
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.620]   and endurance, perseverance, and maturity.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.740]   It makes us strong.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.980]   That contrary to popular opinions,
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.540]   we are not candles that need to be protected
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.180]   from the wind lest we get snuffed out,
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.460]   but actually are like fires that the wind heats up
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.340]   and helps burn hotter.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.700]   You could take the story of the Bible,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.940]   Genesis to Revelation,
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.980]   and you could boil it down to three words,
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.560]   God with us.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.960]   That's the story of the Bible.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.460]   What's happening in Eden at creation except God with us,
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.160]   walking with them in the cool of the garden in the morning.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.680]   And then what happens when God leads his people
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   out of slavery and sets up the tabernacle
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.600]   right in the middle of their encampment,
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   all of their tents.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.200]   When you opened up your tents,
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.880]   you looked at the tabernacle
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.280]   and the manifest presence of God was there.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.960]   Not by faith, by fire and smoke,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.400]   the presence of God.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.640]   And what happened at the temple?
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.040]   The glory of God fell
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.920]   and all of Jerusalem oriented around the temple,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.480]   God with us.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.200]   And what happens at the incarnation of Jesus Christ,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.160]   except God with us.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.720]   And then what happens at the coming of the Holy Spirit?
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.560]   At Pentecost, we're indwelt with the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.080]   become temples of the living God.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.240]   And God is with us.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.360]   Suffering does not mean
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.600]   that we have been abandoned or forgotten.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.200]   It's not what it means.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.880]   God is with us in the mess.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.000]   There's a great deal of mystery
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.560]   around the brokenness and hardship of life as a human being.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.320]   It'll break your brain, it can get so awful.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.620]   Again, I'm not naive to those things.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.800]   I've pastored a large church for 20 years.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.200]   A lot of small coffins
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.100]   and there shouldn't be small coffins.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.840]   A lot of sicknesses that have ravaged a body
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.140]   long after you would think.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.480]   A lot of random loss that feels insane.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.020]   And that's just, I'm just talking about one local church.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.620]   I'm not even talking about lifting your eyes up globally.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:40:02.380]   And yet to look around and try to make sense of that
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.200]   is crushing to the soul.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   And so the Lord says, "Look up, see me."
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.300]   See what in particular?
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.180]   I think primarily see Christ on the cross
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.800]   dying for your sins.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.140]   If God is for you, who can be against you?
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:28.360]   Like to look up and see that God has moved towards you
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.560]   in his love regardless of your rebellion
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.000]   and my rebellion against him.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.600]   That from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.040]   God moves towards his people with grace,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.640]   moves towards his people with forgiveness,
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.960]   moves towards his people with the promise of life,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   moves towards his people with the promise of joy
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.240]   and gratitude and belonging and hope.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.240]   And one day glory and a sense of understanding.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.780]   One day we get far enough back to see it.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.860]   One day there's no remembrance of former things.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.640]   One day there'll be no more tears in eyes.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.680]   One day there'll be no more sickness and death.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.200]   And in the already but not yet, in this space in between,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   the Lord would say, "Look up, look to the cross,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.580]   "see my love for you, see how I've moved towards you.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.560]   "Trust that I am at work in the mess."
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   Because I think that's the story of the Bible.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.200]   God at work in the mess.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.160]   It's not that there's not a mess.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.920]   It's that he's at work in it in a way
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.720]   that's mysterious to us and we can get lost in it
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.300]   if we try to look around and make sense of it.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.200]   And so here's what I wanna lay before you.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.900]   I think here's why I've come.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:44.260]   It has been my experience in Christian circles in particular
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.460]   that if we're not careful,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.060]   we begin to move towards fatalism.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.940]   Like even though we've got the hope of the gospel,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.740]   we've got the hope of eternal life in us,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.540]   what ends up happening is we just start turning fatalistic.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.180]   And I think one of the ways that looks
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.900]   is we cease to be prayerful,
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:01.340]   we cease to be able to see what's good in our life
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.900]   and all we can see is what's wrong.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   I don't know if you know anybody like this right now
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.360]   or maybe you find yourself in that place.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.540]   Listen, I've been tempted to go there myself
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.100]   where I'm just so aware of everything that needs to be fixed
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:17.040]   that I can't see just how good and beautiful and kind
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.000]   God has been to me.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.900]   Like I haven't recounted his goodness
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.880]   because I've seen these five or six or eight
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.980]   or 10 or 12 things that drive me nuts
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.720]   that I don't understand, that seem cruel and unjust,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.520]   so I can't see any of the beauty and grace in my life
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.380]   for all of the kind of railing against what's broken.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.600]   And I wonder if you find yourself there,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.320]   you can feel yourself growing jaded.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.960]   Just feel it, like you just feel yourself growing jaded,
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.240]   slipping, getting angrier,
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.440]   wanting to create distance from the Lord
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.000]   and from other believers.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.880]   And part of what I wanna do in coming tonight
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.740]   is like, hey, don't look up.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.600]   I know I'm not trying to take away from you
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.280]   how frustrating hurt is.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.720]   I'm not trying to take away from you confusion.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.000]   I'm not trying to take away from you
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.080]   even like not understanding what I'm trying to do
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.840]   is lift your eyes up to God's love for you in Christ.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.900]   So I wanna call you out of that fatalism
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.320]   or maybe you're not fatalistic at all.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.360]   Maybe you've gone the other way.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.400]   Maybe you just made some unholy vows.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.840]   Nobody's gonna hurt you again.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.660]   You're not gonna lose anybody you love anymore
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.680]   and you got your whole world so locked down.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.160]   You are so trying to control your entire environment
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.300]   that you are redlining.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.840]   I mean, you are anxious and afraid
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.880]   and barely hanging in there
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.080]   as you try to make sure nothing happens to anybody.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.920]   Like you've taken on kind of like mother hen responsibilities
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.100]   for your whole crew.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.920]   Like I wanna call you out of detachment.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.880]   I wanna call you back into being loved and loving,
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   trusting again, leaning into the risk of being fully known
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.000]   and fully knowing others to give love another shot.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.220]   And then man, I wanna, if I can,
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.100]   I wanna bag on karma a little bit
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.980]   because you're not under wrath, you're under mercy.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.640]   And again, this is,
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.480]   I was talking to the leadership before this
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.380]   and the big struggle of my life,
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.000]   it'll be the, I think my struggle the rest of my life.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.560]   I think I've got some family of origin issues
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.280]   that kind of make this flare,
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.440]   but it is really easy for me to believe
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.840]   that I'm useful for God, to God.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.080]   Then God finds me useful.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.120]   I like this kid, we're gonna use him.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   It's harder for me to believe
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.320]   that he just loves me and delights in me.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.400]   That's just a hard sell for me.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.440]   I'm like, I read it in the book.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.040]   I can wrestle with it in the book.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.880]   It's just hard for me, man.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.880]   I'm an achiever, I'm a doer.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.420]   I received affirmation and affection by accomplishment,
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.000]   not by being.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.320]   And the Lord's always just like, no, it's you.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.240]   I was like, you're what I like, I like you.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.840]   I'm like, well, I did this for you.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.760]   Like, great, but you, why don't you come hang out with me?
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.640]   Well, I would, but I gotta do this stuff
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.480]   because I know you like that.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.240]   He's like, no, I didn't ask you for that, I want you.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.000]   And I wonder how many of you feel stuck
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.920]   in this idea of karma,
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.720]   like you're incessantly trying to work to please the Lord,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.280]   incessantly trying to be good so he'll bless you,
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.600]   incessantly trying to check this box
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.800]   and circle this box and accomplish this
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.200]   so that he'll finally love you.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.920]   I've said this for 20 years, almost every time I've preached.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.460]   God is not in love with some future version of you.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.660]   And I wish you'd, by the grace of God,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.540]   drive that out of your head.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.420]   It's not like once you get that right,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.140]   you and God are finally cool.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.060]   You're cool because of what Christ did,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.900]   not because of what you do.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.800]   You're reconciled because of the finished work of Jesus,
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.020]   not because you're figuring some things out.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.660]   Now, you figuring those things out
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.340]   will, can lead to greater intimacy
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.560]   and experience of his presence.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.180]   But there's nothing salvific in your behavior
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.280]   or Christ didn't need to die on the cross.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.140]   Like it was his death that justifies you,
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.620]   his death that makes you whole,
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.620]   his death that heals you once and for all.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.420]   And so all I wanted to do in our limited time tonight
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.820]   is I don't think hardly anybody talks about suffering
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.940]   anymore, we always talk about the joy of the Lord.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.840]   And what's amazing about his presence
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.920]   is that people in the scriptures
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.940]   who endure some horrific things
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.920]   still seem to have a joy, not a happiness,
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.660]   a joy that's rooted in something bigger
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.900]   than their circumstances.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.300]   And if I could give you anything
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.380]   as you kind of keep running the long journey home,
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.180]   it would be maybe just a little bit more understanding
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.020]   that the world is broken,
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.220]   that suffering's going to be normal,
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.220]   and that Jesus is good.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:40.260]   And to not try to look around and make sense of it
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.180]   as much as you look up and gaze upon the beauty of God
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.860]   in sending the son to die for your sins,
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.740]   resurrect to show the bill's been paid in full,
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.980]   and that life, real life, full life
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   is available to you in Jesus now.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.800]   Why don't you do me a favor?
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.460]   Why don't you just bow your heads and close your eyes?
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.900]   If that's weird for you, I promise,
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.420]   nobody's gonna touch you or take your stuff,
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.660]   well, I don't think they will.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.220]   I'm sure there's some shady people in here,
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.060]   but just bow your heads, close your eyes,
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.960]   but just keep your stuff close to you.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.300]   All right, just a couple of questions, and they don't,
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.700]   it's really between you and the Lord,
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.300]   it's not between me and you, I promise.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.900]   I'll head to a meeting after this
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.220]   and then back up to Flower Mound.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.780]   So I just wanted to ask,
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.540]   like just maybe in a moment of vulnerability
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.820]   between you and the Lord,
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:29.580]   I just wanted to ask if you find yourself
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.260]   in this season of life,
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:40.080]   growing jaded, like growing frustrated,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.560]   growing distant from the Lord,
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:47.300]   and it's tied to some heartbreak,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.580]   some disappointment, some disease,
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.140]   some death, some confusion,
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.860]   some bit of brokenness that you just don't get,
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.020]   and it's hard for you to reconcile
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.700]   that He's good and that this is possible.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.020]   And you're just in a season where you're like,
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:04.620]   man, I can feel my heart growing colder
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.080]   towards the Lord because of these things.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:07.920]   If that's you and you're in the room,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.980]   would you just raise your hand high,
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.540]   like just raise, just get it up high.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.860]   You don't have anything to be embarrassed.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.220]   I mean, you are like you are among
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.600]   almost everybody in the Bible.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.620]   Yeah, like let's get them high like we're not Baptist.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.740]   There we go.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.580]   All right, praise God.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.120]   Listen, there are so many of you in here.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.380]   So go ahead and put your hands down.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.420]   Now I want you to look up at me.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:27.260]   If you had your hand up,
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.500]   I mean, all of you can look up at me.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.220]   The Lord sees you.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   I would just press a little bit
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.140]   that you might think about the rest of the night tonight
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.780]   like this.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.140]   Like this message isn't getting me
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.740]   a lot of followers on Instagram.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:47.180]   This message isn't like, oh, that was awesome tonight.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.260]   This is more of a disorienting thing
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.940]   to come in here and talk about.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.860]   It's certainly not a popularity one.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.500]   So like I'd have done dating if I wanted that.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:00.020]   But this is the thing that will strengthen your soul
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.720]   for life as it is.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.460]   And so here's what I'm gonna ask.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.940]   I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.140]   And we've got some more singing to do tonight,
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.980]   but there are gonna be men and women up here
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.900]   and they're gonna pray.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.620]   And if you raised your hand tonight,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.360]   I just want you to be so bold as to come and receive prayer.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.820]   Just come and let people who aren't in that season,
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.680]   they either have been or they will be one day,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.660]   they're not in that season right now,
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.580]   just pray for you.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.900]   Just pray courage back into your bones.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.760]   Pray life back into your bones.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.060]   I don't want you to walk in shame.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.740]   I don't want you to walk in shame right now.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.100]   I want you to be so bold as to say,
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.220]   I need someone to pray for me
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.580]   'cause I am slipping here, man.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.460]   And that's scaring me.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.340]   I want somebody to pray for me.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.780]   And so I'm gonna pray.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.180]   And then there's gonna be a group of men and women
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.420]   that come up front and they're already coming.
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.980]   And then we're gonna stand and sing, is that right?
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.380]   Davey, are we gonna stand and sing?
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.100]   We're gonna stand and sing.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:55.940]   You like that?
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.300]   I probably could have looked at the notes, it's fine.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.240]   I'm already over.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.220]   And then we're gonna stand and sing.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.420]   And here's what, if you raised your hand,
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.100]   I'm telling you, man, there's like 100 and something of you
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.980]   that you not talk yourself out of it,
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.300]   that you not justify, I'm fine, that was enough.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.380]   Just raising my hand was enough.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.740]   And that you would,
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.500]   this might be a little too charismatic for you,
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.580]   you might activate some faith in your heart
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.440]   by moving your body.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.620]   You might come up and grab the hands out.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:22.620]   You're not gonna make anybody gasp up here.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.820]   You tracking with me?
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.420]   Like you're not gonna say something that makes them go,
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.240]   (gasps)
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.140]   we don't know what to do with you.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.060]   That's not going to happen tonight.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.300]   We know exactly what to do.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.540]   They're here for you.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.580]   I'm gonna pray, we're all gonna stand together.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.420]   And then I just wanna make one last appeal.
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.780]   I know that you're in your head right now.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.540]   I know it 'cause I've been in that seat.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.980]   First seven years of my marriage, train wreck.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.300]   Don't gasp, if she were here, she'd say, yep.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.860]   And got to battle brain cancer for 18 months,
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.580]   was told I'd had two years to live.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.780]   I've been down there.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.180]   I buried little boys and little girls.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.460]   I've seen good men die of cancer
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.560]   where scandalous ones stay alive.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:12.140]   Like come and receive the kindness of the Lord to you
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.640]   in this season, in this moment.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.480]   He sees you.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.400]   Why am I here?
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.660]   Except that he sees you.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:20.860]   Why this for you tonight if he doesn't see you?
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.660]   Now you receive from him now what he has for you,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.300]   blessing and hope and courage
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.600]   from someone who's not in that spot right now.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.100]   Father, I bless these men and women in the name of Jesus.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.740]   I thank you for your goodness and grace.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.140]   Like even the ones that aren't in this room
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:36.220]   and they're all over the country.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.300]   I can't see that room, I just see this one,
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.660]   but I know humanity enough to know,
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.860]   gosh, my friend is right.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.020]   It is scary to be us and you know it.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:52.420]   And so I don't pretend to know all the hurt that's in here,
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.940]   all the disappointment that's in here,
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.180]   but I know that it's real.
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.940]   And I know that it hurts.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.420]   And I know that it's disorienting.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.340]   And I know we can feel stuck in it.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.260]   And I know we can feel like
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.900]   we're never gonna get out of it.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.260]   And I just rebuke the enemy right now
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.260]   because we will get out of it.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.380]   This moment is not our lives.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.140]   This moment is not our lives.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.100]   And so I ask Holy Spirit,
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.940]   minister to your sons and daughters,
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.980]   minister to our hearts tonight
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.220]   in a profound and beautiful way.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:26.540]   Grant courage and boldness to those who are in the pit.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.260]   And it's for your beautiful name I pray, amen.
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.940]   Would you stand with me as we sing?
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.380]   If you need prayer, you come grab it, they're here.
