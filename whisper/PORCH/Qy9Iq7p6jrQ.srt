00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 Hey Porch, please take a seat as we read God's word together.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,200
 Today we're going to read from the book of Luke, chapter 5, verses 1 through 11.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,600
 And it says, "On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
 he was standing by the lake of Gesenaret, and he saw two boats by the lake,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
 but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,600
 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land,

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
 and he sat down and taught the people from the boat.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,200
 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
 'Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.'

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,000
 And Simon answered, 'Master, we toiled all night and took nothing,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
 but at your word I will let down the nets.'

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them,

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 and they came and filled both of the boats so that they began to sink.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.'

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,800
 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,200
 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 And Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching men.'

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,400
 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him."

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
 Now, our first message in our series called "Disciple."

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
 [Applause]

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
 - Thanks, Gabe.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
 Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight?

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
 Yeah, it's great to see you.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Thanks for making time to be with us here in Dallas, Texas,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,600
 as well as all over the nation. So grateful that Porch Live you would tune in.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,000
 Special shout out to Porch Live Scottsdale, Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Midland.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,800
 Anybody from Midland in here?

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,000
 Well, listen, there are a handful of moments in a dating relationship

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
 that are defining to say the least.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,500
 From the very first time you may meet your significant other's friends,

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,800
 and you feel all the pressure of needing to make a good first impression with their people,

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,700
 to the very first major disagreement the two of you have,

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,600
 and yet you know the relationship is worth fighting for,

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
 and so you're not willing to give up on it,

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,500
 and you'll go to great lengths to make sure this thing stays together,

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,100
 to the first time he calls you his girlfriend,

39
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,500
 and you just can't wait to let everybody else know that this is now the state of your relationship,

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,100
 or the first time you actually find yourself on a trip together,

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,800
 and you get a chance to see, like, what do they do before they go to bed?

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,500
 What is their nightly routine?

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,600
 What kind of person are they in the morning?

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,800
 To the very first time one of you risks it all,

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,900
 and says those three small yet oh-so-powerful words,

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,100
 "I love you."

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,000
 There are a handful of defining moments, defining firsts,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,300
 that take place in every dating relationship,

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,100
 but for Brooke and I, there was one moment that surpassed them all,

50
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,300
 that stood out above the rest.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,000
 You know what it was?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,500
 It was the very first time I met her dad.

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,700
 Brooke and I had been dating about a month or so,

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,000
 when I received a text message from her father,

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,300
 asking me to meet so that I could clarify my intentions for his daughter,

56
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,900
 which is a very fair thing for a father to ask,

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,700
 and yet it still sent a very sensible chill down my spine,

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,100
 and so I respond very promptly and say, "Yes, I'd be happy to meet.

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,700
 Where would you like to go?"

60
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,200
 And he responds with no words whatsoever, just an address,

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,000
 a Starbucks that was local to the area that we were supposed to meet,

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 which I assumed was the location of my pending doom.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,600
 Now, there are a few reasons I'll never forget meeting Brooke's dad for the very first time.

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,800
 Firstly, at this time, I didn't have much experience drinking coffee.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,900
 Today, I know my way around the coffee shop,

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,600
 and yet at the time, I knew nothing about the stuff.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,400
 And so I ordered the only thing that I thought was right in a place like Starbucks.

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,900
 I ordered a cappuccino,

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,900
 which is a horrible decision when the guy only drinks coffee hot and black.

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,900
 Like, that's the way he likes it. Cappuccinos don't jive with him whatsoever.

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,800
 Secondly, I remember this moment so distinctly

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,900
 because I didn't want there to be a lull in the conversation.

73
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,100
 Like, I didn't want there to be any awkwardness whatsoever,

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,700
 no silence could take place.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,000
 And so I just nervously kept talking the entire time

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,100
 and told him everything that I wanted to do.

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,200
 After I got out of college, I graduated in the spring,

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,300
 and I moved into the rest of my life,

79
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,900
 and I began to start my career and figure out what it looked like to be a young adult in the world,

80
00:04:51,900 --> 00:05:01,400
 which just confirmed to him the fact that I was a senior dating his freshman daughter.

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,200
 And lastly, and most notably of all,

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,300
 I remember that moment so well because it went incredibly well.

83
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,300
 Like, even though it felt like we got off to a rocky start,

84
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,100
 and I wasn't sure how things were going to end,

85
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,400
 over the course of our time together, I got to share my intentions for his daughter.

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,900
 He got to clarify his expectations.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,700
 We got to remove all confusion in that conversation.

88
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,500
 It changed the course of mine and Brooke's relationship forever.

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,700
 Now, why do I tell you that? Because in the same way,

90
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,800
 as we enter into a relationship with Jesus Christ,

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,000
 he wants to have an equally defining moment with us.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,800
 He wants to come to us and clarify all the intentions about what's going to happen in our relationship.

93
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
 He wants to set all the expectations of what should be true between the two of us,

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,300
 and he wants to remove any confusion whatsoever.

95
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,700
 Jesus wants to make sure we know how we are supposed to relate to him.

96
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,600
 And the way that we're supposed to relate to Jesus is we're meant to relate to him as disciples.

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,100
 We're meant to relate to him as disciples, which may, for some of us in the room, feel surprising.

98
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,900
 Like, we know that Jesus came to save us from our sins,

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,500
 that we were the problem that he came to fix,

100
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 that we were the issue he came to resolve, we were the addicts he came to rehabilitate,

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
 we're the head case that he came to calm down.

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,000
 And yet Jesus didn't just show up to save you from your sins.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,300
 No, no, no. He wants so much more for you.

104
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,600
 Instead, Jesus doesn't just see you in light of your problems.

105
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,300
 He sees you in light of your potential.

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,500
 He sees you in light of your potential. Like, he doesn't just want to clean you up and then kick you out.

107
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,800
 He wants to form you and mold you and grow you and shape you and develop you,

108
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,000
 which is what we all want. Like, fascinatingly,

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,400
 if you go and you look at the trends that we as young adults have set,

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,000
 as we've told the watching workforce what we want to be true of our office spaces,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
 what we have said is we want good coaches more than we want good bosses.

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,700
 Like, we want big purpose more than a big paycheck.

113
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,800
 We want to be cultivated as individuals more than complemented as individuals.

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,000
 What we have told the world, the young adults of our generation,

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,500
 what we have said is what the Bible's been saying all along.

116
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,000
 We want to be discipled. We want to be discipled.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,200
 We want to be formed. We want to be shaped. We want to be grown.

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,600
 We want to be matured in some respect.

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,600
 And yet here's the thing you need to know before you can be discipled.

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,200
 You've got to meet the discipler. And the place that we meet him is in Luke chapter 5.

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,100
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me.

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,900
 Gabe just read it to us and we're going to work our way through it.

123
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,100
 But as you're turning in, let me just put my cards on the table

124
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,200
 and share with you why we are doing this series.

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,500
 We're doing this series because I am convinced that far too many of us have settled

126
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:14,900
 for lives of knowing about Jesus and not actually knowing Jesus.

127
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,500
 Like we think we got him figured out. Like we know what he brings to the table.

128
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,400
 We've got our Christian friends. We've seen the principles that guide, guard their lives.

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,000
 And yet what we know is that he's worth giving part of my life to,

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,100
 but I don't know that I want to give him my full life.

131
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,900
 And yet here's what I would argue. And here's why we're doing this series.

132
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,600
 If you don't give Jesus your full life, then you are costing yourself the fullness of life.

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,900
 It's by following wholeheartedly that we not only become what we want to be,

134
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,300
 but we become more than we ever thought we would be.

135
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,200
 Because we become like him. That's what it means to be discipled.

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
 And that's why over the course of this series,

137
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,600
 I want to do with you what I always do in any discipleship group that I lead.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,200
 I just want to study a handful of snapshots through the Gospels,

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,800
 and I want us to see the real Jesus from the eyes of the men that knew him best.

140
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,900
 I want to put us from the same vantage of the disciples themselves.

141
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,800
 I want us to see what they saw and hear what they heard and walk in their shoes

142
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,600
 and go wherever they went as they followed after Jesus.

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,100
 Because I believe as we see them follow Jesus, not just an idea of Jesus,

144
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,900
 not just some concept of Jesus,

145
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,700
 but the real true Jesus Christ as we see them follow him,

146
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:49,900
 I think, and may I know, that we will learn what it means to follow him ourselves.

147
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,300
 So we've got to start where they started. Luke 5, we'll pick it up in verse 1.

148
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,500
 "On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,

149
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,000
 he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, and he saw two boats by the lake,

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,700
 but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.

151
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's,

152
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,800
 he asked him to put out a little from the land,

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,500
 and he sat down and he taught the people from the boat."

154
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,900
 Okay, so we just need to set the scene

155
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,900
 because we're catching up to Jesus' mid-ministry at this point.

156
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,100
 Like he has already begun his public ministry,

157
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,000
 and what we know is that word has spread about this young traveling prophet,

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
 this young teaching rabbi, and everybody wants a piece of this guy.

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
 Like they've seen the miracles he's performed,

160
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
 and they have heard the authority with which he teaches,

161
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,500
 and everybody wants to get a piece of him.

162
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,300
 Like he's the big-time star that rolls into the small-town square,

163
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,700
 and everybody can't get close enough. Like they all want a picture with Jesus.

164
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
 They all want to get an autograph from the guy.

165
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,300
 And so he, feeling all the pressure as people are gathering around him,

166
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,100
 is looking for a way to just get some breathing room.

167
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,500
 And stage left, minding their own business, are four guys.

168
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,800
 Simon Peter, Andrew James, and John.

169
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,100
 And what you see is these guys are mending their nets.

170
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,200
 They're cleaning their nets. Like they're untangling debris,

171
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
 and they're tying new knots, and they're repairing rips

172
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
 because they had just fished the night before.

173
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,200
 And now that it's daytime, they're preparing to go out and fish again

174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,800
 whenever evening comes. And yet into Peter's world and his boat steps Jesus.

175
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
 Jesus hops into Peter's boat.

176
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,800
 He needs to get some breathing room from the crowds around him.

177
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,900
 And so he asks Peter, "Hey, can you just like push off from land a little bit?

178
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,200
 I need to take this boat for a minute,

179
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
 and I need to turn this thing into my pulpit."

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And so Peter just casually obliges, which may feel crazy to us,

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
 and yet you would do the same thing.

182
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,700
 If Jesus hopped into your boat, not knowing anything about the guy,

183
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
 you would realize there's probably something worth knowing about the guy

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,700
 because all of these people are clamoring to get as close to him as possible.

185
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,500
 And so what we see is that in verse 4, once he had finished speaking,

186
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,900
 he said to Simon, turning his attention from the crowds and to Peter himself,

187
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,300
 he says, "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch."

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:21,600
 And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night. We took nothing.

189
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
 But at your word, I'll let down the nets."

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,500
 So the first thing we got to learn about discipleship from Jesus

191
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,100
 is that Jesus turns failures into followers.

192
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
 That's the first thing we've got to know.

193
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
 As we consider this idea of discipleship,

194
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,100
 becoming a disciple, learning from the eyes of the disciples themselves,

195
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,900
 we need to know that Jesus turns failures into followers.

196
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,500
 He's like the team captain that does not choose the best of the best to play on his team.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
 Instead, he chooses the worst of the worst.

198
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,500
 The reason why is he knows that he's strong enough to carry the squad.

199
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,900
 Like he doesn't look at Peter on the heels of a triple-double and think,

200
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,700
 "Man, that was a new personal best. Like I've got to get you onto my team."

201
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,100
 That's not what he thinks. He sees that Peter just went 0 for 12

202
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,300
 and had six turnovers the night before.

203
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,400
 Peter is anything but suitable to be on Jesus' squad.

204
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,300
 And yet Jesus chooses him anyways.

205
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,100
 Jesus wants failures. He wants to turn them into followers.

206
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,500
 Now, the reason we know he failed is because they fished all night long and they caught nothing.

207
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 Which I don't know about you, but when I read that, that didn't actually feel too crazy.

208
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,900
 Whenever I go fish, I'm not super successful at it.

209
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,300
 And so the thought of fishing all night long does not seem like so much of a stretch.

210
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,100
 And yet what we need to remember is that these men,

211
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
 these four guys that were introduced to in this story,

212
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 and Peter specifically in this moment, they are fishermen by trade.

213
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,300
 Like they were working professionals, experts in this subject area.

214
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,900
 They had grown up learning all the tools of the trade.

215
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
 Like this was their family business.

216
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:07,900
 And so they are absolutely those which should be regarded within this realm far more than anybody else.

217
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,800
 They know more about the topic than the rest.

218
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,700
 That's why they fished at night. On the Sea of Galilee, fishermen would go out in the evenings

219
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
 and using one of three different methods of catching,

220
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,800
 what they would do is they would try to trap fish in shallow waters

221
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,700
 because schools of fish would swim to the shoreline where they would feed on minnows

222
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,000
 and smaller fish in the warmer, shallower waters.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,200
 They would do so in the evening because there wasn't much foot traffic.

224
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,100
 And yet despite having all the tools and all the training and all the technique,

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:43,900
 what we see is that Peter has nothing to show for it.

226
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:51,500
 He's a failure. And he has no excuse to be.

227
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,400
 Which is probably a feeling many of us understand.

228
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:04,300
 Like many of us, we keep falling short, even though we know better.

229
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,700
 Like we have the right knowledge. We have the proper tools.

230
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,400
 We've installed covenant eyes. We've assembled good accountability.

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 And yet what we find is we continue to fall into the swarm of sin that we have carried with us for so very long.

232
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 We know better. And yet we continue to fail again and again and again.

233
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 And it feels like we're the only ones. Like nobody else is struggling with a porn addiction.

234
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:40,100
 Everyone else has moved past that by this point. Or nobody else is struggling with making an impact in the world.

235
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,700
 They've all gone and done it. And yet I'm still stuck here striving to do it.

236
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,900
 Everyone else is already making six figures, but I can't get there.

237
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,100
 I've tried. I've angled. I've applied. And none of it's worked.

238
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,700
 Everyone has moved on from their past hurts, but I can't seem to do it.

239
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,300
 I can't bring myself to go. It's too difficult.

240
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,200
 I'm too identified with that thing which happened to me at some point in the past.

241
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,400
 We feel like what Paul describes in Romans chapter 7.

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,500
 "For I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh.

243
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,800
 For I have the desire to do what's right. I just don't have the ability to carry it out.

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 For I do not do the good that I want, but the evil I don't want is what I keep on doing.

245
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,900
 Now if I do what I do not want, it's no longer I who do it, but it's sin that dwells in me."

246
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:37,200
 Like we're left not mending our nets like these four guys,

247
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,100
 but we are left licking our wounds, wondering, though I know so much better,

248
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,200
 why is it that I keep falling prey to the same sin over and over?

249
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,700
 Why do I keep struggling and falling short?

250
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,800
 When is it going to feel as if I'm no longer a failure, but I'm actually a success?

251
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,100
 Why is it that I never seem to win? I only seem to lose,

252
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,100
 and I continually, perpetually find myself at rock bottom?

253
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
 If that's you, then you need to listen.

254
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:18,200
 Jesus in this story, he doesn't wait for these boys to come to him on their own time.

255
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,500
 He comes to them on his own time. Like he doesn't wait for Peter to have a good night.

256
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,300
 No, he actually shows up after Peter's worst night, after a colossal failure,

257
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,200
 which is just encouraging to us because Jesus doesn't need you to clean yourself up.

258
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,900
 He doesn't need you to make yourself right.

259
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,800
 He doesn't need you to be 30 days sober before you come up to him.

260
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,700
 He doesn't need you to go a month without masturbation before you come to him.

261
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,500
 He doesn't need you to make claim to all the compromise that you've done

262
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 and come clean before everyone in your community before you come to him.

263
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,600
 He will take you how you are, wherever it is you are.

264
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,200
 He wants you exactly as you are here tonight.

265
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,100
 He doesn't need you to shape up. He just needs you to come to the shore.

266
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,800
 You see, Jesus, he turns failures into followers,

267
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 but here's the catch that we learned from this passage.

268
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,900
 He's going to test if we'll actually follow him. Like that's what we see he does with Peter.

269
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,900
 Like he wants to do something great in Peter's life.

270
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,400
 And yet he's going to put Peter through a couple of small tests,

271
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,600
 all of which revolve around something Peter knows exceedingly well.

272
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,500
 All revolve around fishing. He looks at Peter and he's like,

273
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,400
 "Hey man, can we put out? Can we go deep? Will you drop the nets?"

274
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,300
 And Peter has no reason to do it. Like Peter is the fisherman.

275
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,800
 Jesus, you're the carpenter. Peter could pull rank and just say,

276
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,200
 "This is nuts. It's insensible. Why would we do it?"

277
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,700
 And yet what we see is that Peter takes small steps of obedience.

278
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:03,500
 He makes small moves of willingness. Even though this is wildly unreasonable.

279
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
 It doesn't make any sense that Jesus would ask him to do this.

280
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,300
 Like number one, this is the wrong time of day to fish. It's daytime.

281
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,600
 It's not night, Jesus. This is a horrible idea.

282
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,800
 And not only is it the wrong time of day, it's the wrong kind of water.

283
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
 We're in the wrong place. We should be in the shallows,

284
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,700
 but you're taking us to the depths. Why are we in the deep water?

285
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,500
 This is not where we cast nets, Jesus. It doesn't make any sense.

286
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,300
 It's totally unreasonable. And yet here is the thing.

287
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,400
 Miracles seldom happen in the realm of reason.

288
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,500
 Miracles seldom happen in the realm of reason.

289
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,900
 Jesus is taking Peter into an unreasonable place

290
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,000
 because he wants to do something unreasonable in Peter's life.

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
 All Peter has to do is take steps of faith.

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,300
 Now, steps of faith are never easy. Steps of faith are always hard.

293
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,900
 The path of least resistance is never the path of greatest faith.

294
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,800
 And yet what you know is that as Peter takes these steps,

295
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 as he makes these moves, he does so with a skeptical yes.

296
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,100
 But Jesus can do so much more with a skeptical yes than an arrogant no.

297
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,400
 He'll take you with your doubts. You can feel some sense of confusion.

298
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,600
 He can work with that. He just needs you to row out a little bit deeper.

299
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
 It says in verse 6, "And when they had done this,

300
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,600
 they enclosed a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.

301
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,300
 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them.

302
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,200
 And they came and they filled both boats so that both boats began to sink."

303
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,500
 Like Peter takes three small steps of faith

304
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,200
 and Jesus delivers three massive moves of God.

305
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
 They enclosed a large number of fish,

306
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,700
 their nets began to break, and both boats began to sink,

307
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,600
 which is just the most ridiculous contrast.

308
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,400
 Like just think about it. We just read that a team of four men,

309
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,000
 highly trained professionals, working all night long, could catch nothing.

310
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
 And yet one man with some haphazard indifference drops the net

311
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
 and encloses the catch of the century.

312
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,500
 What was the difference? Jesus was with one of them.

313
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,700
 While he was not with the other four. Jesus makes the difference.

314
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,500
 That's what he wants us to see here.

315
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
 Jesus is going to move in ways we don't expect through people

316
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,300
 we wouldn't expect to prove he is far more than we ever expected.

317
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,900
 So several years ago, I was skiing in Colorado

318
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,800
 and I was riding up a chairlift and I was by myself.

319
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,400
 So I was riding alongside one other single, a random guy.

320
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,100
 And as is common courtesy, whenever you're riding up the chairlift,

321
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,800
 we're just making a small talk, easygoing conversation,

322
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,700
 asking where he's from. Hey man, where, you know, how long you here for?

323
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,500
 Oh cool. Has it been a good trip? Like we're just making conversation.

324
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,100
 And yet he looks at me and he goes, hey man, you want to see a trick?

325
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,500
 Sure. It's kind of weird thing. Just you and I up here, but why not?

326
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 And so he takes a piece of his sandwich and he hands me a morsel of bread

327
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,200
 and he says, hey, just throw it over the chairlift right there.

328
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
 And so I take the bread and I throw it over the chairlift

329
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,600
 and out of the trees flies a bird and catches it in mid-flight.

330
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
 He goes, I'll do you one better. Try this one.

331
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,200
 He takes it and he has me place it on, not throw it over the rail,

332
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
 but put it on the armrest itself of the chairlift.

333
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,400
 And as I do, another bird swoops in from a tree and lands on the rail

334
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,900
 and grabs the piece of sandwich and flies off into the unknown.

335
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,400
 And for his final act, as I'm sitting there in disbelief,

336
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,500
 he takes another piece of a sandwich, but rather than handing it to me,

337
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,200
 he holds it out over the edge of the chairlift and not a bird,

338
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:50,100
 but a hawk flies in, land on his arm and begins to eat the sandwich from his hand.

339
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,600
 A few things stood out to me in this moment. Number one,

340
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,300
 that must have been a really good sandwich.

341
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:05,300
 And number two, clearly there's something different about this guy,

342
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,100
 which is exactly how Peter feels in this moment.

343
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,800
 Like Jesus has just done something so unexpected to prove that he is far more

344
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,100
 than Peter expected and it changes everything for him. It freaks him out.

345
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,300
 It says in verse 8, "But when Simon Peter saw it,

346
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,600
 he fell down at Jesus' knees saying, 'Depart from me, for I'm a sinful man, O Lord.'

347
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,700
 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken.

348
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,600
 And so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon."

349
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
 Like Peter, because of this interaction with Jesus,

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,700
 gets an entirely new outlook on life, which we need to adopt ourself

351
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,900
 because you can't reach your potential until you receive a new perspective.

352
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,700
 You cannot reach your potential until you receive a new perspective.

353
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,300
 It's interesting the way Luke writes this account,

354
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,200
 because the minute Jesus shows up and he proves to Peter,

355
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,600
 "Hey, I'm actually so much more than you think I am.

356
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,500
 I'm not just a teacher. I'm God." Everything shifts for that brother.

357
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,800
 Like he changes his name in a blip. He goes from Simon to Peter.

358
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,700
 He stops calling Jesus "Master" and starts calling Jesus "Lord."

359
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,000
 And what you find is his entire perspective shifts.

360
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,900
 He's no longer a skillful fisherman.

361
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,400
 He's a sinful passenger and it's not his boat anymore.

362
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,100
 It's Jesus'. You see, that's what it means when it says that he was astonished.

363
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,200
 The Greek there for the word astonished is the word thambos.

364
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,800
 And what that word means is it's an emotional reaction,

365
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,400
 pairing both fear and awe in one experience.

366
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,300
 It's the way you feel whenever you stand at the height of a skyscraper

367
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,200
 and you look over the edge, like your heart kind of jumps up into your throat,

368
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,900
 you know, like you're horrified by the height of where you are

369
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,000
 and yet you are mesmerized by the view from up there.

370
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
 That's exactly what Peter is feeling in this moment.

371
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,600
 Like Peter sees Jesus as Jesus is. He notices that Jesus is God in flesh.

372
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,700
 And when he sees Jesus for who he is, as he just pulls back the veil

373
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,100
 and he gives him just the smallest of glimpses as to who he is,

374
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,200
 he sees that Jesus is terrifyingly wonderful.

375
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,900
 Terrifyingly wonderful. Wonderful because he is God.

376
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,300
 And yet terrifying because if he can see into the depth of the sea,

377
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,500
 then I know he can see into the depth of my soul.

378
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
 And he won't like what he finds there.

379
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,500
 And some of us can relate to that feeling so much.

380
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,800
 Like we know it's true in our heart of hearts

381
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
 and we're not proud of what's found there either.

382
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,200
 Like we know deep down the envy we have, the hate we hold,

383
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,500
 or the anger we harbor, or the jealousy we carry,

384
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,900
 or the bitterness we bear, or the lusts that we crave.

385
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,800
 And we know it's not acceptable.

386
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,200
 We know it's ugly and cowardly and horrible.

387
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,100
 And so what we want is to conceal it from people.

388
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,500
 We don't want Jesus to see it and we don't want others to see it.

389
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,800
 And so we hide that part of our heart from the watching world.

390
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,400
 We hide it. We conceal it. We act like everything's okay.

391
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,300
 We put up a nice front. We make sure that we only sin in secret.

392
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,900
 We always run from the truth.

393
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,500
 And yet Jesus doesn't want that for Peter.

394
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,900
 And he doesn't want that for you.

395
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,600
 Like though Peter is so afraid of what's happening in me, God,

396
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,200
 and if you see this, you won't want anything to do with me.

397
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,400
 Jesus does not reject Peter. He reaches for him. He grabs him.

398
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,100
 That's what it says in verse 10.

399
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,200
 It says, "And Jesus said to Simon, 'Don't be afraid.

400
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,500
 From now on, you'll be catching men.'"

401
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,300
 Like Jesus looked at him and he says, "Hey, I've got plans for you.

402
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,700
 I've got a future for you.

403
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,100
 I've got a destiny for you the likes of which you wouldn't dream.

404
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,200
 But before we can get there, before I can unleash all of your potential,

405
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 I've got to unlock your perspective. Not just your perspective on who I am,

406
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,500
 that I am God, but your perspective on who you are,

407
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,600
 that I've come to get you. That you're no longer a slave to sin.

408
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,900
 You're a child of mine. You're a part of my family.

409
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,300
 That I'm the one that went to the cross to endure all the consequence of your sin

410
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,100
 and shame and you, because you placed your faith in me,

411
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,300
 now you get all the reward of walking with me in relationship.

412
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,700
 That's what Galatians 2:20 tells us.

413
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,900
 It tells us about a new perspective that we've been crucified with Christ.

414
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,200
 It's no longer I who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.

415
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
 In the life I now live in the flesh,

416
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,700
 I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

417
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,500
 You see, for those that are in Christ, it's no longer you who live.

418
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,000
 It's Christ who lives in you.

419
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And because your life is now his life, you live the way he wants to live.

420
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,900
 And the way Jesus wants to live is he wants to live for what matters most.

421
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,000
 He wants to live for people. He wants to live for people.

422
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
 That's what it means whenever he says,

423
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,100
 "Hey, I'll make you into a fisher of men." The Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark,

424
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,600
 he says, "Follow me. I'll make you into a fisher of men."

425
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,300
 He doesn't look at Peter and say, "Follow me and I will make you happy."

426
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,000
 He doesn't look at Peter and say, "Follow me and I will make you successful.

427
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
 I will make you popular. I will make you healthy."

428
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:47,800
 He doesn't say any of those things because none of those things matter as much as people.

429
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 People matter the most. Why? Because people go on forever.

430
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,500
 The souls of every person in this room, they will not end.

431
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,300
 They will go one of two places. And Jesus is challenging Peter to consider,

432
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,000
 "Hey, what will you give up that you might lean into all of the significance that I have for you?"

433
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I've got a life that I want you to live, Peter.

434
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,300
 Something that really matters, that does not fade, that goes on forever.

435
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,600
 And the truth of the matter is, poor, it's like, can we just level with each other?

436
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 We want that. Don't you? Don't you want a life of significance and meaning and purpose

437
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,200
 and lasting impact that makes a difference in the world?

438
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
 Don't you want that for yourself?

439
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,200
 Like, does anybody in here just want to kind of roll through life in mundaneity and in meaninglessness?

440
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,400
 No, we all want to matter. We all want to make a difference.

441
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,300
 I'm so fired up about it because I know it's true.

442
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,200
 And Jesus is saying, "That's the kind of life I've come to give you."

443
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,800
 And yet, you know what the irony is?

444
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,000
 We all want a life that matters. And yet so often, too frequently,

445
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,600
 we live lives for things that don't matter at all.

446
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:18,500
 We want so badly to be successful, to reach the heights of some pinnacle where everyone knows about us,

447
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,400
 though in a hundred years, no one will know about us.

448
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,600
 We want so badly to get that body to look this way.

449
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,300
 And yet what we find is that in time, no matter how hard we try,

450
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,800
 no matter how much plastic we put on, we're just going to grow old.

451
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 We're just going to wear away. Like we want so badly to make more money.

452
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 And yet all the things we buy, though they start with shine,

453
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,000
 eventually wear away and fade as the days grow long.

454
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
 We want that job. And yet here's the thing that's crazy.

455
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,300
 We're going to get that job and we're going to love that work.

456
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,000
 And yet when we retire, they're just going to backfill your position.

457
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,300
 No one will ever speak your name. Someone will actually do it better than you ever did.

458
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:10,200
 Like some of us, we want popularity. Like we want the world to look at us and know us and love us.

459
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,900
 And yet no one, though they may see you, actually knows you or actually loves you.

460
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,500
 So many of us are investing in things that do not matter,

461
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,300
 that don't go the distance, that will fade in time.

462
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,300
 And yet Jesus is standing here and he's looking at us and he's saying,

463
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,900
 I want something different for you. I want something better for you.

464
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,500
 Like I've got the kind of life you wouldn't believe.

465
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,400
 But here's the thing, before you can step into this life that matters,

466
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,900
 you've got to leave the life that doesn't matter.

467
00:31:52,900 --> 00:32:00,400
 You've got to drop your nets. That's exactly what Peter, James, John, and Andrew do.

468
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,900
 We see in verse 11, "And when they had brought their boats to land,

469
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,000
 they left everything and they followed him."

470
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
 So let's just play a hypothetical scenario in here.

471
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:22,100
 Say Taylor Swift or Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson or Justin Bieber or Jimmy Fallon or Blake Lively

472
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,400
 or your celebrity of choice comes to you and says,

473
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:36,000
 "Hey, I noticed you. I want you to come and follow me for the next year.

474
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,200
 You're going to have unprecedented access to me.

475
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,700
 Like you're going to get to go to the places I go and meet the people I meet

476
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,900
 and see the things I see and do the things I do.

477
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,300
 You're going to get to be a part of all of it.

478
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,700
 Sure, you're going to have to let some things go,

479
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,100
 but you're going to get so much more if you come."

480
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,100
 What's your response to that offer?

481
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,700
 When are we leaving? Tomorrow? I can pack tonight. I can get there.

482
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,200
 I'll make my way. I'll get an Uber. Like no, we all want to go.

483
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,800
 Like barring we have no outstanding circumstances, we want to be there.

484
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,700
 We want to go there. We want to hop in and ride off into the sunset

485
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,300
 with whoever our person of significance is.

486
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,600
 Like we want that sort of opportunity porch.

487
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,200
 Someone so much more significant has offered it to you.

488
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,900
 Jesus is looking at you and saying, "Follow me, not just for the next year,

489
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,800
 but for the rest of your life." Well, Jesus, what have you been a part of?

490
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,600
 I'm the son of God. I created the cosmos.

491
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,000
 I hold everything together. That's pretty good.

492
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,600
 You know, like that's someone that we should go with.

493
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,400
 That's someone we should hop in for.

494
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:53,300
 Jesus is looking at us and saying, "I will make you into something you wouldn't believe.

495
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,000
 I will lead you someplace you would never dream.

496
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,400
 But friend, you've got to follow me."

497
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,700
 Which tells us the last thing we need to know about discipleship.

498
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,100
 Nothing is worth keeping if it keeps us from Jesus.

499
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,300
 Nothing in the world is worth keeping if it keeps us from Jesus.

500
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:28,200
 And yet here's the thing, as I wrote that point into my notes, I just knew.

501
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:36,700
 As I say it to the crowd tonight and you hear that command.

502
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,300
 Some of you are going to be on the fence even still.

503
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,700
 Like even though the offer's been made, even though the invitation's been set,

504
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,600
 you're going to hear the opportunity at hand and you're going to say,

505
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:55,300
 "Man, that sounds nice." But isn't that offer always available?

506
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,400
 Like this isn't really a limited time thing.

507
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,500
 Like this isn't an invitation that actually expires.

508
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,400
 Like sure, I want to commit my life to following Jesus.

509
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,100
 Like there's going to come a day where I want to settle down

510
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
 and I want to have a wife or a husband and have some kids

511
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,000
 and raise a family and live in that neighborhood and plant some roots

512
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
 and be a contributor to the community.

513
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,800
 Like I want all of that stuff, but here's the thing, like I'm still in the prime of life.

514
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,300
 I'm still young and attractive and ambitious and adventurous.

515
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,700
 And I've got things that I want to do and places I want to go and people I want to see

516
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,500
 and joy I want to find. Like I've got a life right now that I want to live

517
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,000
 and I don't know that Jesus is going to give me the sort of tools

518
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 and guide and guard that's going to lead me into that sort of reality.

519
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,300
 I want that. I just don't want that right now.

520
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,000
 Friend, let me just tell you,

521
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,500
 if that's your response to the invitation that Jesus is putting in front of you,

522
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,800
 you're not costing Jesus anything by making him wait.

523
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,500
 But you are costing yourself everything at the same time.

524
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,700
 Like Jesus wants more for you than you want yourself.

525
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,300
 That's why he wants you to follow him. Today, tonight, right here in this moment,

526
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,800
 he wants you to come with him, not because he needs anything from you.

527
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
 I need you to tell me I'm awesome.

528
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,800
 No, he wants everything for you.

529
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,900
 That's his heart. And he's standing here this evening,

530
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,900
 not on the shore of Galilee, but on a stage in Dallas, Texas,

531
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,700
 simply saying, hey, come and follow me.

532
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,700
 I've got a life for you the likes of which you wouldn't dream.

533
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,300
 You couldn't cook up something better than I've got for you.

534
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,500
 Sure. It may be hard in this trouble, in this world, you will have trouble,

535
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,000
 but take heart. I've overcome the world and guess what? I'm with you.

536
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Let's go together. I've got something significant for you.

537
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And Porch, I'm praying. God, I am praying.

538
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We don't miss the offer while it still stands.

539
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,100
 I am praying you don't waste your life

540
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,800
 trying to figure out everything I'm saying is actually true.

541
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,600
 These men dropped everything to follow Jesus.

542
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,100
 More than the development that he promised or the destiny he could give.

543
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:34,300
 They saw the delight that he offered as a God come to them.

544
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,400
 You see, yes, Jesus wants to develop you.

545
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,500
 Yes, Jesus has a destiny for you,

546
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 but he is on his own eternally so sufficiently delightful.

547
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,900
 Like the life and the hope and the peace and the friendship

548
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,000
 and the joy that you long for in life.

549
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,700
 It's found in him, not found anywhere else.

550
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,600
 Sure, the world will offer and promise,

551
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
 but it will always under deliver in this way.

552
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,700
 Yet Jesus, he will deliver again and again and again.

553
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:15,400
 And yet here's the thing, though this delight stands ready for us tonight.

554
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,400
 We've got to drop our nets.

555
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,500
 Like whatever your safety net is, you got to let it down.

556
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,900
 You can't run forward while still holding back.

557
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,900
 You've got to drop whatever it is you're carrying.

558
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,200
 For some of us, that means you've got to drop the shame that you feel.

559
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,300
 You've got to drop the shame you have for that thing you did,

560
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,500
 that thing you said, that person you heard, that place you went.

561
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,400
 You've got to drop that shame. And I've heard some of the shame that you carry.

562
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,900
 And I know it feels like God, I can't let this go so easily.

563
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,500
 This defines me now. No, that shame does not define you.

564
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,500
 For that shame was left in the grave once Jesus rose forth from it.

565
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,400
 So you drop it and you leave it where he left it himself.

566
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 Others of you, you need to drop your anger.

567
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
 Someone did you wrong. Someone hurt you bad.

568
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 Someone took something from you that they had no business taking.

569
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,900
 And yet Jesus, if you will only drop that anger,

570
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,500
 will give to you joy like you would not know elsewhere.

571
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
 Some of you need to drop envy.

572
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,600
 You need to let go all the bitterness you hold with other people

573
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,500
 because they have the things that you want.

574
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,600
 And you've tried not just as hard, but even harder than they have to get where they are.

575
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,100
 And yet you need to drop the fact that you think you deserve that

576
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,000
 and you need to trust Jesus instead that he will take you where it is.

577
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,700
 Not just you want to go, he wants you to go in his own time.

578
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,100
 Some of you need to drop your relationship.

579
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,100
 Though you love that person and they have some redeeming qualities,

580
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,600
 you know that the two of you together are not godly

581
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,300
 and the two of you towards one another are not good.

582
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,900
 It's toxic. And it's time to drop it and let it go.

583
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,600
 Others of you need to drop your addiction.

584
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,600
 Look, I'm not too naive to know that there are people in here that wrestle with pornography,

585
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,700
 that wrestle with alcohol, that wrestle with marijuana,

586
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:29,300
 that wrestle with scrolling, that wrestle with whatever because you're coping.

587
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,500
 Listen, man, I don't blame you. I've been there.

588
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,400
 I'm not looking at you saying you're crazy.

589
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,900
 But I am looking at you and saying, he's better.

590
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,100
 He can give you whatever you think that thing can.

591
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:52,200
 He can satisfy you not just as much but so much more than any bottle,

592
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,400
 than any screen, than any pill. You're coping because you want joy.

593
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,200
 You want to feel something real, something good.

594
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,200
 It's here tonight. And he never runs out.

595
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,700
 He never runs empty. Some of you need to drop your control.

596
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,300
 Your need to like make things happen the way you want. To get there whenever it is you want.

597
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,900
 To arrive on your own schedule like you need to drop that.

598
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:34,500
 And you need to trust. That though you may feel insecure circumstantially,

599
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,200
 you are totally secure spiritually. He's got you.

600
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,000
 He's not going to let you go. Some of us need to drop the image that you're so desperate to keep.

601
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,500
 Man, I've spent too much time around the church and around church people.

602
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,700
 To know that so many of us pride ourselves on looking a certain way.

603
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,100
 On retaining that kind of reputation. On having that sort of character.

604
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:09,700
 And we are fearful that anything would ever happen to hurt the image we have worked so hard to build.

605
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,400
 So desperate to keep it, are we, that we would conceal our sin.

606
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,400
 We would hide our shame. We would stiff arm people and keep them at bay.

607
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,300
 Because we, we want to look a certain way, be perceived a certain way, received a certain way.

608
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,600
 You got to drop that. Because it's only robbing you of life.

609
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,500
 Some of you need to drop the future you're so desperate to find.

610
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,400
 Because Jesus has a better future for you.

611
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:48,200
 You know, the question as we think about Jesus is not what one pastor said.

612
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:57,400
 Do I want heaven over hell? The question Jesus is putting before you is, do you want heaven over earth?

613
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,900
 Like, do you want heaven? Do you want Jesus? Do you want eternity?

614
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,900
 Do you want everlasting life and all the joy and satisfaction that's found therein?

615
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:15,400
 Or do you just want the things of this world? Those things which, and they feel good for a moment.

616
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,500
 But they do not last. They will in fact fade. And they will run dry.

617
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,700
 Jesus is sitting here tonight and he's looking at you and saying, drop it all.

618
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,400
 Leave it here. Don't take it out into the city with you.

619
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,200
 Leave it tonight. Because I came to turn failures into followers.

620
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,500
 So much so that I gave my life to save you.

621
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,000
 I came to unlock all of your potential. And that comes by way of new perspective.

622
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 That perspective is found not just in the death I died,

623
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,700
 but the resurrection I rose so that as I rise to heaven and I sit next to the Father,

624
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,200
 you can rise alongside me. If only you place your faith in me.

625
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,400
 There's potential in you. I see it. You can be like me.

626
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,600
 Just place your faith and let's go. Let's move forward.

627
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,800
 He wants you to know man, nothing is worth keeping if it keeps you from me.

628
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,200
 Because I was willing to give everything to get to you.

629
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:18,700
 Porch, won't you drop everything and follow him? Because he dropped everything to find you.

630
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,600
 Let me pray for us. Father, we love you.

631
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,700
 I'm grateful for an evening like this.

632
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,900
 Thankful for your word and the sufficiency of it.

633
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,100
 And the fact that God, it speaks to a wide array of people.

634
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,200
 So many, so many stories, so many histories,

635
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,500
 so many situations and circumstances all across this room.

636
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:45,600
 And the truth of your word applies to all of us. God, I beg you.

637
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,400
 Would you work in this next moment? Would you stir in our souls?

638
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,400
 Would you lead us to a place of radical response?

639
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,700
 Where we've heard the gospel, we have seen the invitation,

640
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,300
 and now God, I pray we would reach out with arms extended to take the invite from you,

641
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,200
 to receive the offer you've given, to accept the gift you give by placing our faith in you.

642
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,400
 We love you. And it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
