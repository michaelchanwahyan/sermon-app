1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - 108 verses, 54 of them are imperatives.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,140
 An imperative is a command.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,720
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:20,980
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother,

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,060
 he was his Lord.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,680
 - What's up, guys?

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,400
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,520
 Hey, welcome, friends in the room

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,940
 and in Scottsdale, Arizona, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa,

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,960
 Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Phoenix, Arizona, Fayetteville,

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,060
 Arkansas, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas,

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,900
 wherever you are joining in from and anybody online,

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,240
 we are continuing this series in the book of James,

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,280
 where we are looking at for the next handful of weeks

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,200
 and really the previous handful of weeks,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,640
 listening to the half-brother of Jesus

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,880
 on some of the 14 topics that he covered.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,120
 And we're gonna launch into another one of them tonight.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,560
 I've got a two-year-old daughter whose name is Monroe.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,800
 And one thing that we started doing

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,000
 during shelter-in-place quarantine

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,860
 was we had this creek by our house

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,840
 that we would go down to

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,560
 and we would just throw rocks in the creek.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,000
 I think we even have a picture either of her or even,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
 oh, there she is.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,960
 Oh, man, she's just the best.

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 Oh, she can't say her R's or her W's.

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
 So when she says, "We're going to the creek,"

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,560
 it's, "We're going to the queek, we're going to the queek."

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
 And her brother corrects her.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
 And I'm like, "Man, I will spank you

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,600
 if you correct her again."

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,480
 I hope she's 16 saying, "I'm going to the queek."

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,040
 And anyway, so we'll go down there.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,640
 And what we'll do, it's not exactly,

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,360
 it's actually, I think, like a sewage run,

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,480
 but it looks like a creek.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,940
 And we'll go and we will throw rocks

40
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,320
 into this little like pond, creek thing that is there.

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,160
 And they just love it.

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,480
 They could do it all day.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 And anytime now that we see or pass a rock anywhere,

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,440
 including here at Watermark,

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,640
 she wants to collect them and put them in her pockets

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,440
 to bring them to go throw at the queek.

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,740
 And so we'll walk around.

48
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,800
 I mean, true story, anywhere.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920
 We're at her little brother's baseball game.

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,120
 She goes over, she like finds a rock in the corner.

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
 She's like, "I'm putting it in my pocket for the queek."

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
 And then she'll run out of space in her pocket.

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,080
 So I'll find in her laundry, all kinds of rocks.

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
 She puts them in our pockets.

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
 We just have rocks.

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,160
 True story, I got these from the laundry room

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
 this morning, today, because she will just load up.

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,800
 Because anytime she sees a rock, it doesn't matter the size,

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
 doesn't matter how colorful it is,

60
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,000
 doesn't matter how big or small,

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 it is a potential source of something

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,820
 to throw in the creek.

63
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,800
 They're all incredibly valuable to her.

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
 So wherever she finds them,

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,940
 she is gonna take them to use them.

66
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,880
 What does that have to do

67
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,720
 with what we're talking about tonight?

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
 Well, tonight we're gonna talk about the subject

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,460
 of favoritism.

70
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,440
 And in that scenario, my daughter looks at every single rock

71
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
 that exists on planet earth and is like,

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
 "This all has value because it's something that I can take

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
 and go with my brother to throw in the creek."

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
 And when the scriptures talk about how you and I

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
 are to look at one another,

76
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,080
 it is to the command that you are to see

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,040
 every person you've ever met, Christian, non-Christian,

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 old, black, white, brown, age, gender,

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,480
 as someone who is of incredible value.

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,640
 Favoritism, by definition, is treating someone differently,

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
 thinking about someone differently,

82
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 saying or speaking to someone differently

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,440
 based on how you perceive them, how you think about them.

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,120
 And the scripture says,

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,360
 "This can be a source of tremendous division

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
 and is something that God hates

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,200
 and is a sin that's not to take place inside of the church."

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,840
 Now, just to get us going, in case you're like,

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
 "Man, do I really do that?

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,220
 'Cause I think most people walk in the room like,

91
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,800
 "Oh, great, talking about favoritism,

92
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
 partiality, not my struggle."

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,320
 I think in general, all of us, all the time,

94
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
 are processing information

95
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,040
 and we are based on our preferences

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
 determining how we're gonna interact with that thing.

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
 It doesn't even have to do with people.

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 Let me use an example.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,080
 Any dog people in this room?

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,900
 Dog moms?

101
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,740
 There you go.

102
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,200
 Any cat people?

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
 (audience cheering)

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,280
 Like, you are dismissed.

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,240
 And I'm totally kidding.

106
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
 I'm totally kidding.

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,760
 All right, think about, if you are a dog person,

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,400
 you walk into the dog room, no offense,

109
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,500
 and you walk in, somebody's got a dog,

110
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,180
 and they're there, and you walk in

111
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,020
 and you haven't met them before,

112
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,120
 but the dog's there, they look friendly,

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,160
 you go up, you're just gonna pet 'em,

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
 and especially if you're a dog person,

115
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
 like, "Oh, this is great."

116
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
 You walk into somebody's house and they have a cat,

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,480
 if the cat approaches you, it's like,

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
 "What is going on right now?"

119
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,840
 And if it comes up and begins to paw

120
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
 or like jump at you like a dog would,

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,400
 you're like, "Okay, this is not okay."

122
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,320
 Like, they're just supposed to kind of scurry by themselves

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,080
 and run off, and I don't know what cats do.

124
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,480
 But in that moment, based on your preferences,

125
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
 it's influencing and impacting how you behave.

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,020
 Here's another silly one.

127
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,140
 Someone's type of phone will impact

128
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,740
 how you think about that person.

129
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,000
 There are people out there called Android users,

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,100
 and they make every text group green.

131
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,100
 And you just got their digits, or you connected,

132
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,740
 and you got their number, and you go to text them,

133
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,580
 you're like, "Hey, what's going on,

134
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,940
 "or what do you got going on this weekend?"

135
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,340
 And then all of a sudden, a color pops up, boom,

136
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,900
 and it's green, and you're like, "Oh, man."

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,440
 (audience laughing)

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,200
 Maybe, maybe it's just like they're out of Wi-Fi

139
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,100
 right now or something, and the next one will go through,

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,580
 and it doesn't go through, it's still green,

141
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,480
 and we can't name our text messages groups because of you.

142
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,260
 And you go begin to process through like,

143
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,860
 "Oh, man, I didn't see you for an Android person.

144
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,240
 "Interesting, that is interesting."

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,880
 And not just that, it impacts how we interact

146
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,760
 with each other, especially people of the opposite sex.

147
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,840
 If there's a girl that you find attractive,

148
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,280
 or a guy that you find attractive, it's going to impact,

149
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,400
 it's just human nature, how you interact with that person.

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,220
 You're gonna be more curious, asking questions,

151
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,700
 you're kinda bumping up, and like,

152
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
 "Oh, hey, what's going on over there?"

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,900
 And you're just dialoguing in the conversation,

154
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,020
 versus oftentimes, if you're not,

155
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,560
 you're just kinda moving about your way,

156
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,280
 and he's not that into you, and you are impacted

157
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
 based on how you perceive or how you think about someone,

158
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,860
 how your preferences impact.

159
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,080
 And what becomes tragic is whenever our preferences

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,200
 or the way that I think about someone,

161
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,920
 based on where they're from, what college they went to,

162
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,520
 what education they have, what family they grew up in,

163
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,440
 good or bad, when I allow that to ascribe

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,960
 or begin to associate value,

165
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 or how valuable or not valuable that person is,

166
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
 it becomes incredibly catastrophic.

167
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,480
 And so we're gonna talk what James has to say

168
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,220
 about the subject of how you and I are to treat one another,

169
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,780
 and how you and I are to treat every person,

170
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,560
 just in general.

171
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 The reason I think this issue is such a huge one,

172
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,600
 think about how much a person's identity,

173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,960
 their gender, their age, their ethnicity,

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,660
 is constantly being thrown in front of all of us,

175
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,080
 constantly thrown in front of all of us

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,980
 in a way that is oftentimes incredibly divisive.

177
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,940
 And the body of Christ, unlike any other group of people

178
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,260
 on the planet, is to be a group that is united,

179
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,840
 not because we are uniform in how we look,

180
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,720
 but because we are united through Jesus to one another.

181
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,400
 And James said, "If that mentality,

182
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,580
 "if I treat you different because you look this way,

183
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,140
 "or you are this way, or you have this,

184
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,080
 "you have begun to step into a serious sin

185
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
 "that God despises."

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,640
 So we're gonna be, in James chapter two,

187
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
 if you have a Bible, you can flip open there,

188
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
 if not, it'll be up on the screens.

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
 But we're gonna walk through three things.

190
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,320
 The command that James gives as it relates to favoritism,

191
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,640
 the cause of that favoritism, and then the cure

192
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,440
 for how you and I can experience freedom from that.

193
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
 James, if you haven't been tuning in,

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
 is the half-brother of Jesus.

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,600
 So Jesus grew up, had a little brother who saw him,

196
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
 likely shared a room with him,

197
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,520
 just 'cause everybody shared one room,

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
 and he likely saw the journey of his brother

199
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,480
 that ended with him on the cross and resurrecting.

200
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
 And after the resurrection, James came to faith,

201
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,320
 and he writes this book covering all types of things

202
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
 he learned from his baby brother,

203
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,160
 or from his older brother, Jesus.

204
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
 We've covered trials week one, temptation week two,

205
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
 last week, living according to your word,

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
 and tonight, we're gonna cover how you and I,

207
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
 the body of Christ, has no favorites.

208
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,560
 There are no favorites that should mark our life,

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,040
 and how we interact and treat one another.

210
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,380
 He says this, verse one.

211
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,040
 "My brothers and sisters,

212
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,840
 "believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ

213
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,840
 "must not show favoritism."

214
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,880
 In other words, or by favoritism,

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 I mean ascribing value based on my preferences,

216
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,460
 treating someone based on how my preferences

217
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,800
 or how I think about that person differently

218
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,880
 than I would someone else.

219
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,680
 And then he gives an illustration.

220
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,880
 He says, "Suppose a man comes into your meeting,

221
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
 "comes into church, he's wearing a gold ring

222
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,820
 "and fine clothes, and a poor man comes in,

223
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,760
 "and he's wearing filthy old clothes.

224
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
 "If you show special attention

225
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,380
 "to the man wearing fine clothes,

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,820
 "and you say, 'Here's a good seat for you,'

227
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,080
 "but you say to the poor man, 'You stand over there,

228
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,200
 "'you sit on the floor by my feet,'

229
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,820
 "have you not discriminated among yourselves

230
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,000
 "and become judges with evil thoughts?"

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
 So he brings up the subject of favoritism.

232
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,600
 He says, "Among Christians, this should not ever take place,"

233
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,280
 showing preferential treatment to people.

234
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
 And he gives an illustration.

235
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,680
 And a gold ring in that day and age

236
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,760
 would have been very unique.

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,040
 It basically would be like the equivalent.

238
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,980
 And today, he'd be like, "Look, imagine a guy shows up,

239
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,680
 "he's got the Gucci buckle on,

240
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,020
 "or he's walking in with Yeezys on,

241
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,960
 "or he's driving a G-Wagon here,

242
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
 "and he's just got some look that gives away."

243
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,260
 Or a girl that shows up, she's wearing a,

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,120
 I don't know what girls wear.

245
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,900
 She's wearing golden goose shoes and a Birkin bag.

246
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,440
 Let me just take a side note here.

247
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,380
 When did we start making clothes

248
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,820
 that looked intentionally all nasty and tatted up and dirty?

249
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
 Literally, they came out of goodwill or something,

250
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,460
 and then we start selling them for $500.

251
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,500
 That concept, I just still can't get my mind around

252
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,380
 called golden goose.

253
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,420
 Men, if you don't know what that is, look around,

254
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,660
 and the tattiest, most tattered pair of shoes

255
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,380
 you probably see on a girl's feet are probably the O's

256
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,540
 and also the most expensive.

257
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,440
 Anyways, point being, just fashion right now, man.

258
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
 I just don't get it.

259
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,100
 Point being, this person shows up,

260
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,400
 and inside of the church, and then there's somebody

261
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,440
 who shows up, and the word that's used to describe him

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
 is he's dirty, he's stinky.

263
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,060
 It's a word that's synonymous with excrement,

264
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,720
 so he is dirty, and he's inside of the church,

265
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,620
 and then you've got this guy, gold ring,

266
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,740
 or wearing whatever duds today would make sense,

267
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,040
 and the word that is used for the guy wearing the gold ring

268
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,460
 is literally a word that means shiny, which is so great.

269
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,840
 I feel like there's a rap song

270
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,900
 that could have been made off of this.

271
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,940
 I am shiny, and there's a shiny guy, dirty guy,

272
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,380
 and he leads into,

273
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,100
 "When you begin to show preferential treatment

274
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,780
 "based on external appearance, based on how someone looks,

275
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,900
 "you have stepped into favoritism and sin,

276
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,520
 "whether for good or for bad."

277
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,280
 And he says, "Among the people of God,

278
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,060
 "this should not be present."

279
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,500
 So the first idea is the command, do not show favoritism.

280
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,660
 It's crazy how often, just human nature, we do this,

281
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,920
 where we see somebody,

282
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,460
 and you immediately begin to size them up,

283
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,700
 and you immediately begin to go through,

284
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,340
 and you're talking to them, and you learn more information,

285
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,820
 and you just run through the Rolodex

286
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,140
 of how important they are, how significant they are,

287
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,060
 how you're gonna think about them,

288
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,660
 and even how you're gonna interact or treat them.

289
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
 What do I mean by this?

290
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,100
 Tonight, afterwards, you're gonna be out in the lobby,

291
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,140
 you're gonna be talking to somebody.

292
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,060
 Let me tell you what the person

293
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,100
 on the other end of that conversation is gonna be doing.

294
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,440
 You're gonna meet them for the first time,

295
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,780
 they're gonna say, "Oh, man, how did you hear

296
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,820
 "about the porch?"

297
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,980
 And they're just beginning the computing.

298
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,860
 It's like they're Iron Man,

299
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,020
 seeing the stats that pop up as you tell your life.

300
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,500
 And they're like, "Well, my friend invited me."

301
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,420
 And they're like, "Oh, interesting,

302
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,540
 "friends that are connected to each other.

303
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,500
 "Where'd you go to college?"

304
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,620
 And their facial expression may not change that much,

305
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,380
 and they'll walk through, "Hey, where do you work?"

306
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,300
 And you respond with, "Well, I'm a teacher,

307
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,260
 "or I'm in law school, or I work at Deloitte."

308
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,180
 And again, they're sizing up, how important is this person?

309
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,200
 "Where'd you go to college?"

310
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,540
 "Oh, big one right here."

311
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,000
 "Well, I went to Texas Tech."

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,300
 "Must be a part of your, oh, I went to TCU."

313
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,100
 "Bro comes from some money."

314
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,060
 "Oh, I went to Harvard, woo, cha-ching."

315
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,580
 And they're just sizing up one thing after the next,

316
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,140
 after the next, after the next.

317
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,300
 "What are you doing after this?"

318
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,280
 "Well, I'm going to hang out with a couple friends."

319
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,140
 "Is one of them a girl?"

320
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
 And you're just going through like,

321
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,300
 "I wonder if he's single, is he not?"

322
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,660
 And they're just categorizing,

323
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,660
 and we just begin to ascribe and associate value,

324
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,460
 and that impacts how we're gonna treat that other person.

325
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,220
 Some of you, candidly, like you do this,

326
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,620
 and you do it in the negative way,

327
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,300
 where it wouldn't be somebody that shows up

328
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,540
 in poor, shabby clothes to you.

329
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,500
 There's just people you don't like for whatever reason,

330
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,380
 and it's sin.

331
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,380
 Like, some of you guys, you don't like artsy guys.

332
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,220
 Like, you don't like artistic people,

333
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,100
 you're just like, "They're just weird, just don't get it."

334
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,540
 You think it's for whatever reason, you don't like it.

335
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,820
 Some of you guys don't like athletic guys,

336
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,380
 'cause you're like, "Oh my gosh, yeah, barbell.

337
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,380
 "I'm so over it, it's so annoying."

338
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,900
 And it's sin.

339
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,980
 And you kind of exclude and you treat people different,

340
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,900
 and you judge them based on external appearances.

341
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,740
 You don't know anything about them.

342
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,940
 Some of you girls, you don't like skinny girls.

343
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,340
 And you get around them, and you're like,

344
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,660
 you immediately rub them off, unless you get to know 'em.

345
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,100
 You're like, "I can't believe it, oh my gosh.

346
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,820
 "I would never wanna look like that.

347
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,800
 "I mean, size two, that's gotta be horrible,

348
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,220
 "and this is unbelievable that she thinks

349
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
 "she can join our party."

350
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,160
 And you don't like 'em.

351
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,500
 There's people who, because of the car that they drive,

352
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,060
 you immediately judge and think of them differently,

353
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,340
 for better or for worse.

354
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,780
 This can also happen where you begin

355
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,900
 to show preferential treatment,

356
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,020
 in terms of the girl or guy you're dating,

357
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,740
 on really superficial, shallow things.

358
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,560
 Like, "Oh, he's a doctor."

359
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,220
 And that becomes the thing that makes you go,

360
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,340
 "Oh, I'm interested."

361
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,740
 And James would say, "The way that you see people

362
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,800
 "is off, and it's Christians.

363
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,980
 "We're not to see one another through the lens

364
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,160
 "of how the world sees us, or a value

365
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,640
 "that is a moving target, based on what

366
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,800
 "the world says matters.

367
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,940
 "We are to see people entirely differently than that."

368
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,580
 And we're about to cover exactly what I mean by that.

369
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,800
 Some of you think, so I'm gonna lean,

370
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,260
 the most important thing about a person is their ethnicity.

371
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,820
 Let me be abundantly clear.

372
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,900
 A person's ethnicity, whether it's the,

373
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,140
 "Here I am, and I'm so proud of this,"

374
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,980
 or "Here I am, and I hold that against that person

375
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,020
 "because they're of a different one,"

376
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,300
 compared to where they will spend eternity,

377
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,460
 does not matter at all.

378
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,780
 Let me say that again.

379
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,820
 The most significant thing about someone

380
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,020
 is where they will spend eternity, not their ethnicity.

381
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,380
 That doesn't mean they can't celebrate,

382
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,820
 or have ancestral heritage, or anything that they

383
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,380
 are thankful for that is in their life.

384
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,020
 But when it comes to how you see yourself,

385
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,760
 how you see other people, it is a sick, toxic thing

386
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,440
 to think that if you are a sister and brother in Christ,

387
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,840
 you have a deeper connection to someone

388
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,440
 who shares your skin color than who shares

389
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,560
 the fact that you are related to Jesus

390
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
 and will be with them for all of eternity.

391
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,840
 And you don't have to believe me now

392
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,040
 'cause you're gonna be together with whatever race you are,

393
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
 ethnicity you are, we're gonna be together

394
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,200
 for all of eternity, so you'll get there someday

395
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,440
 if you don't believe me now.

396
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,640
 But the most important thing about someone

397
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,320
 is not the amount of melanin in their skin.

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
 It's crazy.

399
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,280
 And that type of thinking, when it seeps into the church,

400
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
 is toxic, and James would say,

401
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,320
 if you treat people differently based on how they look,

402
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,520
 for better or for worse, it is sin.

403
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 And I know in the room, there's people who probably are like,

404
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
 I can't believe you're, you don't have the right to say this

405
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,960
 'cause honestly, David, you're just some white guy

406
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
 standing up there telling me that.

407
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,720
 I don't care.

408
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,080
 The most important thing about you, you need to know.

409
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,320
 It's not the color of your skin.

410
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,720
 It's where you're gonna spend eternity.

411
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
 It's a very relevant thing to your life

412
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,640
 and all of our lives, but it's not the most important thing.

413
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,120
 And if you, conversely, if you think less of somebody

414
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
 because of their ethnicity,

415
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,400
 if you think less of somebody because they're Asian

416
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,720
 or because they're black or because they're brown

417
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,960
 or because they're white,

418
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,920
 you are doing the exact thing that James said.

419
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,440
 You're not to look at external appearances

420
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,680
 to form how you see someone.

421
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,840
 And this happens on all sides.

422
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,000
 Do I need to lean in even more here?

423
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,360
 And James says it is wrong.

424
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,920
 If you look at somebody based on how much money

425
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,320
 that they make and you ascribe value, it's sin.

426
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,200
 And you don't see like God sees.

427
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,360
 Further, inside of the church,

428
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,440
 this has never, ever been okay.

429
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,320
 To divide one another or to see one another

430
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,600
 or to focus on the differences

431
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,920
 and judge one another through that lens is tragic.

432
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,480
 And the church has not always gotten this right,

433
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,880
 but it has always been called to

434
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,080
 because God doesn't see the way that we see.

435
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,880
 In the 1950s, there was a guy named Billy Graham

436
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,160
 who led a bunch of crusades.

437
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,880
 He went all over the country, all over the world.

438
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,680
 He preached to more people in his lifetime

439
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,800
 than any other person who's ever lived.

440
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,680
 Millions and millions of people.

441
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,000
 In the 1950s, it was at the heart of a racial divide

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,280
 and tension in our nation that was enormous.

443
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,680
 Segregation was legal.

444
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,000
 Jim Crow was legal.

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,360
 And Billy Graham would go on crusades.

446
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,160
 In 1953, in Chattanooga, Tennessee,

447
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,080
 he showed up at a church.

448
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,920
 He went inside the church

449
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
 and he was there to preach a crusade.

450
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,360
 And he walked in and they had ropes

451
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,680
 that were dividing and segregating

452
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,440
 where different people based on their color

453
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,600
 would be able to sit.

454
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,360
 And Billy went up to those ropes and said,

455
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,040
 "You either lose the ropes or you're gonna lose me.

456
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,080
 "You either take these away or I'm going away."

457
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
 And they took him down.

458
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,840
 And they did not tolerate.

459
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,080
 This is where the people of God come together

460
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,360
 and they stand level at the foot of the cross.

461
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,760
 Any Christian in history who has not agreed with that

462
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,360
 is wrong and in sin.

463
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,200
 Mahatma Gandhi was a really influential figure

464
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
 in the 20th century.

465
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,640
 One of the most influential of all time.

466
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,520
 Tragically, he experienced something very different

467
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,360
 in his exposure to Christianity.

468
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,280
 He writes in an autobiography about his experience

469
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,000
 and exposure to the church.

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
 And he was studying and he was in college

471
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
 and he writes that he was studying Christianity.

472
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,720
 And man, it's so powerful what he writes.

473
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,240
 He basically says, when he was studying the gospels,

474
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,320
 he seriously considered converting to Christianity.

475
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
 I believe that the teachings of Jesus

476
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,520
 could find the solution to the caste system

477
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,600
 that was dividing the people of India.

478
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,440
 In other words, India, there's this caste system

479
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,400
 and based on kind of what caste or what group that you're in

480
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,520
 determines your life and where you can go in society

481
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 and laws that are applied to you.

482
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,160
 And he read the teachings of Jesus in the Bible

483
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,360
 and he thought, man, if anybody can break down walls,

484
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,520
 it is this man.

485
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,760
 These teachings may be able to transform India

486
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,840
 from what it is today and break down the caste system.

487
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,320
 And he says, he went to a church.

488
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,080
 One Sunday, I decided to attend services

489
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
 at a nearby church and talk to the minister

490
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
 about becoming a Christian.

491
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,280
 When he entered the sanctuary, however,

492
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,200
 the usher refused to give him a seat

493
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 and suggested that he go back and worship

494
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,080
 with his own people.

495
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,880
 Gandhi says, I left the church that morning,

496
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
 disillusioned, disappointment.

497
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,760
 I decided not to return to a Christian church again

498
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,320
 saying if Christians have their own caste systems

499
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,560
 and play favoritism, I might as well remain a Hindu.

500
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,200
 Think about the tragedy that was.

501
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,280
 Someone who impacted millions and millions of people

502
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,360
 who had come and attempted and interested

503
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,240
 in becoming a Christian,

504
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,960
 turned away for something as silly as a Christian.

505
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
 For something as silly as the color of his skin

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,080
 or where he was from.

507
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,920
 Can you imagine God in heaven when he looks down

508
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,480
 seeing all things for all of eternity

509
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,280
 who made every single one of us in his image?

510
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,520
 Saying, really?

511
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,360
 Because he's got less or more melanin than you,

512
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,560
 that's how you're gonna divide things?

513
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,080
 That's so insane.

514
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,960
 In any way that this line of thinking,

515
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,720
 whether it's around ethnicity or it's around

516
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,440
 where someone went to college or their background

517
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
 or their education level begins to creep into the church,

518
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,200
 it's toxic, it's sick, it's sin, and it is evil, James says.

519
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,280
 Comes from an evil place.

520
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,840
 That's what he says in the verse.

521
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,880
 So he gives the command and then he gives the cause.

522
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,480
 Says this, my dear brothers and sisters,

523
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,500
 has not God chosen those who are poor

524
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
 in this world to be rich in faith?

525
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,720
 He's quoting from the Sermon on the Mount.

526
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,320
 Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit,

527
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
 "for they shall inherit the earth."

528
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,560
 To inherit the kingdom, he's promised to those who love him.

529
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,440
 He didn't promise it to the poor,

530
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
 he promised it to those who love him.

531
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
 But you have dishonored the poor.

532
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,920
 Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?

533
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,560
 So he's talking about a group of people

534
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,520
 who weren't believers that were exploiting

535
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,000
 some of the more poor Christians.

536
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,600
 Are they not the ones dragging you in court?

537
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,920
 Are they not the ones blaspheming the noble name

538
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
 of him to whom you belong?

539
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,160
 So he brings up the point, and the point is not rich or poor.

540
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 His point is, hey, it's those who love him

541
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,080
 who will inherit the kingdom.

542
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
 His point is, you see people wrongly.

543
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
 You see people based on this earthly, worldly perspective

544
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,840
 where you see you got poor people, you got rich people.

545
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,020
 God doesn't see like that.

546
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,760
 God doesn't see through the lens and the spectrum

547
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,800
 of the way that the world sees around us.

548
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,120
 There are poor people in this world

549
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,140
 who will live in poverty their entire life.

550
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,500
 Some of them will live in third world countries

551
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,880
 their entire life who will spend eternity

552
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,320
 as billionaire, billionaire, billionaires.

553
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,280
 Maybe it's some of the wealthiest people you have ever met

554
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
 or some of the most blue-collar, just faithful servants

555
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,040
 of God that you've bumped into who love Jesus.

556
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 And there are billionaires in this world

557
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,240
 who will be bankrupt for all of eternity in hell.

558
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,600
 And James is saying, God doesn't see through the lens.

559
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,760
 Everything that you think is important,

560
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,400
 God doesn't think is important.

561
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,160
 All the way that you treat people based on these

562
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,920
 superficial, silly, dumb things

563
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,920
 or insignificant in the eternal perspective things.

564
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,280
 He doesn't see people like the way that you see them.

565
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,400
 And you are not to treat people

566
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,880
 because the reason that you and I treat people differently

567
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,960
 is we don't see as God sees.

568
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
 So we hold onto things that he would say

569
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,360
 it's just not important.

570
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,280
 Every single person you've ever met

571
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,040
 is someone of infinite value.

572
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,240
 Someone who the angels long to look into

573
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,960
 and see that person come to church.

574
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,440
 First Corinthians six says that humans

575
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,760
 will judge the angels someday.

576
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,600
 Think about that.

577
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,040
 The angelic realm looks at you

578
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
 if you're a follower of Christ

579
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,680
 and the wonder and the glory that awaits you

580
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,440
 makes them awe or sit in long to look in

581
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,360
 is what first Peter two says.

582
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,200
 Long to see.

583
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,680
 You have no idea how infinitely value you are

584
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,200
 in every person you've ever met.

585
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,880
 The infinite value and potential that they have

586
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,720
 is someone who's made in the image of God.

587
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,260
 A future daughter or son of God almighty.

588
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,540
 I mean, think about that.

589
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,780
 If we could for a second see how valuable,

590
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,500
 how every single person you've ever,

591
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,580
 the person who bagged your groceries,

592
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,140
 the person that's gonna wait your table at Torchy's

593
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
 after this or pick up your table at Torchy's after this,

594
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,020
 the person that you live next to,

595
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,380
 the person that is in the cube next to you,

596
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,420
 your boss, every one of them

597
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,300
 is someone of literally infinite value

598
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,460
 because Jesus was willing to die on the cross

599
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,900
 to give his eternal life for that person.

600
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,900
 And it's crazy, like if Tim Tebow was here tonight

601
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,840
 or whatever the girl equivalent of that is,

602
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,780
 there would be a huge line of people waiting.

603
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,420
 They're like, oh man, I wanna take a picture of Tim Tebow.

604
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,600
 Look, Tim Tebow.

605
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,420
 And again, whatever the girl equivalent of that is,

606
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,460
 because you'd wanna meet and see and be around that person.

607
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,400
 Every person you're around

608
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,660
 is of such infinite, extraordinary value

609
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,460
 because they're made in the image of God,

610
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,820
 regardless of what they can do

611
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,620
 with a ball made out of pigskin sewn together.

612
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,580
 They're of infinite value

613
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,860
 because they're someone that Jesus said,

614
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,220
 I love them so much, I died for them.

615
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,580
 Every person you've ever been eyeball to eyeball with

616
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,380
 is gonna spend eternity somewhere,

617
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,220
 either perfected and glorified with Jesus

618
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,180
 or in hell apart from.

619
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,260
 And that same wonder that you would have

620
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,880
 of I can't believe I get to meet that person,

621
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,180
 you should know that is what every person around you

622
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,460
 ever is.

623
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,620
 Uniquely in all creation, God made a lot of cool stuff.

624
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,380
 He made the Aurora Borealis,

625
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,180
 He made the Grand Canyon, He made oceans,

626
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,460
 He made all kinds of cool stuff.

627
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,260
 None of that stuff makes God say,

628
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,360
 whoa, this is the crown of my creation.

629
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,860
 None of that stuff did He give His life for.

630
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,580
 You, on the other hand,

631
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,460
 you're the one that He says, man,

632
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,000
 you're the apple of my eye, so to speak,

633
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,940
 the most valuable thing that could ever be,

634
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,640
 both for you and for every person you've ever disrespected,

635
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,100
 treated poorly, ignored, ghosted,

636
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,880
 and not seen as God sees.

637
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,920
 And He says, man, you gotta understand

638
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,620
 and see people differently.

639
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,760
 Some of you, when you think through the lens of dating,

640
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,340
 it's so relevant to dating 'cause you're like,

641
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,740
 oh, you just see, like, man, he's got a trust fund,

642
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,940
 or she's got a trust fund,

643
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,180
 or I'm marrying into this really nice family.

644
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,860
 And there are people who are gonna be married

645
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,000
 and rich in this life.

646
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,700
 And people get married 'cause they're concerned

647
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,120
 about how much is in their bank account.

648
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,100
 They're not concerned about how much of God has their heart,

649
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,200
 or how much money they have in the bank

650
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
 versus how much God has of them.

651
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,140
 And when you make that deal and you take that bet

652
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,360
 for superficial, shallow, worldly reasons, it's costly.

653
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,600
 And James says, that's not how people who know Jesus think.

654
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,580
 The idea of the image of God,

655
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,900
 I've referenced already several times,

656
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,060
 but Genesis chapter one, verse 26 and 27 says,

657
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,620
 "So He created mankind in His own image.

658
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,980
 "In the image of God, He created the male and female."

659
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,840
 And James says, man, you're looking at people.

660
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,780
 Don't see them through the worldly lens that you're seeing.

661
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,660
 Looks can be deceiving.

662
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,900
 There's a bit on Jimmy Kimmel Live

663
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,980
 where he has Drake and Miley Cyrus

664
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,420
 and different people come out and they do eyewitness news.

665
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,780
 And I think we may have a pic of it,

666
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,500
 where this is Drake in undercover

667
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,860
 and he's out interviewing people.

668
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,860
 It's honestly a genius bit 'cause he goes out

669
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,220
 and he's totally undercover and he just dogs Drake.

670
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,980
 He's like, man, what do you think about Drake?

671
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,100
 He's pretty terrible, huh?

672
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,360
 And the guy just goes back and forth.

673
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,540
 And the people are like, yeah, man, I've never liked him.

674
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
 And I can't believe you did that.

675
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,900
 And honestly, this dude has not got talent.

676
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
 That's a problem.

677
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,100
 And he's like, yeah, yeah, man, no talent.

678
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,020
 That guy needs to find another hobby or something.

679
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,000
 And he walks through all of that.

680
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,620
 And then at the end, he takes off the mask

681
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,400
 and the guy realizes who I thought I was talking to

682
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,120
 was not who I was talking to.

683
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,740
 There's gonna come a day in eternity.

684
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,820
 We're gonna finally fully see, as God says,

685
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,500
 and realize who we thought we were talking to

686
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,100
 was not who we were talking to.

687
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,460
 And every person you will ever see

688
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,980
 is someone who will spend eternity somewhere

689
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,540
 and is of infinite value, whether you believe it or not,

690
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,880
 and is worthy and deserving of respect.

691
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,900
 You know how frustrated I get

692
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,020
 when people don't treat my kids well?

693
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,060
 Like my son, he's on a tee ball team right now.

694
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,260
 He plays tee ball and it's one of the first times

695
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,100
 I'm not coaching a team and I'm watching it.

696
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,500
 And I'm like, man, why are you not putting him at second?

697
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,140
 Or why are you just sitting out this inning?

698
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,060
 You need to put him out there.

699
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,620
 And I'm just kind of going through the Rolodex of like,

700
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,020
 hey, you need to put my son out there.

701
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,900
 Because I care deeply about how people treat

702
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,140
 or how my kids are doing.

703
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,620
 God has called a father

704
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,020
 of all those who put their trust in him.

705
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,860
 A father who invites anyone and everyone

706
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,180
 to come have a relationship with him.

707
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,140
 How much more does he think?

708
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,940
 When you ghosted that girl,

709
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,320
 dude, you think about who her dad is.

710
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,660
 Anybody ever dated a girl or girl whose dad was like,

711
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,420
 man, have her home by seven.

712
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,180
 That's the God who's there.

713
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,280
 And vice versa on both sides.

714
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,580
 Jesus said in Matthew chapter 25,

715
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,940
 a really interesting statement.

716
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
 He says, there's gonna come a day

717
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,100
 where at the end of the age,

718
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,500
 I'm gonna separate the sheep and the goats.

719
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,540
 He uses this analogy and it's like sheep and the goats.

720
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,140
 And the sheep will be on the right side,

721
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,100
 spend eternity with God.

722
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,300
 Then the goats, and he uses a farming illustration

723
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,100
 'cause he grew up on a farm.

724
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,820
 They're gonna spend eternity away from God.

725
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,520
 Here's how you'll know that you were among those

726
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,020
 who will spend eternity with God.

727
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,860
 And they asked, what did we do for you?

728
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,340
 And he said, I was hungry, I was thirsty, I was lonely,

729
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
 and you visited me, you cared for me.

730
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,700
 You gave me something to drink, something to eat.

731
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,880
 And it says, the people of God will go,

732
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,720
 when did we do that?

733
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,640
 And he said, whenever you did this for the least of these,

734
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
 you were doing it for me.

735
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,040
 But Jesus says,

736
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,160
 man, you don't know who you're interacting with.

737
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,280
 And every person is someone worthy,

738
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,880
 dignity, respect, being treated as such.

739
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
 And the reason that doesn't happen is we see

740
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,520
 as the world says, not as God's word calls us to.

741
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,800
 Jesus was told, or was even said by some of his enemies,

742
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,320
 and move quickly, that they said, we know,

743
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,960
 this is Jesus's enemies even said,

744
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,120
 you just are not swayed by the opinions of people.

745
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,960
 You don't think about people

746
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,920
 the way the world thinks about people.

747
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,520
 It says this, Matthew 22, verse 15.

748
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,600
 We know that you are a man of integrity, Jesus,

749
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,520
 that you teach the word of God in accordance with truth.

750
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,640
 You're not swayed by others,

751
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
 and you pay no attention to who they are.

752
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,920
 When you understand and you look at people

753
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,140
 like God says who they are, you begin to look like God,

754
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,240
 looking at their infinite value

755
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,660
 and looking at not just their external appearance

756
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,080
 or their appearance, but their heart and who they are.

757
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,280
 Matthew, or I'm sorry, 1 Samuel chapter 16,

758
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,660
 verse seven says this.

759
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,320
 People look at the outward appearance,

760
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,560
 but the Lord looks at the heart.

761
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,160
 He doesn't see the way the world sees.

762
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,200
 And as Christians, we're called to not see that way either,

763
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,800
 but to see every person is valuable

764
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,420
 and to look past the superficial, skin deep things.

765
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,000
 Finally, he gives us the cure to the sin of partiality.

766
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,880
 He says, if you really keep the royal law

767
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
 found in scripture, what's the royal law, James?

768
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

769
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,720
 You're doing right.

770
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,320
 But if you show favoritism, you sin

771
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,360
 and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.

772
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,400
 Whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles

773
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,080
 at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.

774
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,200
 For he who said, you shall not commit adultery

775
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,280
 also said you shall not murder.

776
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,920
 If you do not commit adultery, but you commit murder,

777
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,520
 you become a lawbreaker.

778
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,000
 Speak and act as those who will be judged

779
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,720
 by the law that gives freedom.

780
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,960
 Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone

781
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,200
 who has not been merciful.

782
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,160
 Mercy triumphs.

783
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,000
 Mercy triumphs over judgment.

784
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,200
 So he takes a lot and covers a lot there.

785
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
 He lays out first the royal law.

786
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,920
 He basically gives a solution and the cure

787
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,880
 to the problem of favoritism and the action

788
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
 and response that is to mark believers

789
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,200
 is that you and I are to love people.

790
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,040
 That's the cure.

791
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,080
 That's the third idea from the text.

792
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
 He says, this is what is called the royal law.

793
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,280
 Why would you call it the royal law?

794
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,080
 Jesus, who is the King of Kings, in Matthew 22 was asked,

795
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
 what's the most important commandment there is?

796
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
 And he replies, it says, love God

797
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,560
 with all of your heart, strength, mind, and soul,

798
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,360
 and love your neighbor as yourself.

799
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,000
 And then he says, all of the Old Testament

800
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,900
 can be summarized in these two things.

801
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,260
 It's the royal law 'cause it's given by the King of Kings.

802
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,720
 It's also, you could say the royal law

803
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,120
 because it's the law that rules over every other law.

804
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,140
 If you fulfill or you do that one,

805
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,280
 all the other ones are gonna follow inside of it.

806
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,120
 Romans chapter 13 says that law or love

807
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,100
 is the fulfillment of the law.

808
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,120
 All of the commands can be summed up in this one command,

809
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,960
 love your neighbor as yourself.

810
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,740
 Everything, first half of your Bible,

811
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,040
 all of it summed up in a sentence of love people

812
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,420
 and treat them the way that you would like to be treated.

813
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,160
 When it comes to how you think about them,

814
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,040
 regardless of how they look, where they work,

815
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
 where they're from, what they've done,

816
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,080
 that you would treat them and care for them

817
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,320
 and be someone who thinks about them,

818
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,720
 speaks about them, acts towards them

819
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,300
 in a way that you would want to be acted towards,

820
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,000
 spoken to, thought about.

821
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,080
 He brings up an idea that is an interesting one

822
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,640
 where he says, if you break any of these,

823
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,560
 you've broken all of them.

824
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,000
 He says, if you stumble at just one point,

825
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
 you're guilty of breaking all of it.

826
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,980
 How can you say that, James?

827
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,960
 Are you saying that murder is synonymous with favoritism?

828
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,080
 In terms of the fact that it's breaking God's law

829
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,480
 'cause God, who also said don't murder,

830
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,240
 said don't show favoritism, yes,

831
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,160
 in that sense it is.

832
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
 It's not the same and there's consequences

833
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,040
 and that in one scenario, someone dies.

834
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,840
 In another scenario, someone is disrespected.

835
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,360
 So in a immediate consequence, they're not the same.

836
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,640
 But in terms of breaking God's command,

837
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,440
 you are a lawbreaker.

838
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,800
 You have broken the law.

839
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,200
 In other words, if you were hanging off the side of a cliff

840
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,440
 and you held onto a chain that was holding you above

841
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,520
 from falling on the ground

842
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,040
 and a single link in that chain breaks,

843
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,760
 you're gonna fall.

844
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,920
 If you sin one time, he's just saying,

845
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,200
 hey, you've become a sinner, you're a lawbreaker.

846
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,040
 If you steal one time, are you a thief?

847
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,840
 If not, when do you become a thief?

848
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,680
 And that's his point.

849
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,920
 He's just saying, hey, you have fallen short.

850
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,520
 You have broken God's law.

851
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,840
 You've become a lawbreaker.

852
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:53,000
 And he equates it in a pretty serious category

853
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,620
 of adultery, murder, and favoritism,

854
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,040
 that it is a big deal to God.

855
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,240
 Christians, and the jersey that is to mark

856
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,760
 and to be on, Christians, is that of love.

857
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
 And I'm gonna explain even what I mean by that in a second,

858
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,000
 but what I mean by the jersey,

859
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,720
 Jesus said in John chapter 13,

860
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,220
 by this one thing,

861
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,800
 everyone will know that you're my follower,

862
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,640
 that you love one another.

863
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,080
 That's gonna be the thing, the world looks on

864
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,040
 and they're like, man, the way they treat each other

865
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,880
 is just different.

866
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,720
 Like, it's not normal, or we act in one way,

867
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,160
 but they act in a different way,

868
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,500
 and they're gonna be able to identify

869
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,440
 you're different from them.

870
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,080
 My son, last fall, was playing soccer,

871
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,900
 and we were doing YMCA soccer with a bunch of four-year-olds

872
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,240
 which is chaotic in and of itself,

873
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
 which is mass herds of cats back and forth

874
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,480
 waiting for Capri Sun.

875
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,960
 And at the end of our game,

876
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,440
 there was another team, or two other teams

877
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,600
 that were playing after us, and they came up,

878
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,480
 and they both had red jerseys on, like identical.

879
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,640
 Identical red jerseys.

880
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,420
 And I was sitting there watching, I was like,

881
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,520
 how, it's already mass chaos, like, run, Bobby, run, run.

882
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,360
 What is that, a flower?

883
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,640
 And then you're trying to, you know,

884
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
 get them to move different directions.

885
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 When they're all wearing the same thing,

886
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
 none of the kids can tell each other apart

887
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,040
 and know who's on my team, and it's just total chaos.

888
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,620
 Because without being able to identify and recognize,

889
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,780
 oh, they're different,

890
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,720
 they just blend in with everybody else.

891
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,000
 How many Christians, when it comes to the way

892
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,160
 that they're supposed to wear the jersey

893
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,040
 and be marked by something that makes them stand out,

894
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,440
 they look like everybody else in the world around us.

895
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,800
 The idea of, hey, be a loving person,

896
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,920
 that's not a message that is unique to Christianity.

897
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,440
 Actually being a loving person

898
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,840
 is something that is a unique thing to see,

899
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,920
 especially when it comes to being a loving person

900
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,160
 in the way the Bible describes love,

901
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,420
 which is only those who have experienced the love of God

902
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,620
 through Christ can be and live a life

903
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,100
 that flows of love towards other people,

904
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,540
 not just to love them, to get a good feeling for what I did,

905
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,460
 but actually out of a response to God's love.

906
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,020
 It's something only Christians can wear.

907
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,820
 And how many Christians claim to be followers of Christ,

908
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,460
 and yet when you look at their life,

909
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,440
 they look like everybody else.

910
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,420
 They don't give generously, they don't give differently,

911
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
 they don't spend their time differently,

912
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,260
 they don't care for their family differently,

913
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,980
 they don't use their mouth differently,

914
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,100
 they're not different at work,

915
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,500
 they blend in with everybody else.

916
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,240
 And Jesus says the jersey that is to mark followers

917
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,900
 of Christ is that they are those who love people around them.

918
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,860
 What do I mean by love?

919
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
 The Bible actually describes and defines,

920
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,000
 this is what love should look like,

921
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,180
 'cause everybody says love.

922
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,200
 Ellen DeGeneres is like, you know what we need?

923
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,500
 Love, sweet love.

924
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,260
 Everybody thinks that they have the corner

925
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,500
 on the market on love.

926
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,900
 Christians have a foundation that we love

927
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,100
 because God first loved us.

928
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,020
 Everybody else, any other worldview,

929
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,340
 or an atheistic worldview,

930
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
 you love just 'cause people tell you to.

931
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,060
 And that could change any day or any moment.

932
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,140
 Christians have a command from God himself

933
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,740
 that says you are to love people

934
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,320
 when they can do nothing for you in return,

935
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,240
 because God first loved you.

936
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,100
 That's what 1 John chapter four says.

937
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,180
 1 Corinthians chapter 13 says this,

938
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,140
 here's how you know what love.

939
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,620
 This is what you and I should be wearing

940
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,360
 and our lives should look like,

941
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,400
 and strive to look like,

942
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,860
 and the more that you and I walk with God,

943
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,560
 the more that they will look like,

944
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,120
 love is patient.

945
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,960
 Love is kind.

946
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,040
 It does not envy.

947
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,280
 It doesn't boast.

948
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,920
 It's not proud.

949
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,720
 In other words, if there's ever a moment

950
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,600
 where I'm not being patient,

951
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,540
 I'm not being kind,

952
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,080
 I'm being envious or jealous,

953
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,320
 I'm boasting about, hey, do you know,

954
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,160
 I'm kind of a big deal.

955
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,320
 I'd like to tell you some of my stuff,

956
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,120
 me, myself, and I.

957
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,360
 I'm not acting in love.

958
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,920
 It's not proud.

959
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,440
 It does not dishonor others.

960
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,220
 Anytime you dishonor someone,

961
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,240
 you're not loving.

962
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,160
 It's a pretty powerful thing to think about.

963
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
 Who'd you dishonor today?

964
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,000
 On Facebook, on Instagram, at work,

965
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,900
 behind their back?

966
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,960
 Says, you're not wearing the jersey.

967
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
 You look like everybody else.

968
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
 It's not self-seeking.

969
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
 How much does our world need to hear that?

970
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,160
 How much do I need to hear that?

971
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,360
 It's not easily angered.

972
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
 It keeps no record of wrongs.

973
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,780
 Doesn't hold things against people.

974
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,660
 Love does not delight in evil,

975
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,200
 but it rejoices with the truth.

976
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,280
 It always protects.

977
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,400
 It always trusts.

978
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,000
 It always hopes and always perseveres,

979
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,080
 and never ends.

980
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,480
 Love never fails.

981
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
 But James says, you and I are to love

982
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,160
 and be marked by the quality and characteristic of love.

983
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,240
 That's the cure for favoritism,

984
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,520
 and that is the appropriate response

985
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,320
 to every person you've ever met,

986
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,260
 whether they're attractive to you, unattractive to you,

987
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,180
 whether they look like you, they don't look like you.

988
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,440
 That is to be the quality or the characteristic

989
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,880
 that is to mark your relationship with that person.

990
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,020
 He brings up a really interesting sentence at the end

991
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,180
 where he talks about justice.

992
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,720
 Judgment and mercy.

993
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,460
 He says, if you are the type of person

994
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,260
 that passes judgment on other people,

995
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,500
 instead of being merciful to them,

996
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,740
 and you don't extend mercy to people,

997
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,240
 you will not be extended mercy.

998
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,420
 James, what are you saying?

999
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,820
 I could not be a Christian,

1000
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,900
 or I could lose my faith and relationship with God?

1001
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,500
 No, he's saying if you have been someone

1002
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,100
 who's received mercy from God,

1003
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,500
 you put your faith in Jesus on the cross,

1004
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,860
 dying in your place, rising from the dead,

1005
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,540
 that you believe I don't earn, I don't deserve

1006
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,860
 relationship with God, got it one way,

1007
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,780
 because Jesus paid for me on the cross.

1008
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,120
 He said, I will go in your place.

1009
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,660
 Everything you did is messed up.

1010
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,760
 Every sin that you've ever committed,

1011
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,100
 every pornography look that you've ever had, David,

1012
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,660
 everything that is part of a sexual past you've ever had,

1013
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,140
 every time you've gotten drunk,

1014
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,380
 every time that you've had an abortion in your past,

1015
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,980
 whatever your story is, he would say,

1016
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,460
 all of it I paid for on the cross,

1017
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,140
 and you, by saying I have received the mercy of God,

1018
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,740
 I'm putting my faith in what you did for me on the cross.

1019
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,260
 He says, when a person receives that mercy,

1020
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,180
 I don't deserve it, but it's mine.

1021
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,780
 They are someone who extends mercy.

1022
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,580
 They give people the benefit of the doubt.

1023
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,580
 They care for people, they love people, they forgive people.

1024
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,940
 How interesting, when you think about the topic

1025
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,820
 of injustice and mercy, what comes to mind?

1026
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,580
 Maybe the best picture of someone who extends mercy

1027
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,120
 in the face of horrific injustice is Jesus,

1028
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,700
 who one day, while he was out teaching,

1029
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,140
 comes and he's with his disciples,

1030
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,540
 he's arrested, he's brought in, he's beaten,

1031
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,740
 and he stands before a Roman pagan named Pontius Pilate,

1032
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,980
 and he stands there, and Pilate says,

1033
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,900
 are you the king of the Jews?

1034
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,020
 And he walks him through, and he says,

1035
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,500
 basically, I can find nothing wrong with this guy.

1036
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,940
 And he turns him back over to the people who said,

1037
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,780
 you know, Pilate, we want you to arrest him and take him in,

1038
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,620
 and he says, there's nothing wrong,

1039
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,740
 he didn't do anything wrong, even while he's here,

1040
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,540
 there's no fault I can find, I'm gonna release him.

1041
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,540
 And they say, don't release him.

1042
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,700
 And there's this big crowd that begins to gather around,

1043
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,780
 and they begin to yell, crucify him, crucify him,

1044
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,940
 crucify him, and they call for the death penalty.

1045
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,580
 A guy who's been teaching all week

1046
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,380
 with this group of people with the city of Jerusalem,

1047
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,340
 and they're calling for the death penalty at this moment,

1048
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,860
 that we thought you were gonna be different.

1049
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,100
 Crucify him, crucify him.

1050
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,940
 The perfect son of God,

1051
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,060
 having the death penalty called for in his life,

1052
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,980
 a man who had done nothing wrong, sinless his entire life,

1053
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,380
 had given sight to the blind, allowed lame people to walk,

1054
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,780
 allowed beggars to be lifted out of poverty,

1055
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,540
 brought sick people back to life,

1056
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,900
 allowed the mute to speak, healed lepers,

1057
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,140
 transformed lives, restored families together,

1058
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,180
 is being called for the death penalty?

1059
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,020
 And it gets worse.

1060
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,940
 He's taken, he's beaten, he has a place,

1061
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,180
 or a crown of thorns placed on his head.

1062
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,980
 He's led to be crucified on two wooden pieces.

1063
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,300
 And his hands are nailed into that wood,

1064
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,460
 and he's lifted up.

1065
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:33,220
 In the face of the greatest injustice ever,

1066
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,940
 what does he respond with?

1067
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,460
 Mercy.

1068
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,740
 He says in Luke chapter 24, 23,

1069
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:50,740
 hanging on a cross for sins he didn't commit,

1070
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,900
 you committed, and I committed.

1071
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,040
 He looks at those who had just nailed his hands

1072
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,000
 into that wood and says, "Father, forgive them.

1073
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,580
 "They don't know what they're doing.

1074
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,900
 "Father, give them mercy."

1075
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,540
 When Christians in the face of injustice respond with mercy,

1076
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,940
 they look like Jesus.

1077
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,100
 Let me be really clear.

1078
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,140
 There's a lot of calls for justice in our world right now.

1079
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,140
 There's a lot of angry, upset, in every direction,

1080
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,540
 with racial division, political division,

1081
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,380
 and whatever the division is,

1082
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,160
 and there's a lot of loud calls for justice as Christians.

1083
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,000
 The volume which we call for mercy should be louder

1084
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,960
 than the volume we call for justice for.

1085
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,800
 Why?

1086
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,520
 Because we know that according to Romans chapter 12,

1087
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,560
 and all throughout the Bible, there will come a day

1088
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,200
 that every sin, there will be justice for it.

1089
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
 God says in Romans chapter 12,

1090
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,900
 "Do not avenge yourself or take revenge.

1091
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,220
 "Leave it to the wrath of God.

1092
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,080
 "It is written, 'Vengeance is mine,'

1093
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,240
 "says the Lord, 'I will repay.'"

1094
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,120
 That day is coming.

1095
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,480
 Every sin ever committed, everyone caught on camera,

1096
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,840
 everyone not caught on camera, will give an account,

1097
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,280
 will pay for the sin and the actions that they've taken.

1098
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,680
 And as Christians, the volume which we cry,

1099
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,600
 even an injustice to ourself, how crazy is that,

1100
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,280
 should be louder than the volume

1101
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,480
 that we cry for justice for,

1102
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,880
 because it's what our Savior did.

1103
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,220
 And when this happens, it's astonishing.

1104
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,980
 Six years ago, almost exactly, or in a month or two,

1105
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,860
 and I'm laying on the plane, in Charleston, South Carolina,

1106
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,000
 nine people were brutally murdered

1107
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,360
 by a racist, evil person who made God

1108
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,600
 get ahold of his heart.

1109
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,260
 He walked in to a church and he killed brutally

1110
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,180
 nine different people.

1111
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,700
 He was a white guy, killed nine different people

1112
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,680
 who were black.

1113
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,700
 Horrific evil.

1114
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:59,540
 Almost immediately after, family member after family member

1115
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,660
 got up and in response at the deposition said,

1116
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,020
 I'm gonna read one of them.

1117
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,180
 From Nadine Collier, the daughter of a 70-year-old

1118
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,860
 Ethel Lance, who was killed.

1119
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,100
 "You took something from me very precious,"

1120
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,400
 speaking to the person who killed her mom.

1121
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,380
 "I'll never talk to her again.

1122
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,900
 "I will never hold her again.

1123
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,980
 "But I forgive you.

1124
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,280
 "May God have mercy on your soul."

1125
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,420
 In the face of injustice, she called for mercy

1126
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,660
 and in doing so, she looked like Jesus.

1127
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,360
 We're in a weird, crazy time where there's so much division.

1128
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,180
 But one thing that has gotta be abundantly clear

1129
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,260
 is as followers of Jesus, no matter what is taking place

1130
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,400
 around us, we don't listen to what the world says,

1131
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,240
 we listen to what God's word says.

1132
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,660
 And we call for mercy.

1133
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,300
 In the midst of the tragedy of George Floyd,

1134
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,100
 which is all taking place right now.

1135
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,020
 We pray for mercy.

1136
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,220
 That God had gotten a hold of his heart

1137
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,420
 and he's in eternity with him.

1138
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,660
 No matter what you think.

1139
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,740
 That God would get a hold of his family,

1140
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,220
 that God would get a hold of everybody.

1141
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,500
 Derek Chauvin, you know who loves George Floyd

1142
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,100
 and Derek Chauvin?

1143
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,660
 Jesus.

1144
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,380
 Whatever the worst person that you infill in the blank,

1145
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,820
 you can't believe that, that you right now

1146
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,640
 are thinking through your minds,

1147
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,580
 I can't believe that you would even say that,

1148
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,980
 and why would you call for mercy?

1149
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,580
 You know how arrogant and bigoted it sounds

1150
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,380
 for you to say, I would rather someone spend

1151
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,420
 all of eternity in hell, because I'm angry

1152
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,460
 about what someone did.

1153
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,980
 And there's a place where the heart of God,

1154
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,580
 there will be justice.

1155
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,780
 Every sin will be paid for in eternity in hell,

1156
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,220
 on the cross by Jesus Christ.

1157
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,520
 But when any of us say for anyone, towards anyone,

1158
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,220
 I hope that they go to hell forever.

1159
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,260
 You think that's the spirit of Christ?

1160
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,340
 Who says, Father, forgive them.

1161
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,580
 They crucify me, they kill me.

1162
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,100
 And this has gone too far into the church.

1163
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,720
 We have to be people who say, no matter what we face,

1164
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,220
 we're gonna love each other, we're gonna care each other,

1165
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,580
 we're gonna call for mercy.

1166
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,560
 That doesn't mean there's not a justice system.

1167
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,380
 But God, would you, in your mercy,

1168
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,420
 get a hold of their eternity and change their heart?

1169
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,940
 And because I think that my sin is not as bad

1170
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,040
 as someone else's sin, would you change any part of me

1171
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,980
 that believes that?

1172
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,940
 If you've never had a moment,

1173
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,540
 will you put your faith in Jesus?

1174
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,980
 The greatest gift is to receive that mercy yourself.

1175
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,460
 You can't give it until you've received it.

1176
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,560
 By saying, God, I believe I'm a sinner

1177
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,780
 and I'm putting my faith in what you did

1178
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,680
 for me on the cross.

1179
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,860
 You died for me, you rose again,

1180
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,180
 and I'm gonna be with you forever,

1181
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,860
 not 'cause I deserve it, 'cause you paid for it

1182
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,580
 and I accept it.

1183
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,680
 Tonight is your night.

1184
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,500
 Let me pray.

1185
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,060
 Father, I thank you that you are a God.

1186
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,300
 I thank you that you are a God

1187
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,380
 who in the face of being brutally killed,

1188
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,500
 cried for mercy.

1189
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:08,540
 The insane reality of that is beyond my ability

1190
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,740
 to even comprehend.

1191
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:19,040
 We live in a time that is desperately sick,

1192
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,300
 and the church uniquely offers the solution

1193
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,180
 of healing and unity and hope,

1194
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,380
 and I pray that you would help us to do that,

1195
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,620
 that we would be people who love one another

1196
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,880
 like we wanna be loved, like you loved us,

1197
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,380
 that we wouldn't show favorites,

1198
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,900
 that we wouldn't treat one another differently,

1199
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,620
 and you would help us to see each person we cross paths with

1200
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,940
 like you see them,

1201
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,220
 no matter who they are, how they look,

1202
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,120
 what they've done, where they're from.

1203
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,460
 I pray for anyone who's never received mercy,

1204
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,740
 a gift of mercy tonight,

1205
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,740
 that you would allow them to take that step,

1206
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,060
 have eternity, their eternity,

1207
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,360
 forever changed by putting their faith in you.

1208
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,300
 As they listen even right now

1209
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,420
 and they know that this is the moment,

1210
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,860
 would you grab hold of their heart?

1211
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,460
 For any parts of our hearts

1212
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,060
 that are not quick to extend mercy,

1213
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,280
 would you forgive us and help us, God?

1214
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,500
 We love you and we worship you now in song,

1215
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,220
 thanking you that your mercy triumphs over judgment, amen.
