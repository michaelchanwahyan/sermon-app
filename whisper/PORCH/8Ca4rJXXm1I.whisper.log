[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]   - All right, here we go.
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.600]   What's up all my friends,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.940]   all the Porchies tuning in live right now at home,
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.780]   cuddled up, quarantine.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.840]   Thanks for taking precaution
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.680]   and not coming here to Watermark tonight.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.040]   Just want to say welcome
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.920]   and welcome to the Porch Live Experience.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980]   We want you to know that just here shortly,
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.760]   I'll be interviewing Mr. David Marvin.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.080]   And so what I'd like for you to do
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.160]   is you can kind of zoom out in this moment,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.520]   hit share and tell all your friends to tune in.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.200]   We want everyone watching
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.500]   what's gonna be discussed tonight.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.060]   I think it's gonna be really helpful, really powerful.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.040]   So we'll get started here shortly.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.640]   Everyone grab your hand sanitizer,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   sanitize up and we'll see you soon.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.580]   Let's go Porch.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   - All right, what's up guys?
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.440]   Hey, this is David.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.380]   I'm joined with my friend JD Rogers.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.640]   - Hey everyone.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.820]   - If you haven't gotten to meet JD,
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.120]   he's a part of leadership here
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.880]   and we are doing what is probably gonna be the first
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.180]   of several different things
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060]   where we stream messages on Two Tonights
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.760]   for at least the next few weeks or the time being,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.460]   who knows how long that'll take place,
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.860]   but we're gonna do what we always do,
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260]   which is look at God's word
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.640]   and say, what does it look like
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.140]   in this season of young adulthood
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.940]   practically apply scripture and principles
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.500]   in the midst of any season of life
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.200]   and particularly in this season of life.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.340]   What a crazy time, dude.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.240]   - Yeah, I mean, it really is just crazy
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.380]   all that's happening just with the virus
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.280]   and the way that the world is responding to it.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.380]   And so I'm glad that we get to come to a place like this
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.160]   and talk about it to hopefully be helpful
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.660]   and just talk about all that's going on.
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.260]   And I'm just excited.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.260]   And so I know for me, David, I'm 26, single,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.600]   and I'm sitting in my apartment watching
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940]   all that's happening.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.840]   The media is giving so many mixed messages
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   and I am at home going, I don't even know where to begin.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.980]   Like, gosh, I wish I was way more media savvy,
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.280]   news savvy before this.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.460]   And I don't know which kind of voices to trust.
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.720]   I don't know.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   I mean, it's like, it seems like Trump is on there
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.980]   every day telling us things.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.400]   It seems like, I mean, for our city of Dallas,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.860]   things are changing every single day.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.560]   And I'm going, what do I do?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.940]   Like, how do I actually respond?
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.560]   Should I be more afraid than I am?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.100]   Should I be more cautious than I am?
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.540]   Like, are we even six feet right now?
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.740]   Like, and I think, you know,
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.580]   you have a lot of wisdom on this topic
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.980]   and just even getting to talk for you for just a little bit.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.520]   I think you have a lot to provide
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.460]   for the people watching right now
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.260]   and the people tuning in, which by the way,
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.760]   shout out to our friends on YouTube.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.500]   - YouTube. - Streaming with us.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.860]   We're trying to push more and more to our YouTube page.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.220]   And so glad y'all are here.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.540]   But, you know, I just want to hear from you.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.300]   Like, I'm about to take the posture of just a student
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.260]   in this moment and just let you,
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.280]   let me have it of all I should know
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940]   about how we should respond as Christians,
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.540]   as people to the coronavirus.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780]   And I'm just excited to hear from you.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.820]   So thanks for letting me just sit in this chair
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.060]   and listen to you.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.180]   - Well, Jude, I think both of us
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.940]   are gonna get a chance to hear just from God's word
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.260]   and what it says.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.440]   The principles in the midst of all the craziness
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.940]   in the world around us of anxiety
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.000]   and how to find peace have never been more relevant.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.980]   And tragically, too many Christians
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.180]   in the midst of a virus or just life,
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.460]   even before the virus, their life is marked by anxiety.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.340]   And yet God calls us and has invited us
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.660]   to a life that's marked by peace.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.620]   I'll start by sharing this.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.060]   A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go speak
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.300]   at another ministry organization that was a few hours away.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.700]   And I had a chance to take some friends with me
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.780]   on a plane that a mutual friend of ours
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.500]   had allowed us basically, which is the most random scenario.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.780]   There's not many times in my life
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.180]   that this would be the only and probably only ever time
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.540]   where somebody's like, yeah, dude, hey,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.480]   we're not using the plane.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.740]   If you wanna take it down there for ministry purposes
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.020]   and speak and then fly back,
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.780]   'cause I had back-to-back speaking engagements
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.740]   two days in a row and they'd let us.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.660]   - And it was so sketchy though.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.060]   - It was so sketchy.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.500]   Well, it's a great plane.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So if you're listening,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.660]   but a friend of ours or a friend of mine
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.100]   who used to work for me actually was the pilot.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.240]   And he was like, yeah, we'll take you down there.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.300]   We'll take you on the plane.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.140]   We'll fly you down.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.020]   I was like, dude, that's amazing.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.220]   It was a small like two prop, which is two propeller plane.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.620]   And both all this excitement was filled with,
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.380]   that's gonna be incredible, two weeks out.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.500]   And then a few days before I was like,
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.180]   oh my gosh, I know this guy.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.460]   I know the pilot.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.860]   And the pilot is somebody, it's almost like a brain surgeon.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.420]   You don't wanna be like buddy-buddy with the brain surgeon.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.960]   You don't wanna have any relationship with him.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.260]   You don't want him to be the guy that like,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.780]   oh, remember that one time that was so funny.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.620]   - Yep.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.740]   - And so anyways, as we were preparing for it,
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.820]   my community group, JD and another friend of ours
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.660]   were going down.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.140]   They joined me to fly in, speak, and then fly back.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.020]   - Didn't really know what to expect, honestly.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.860]   - Totally.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.680]   - Getting on the plane.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.300]   - The weather, we began to realize.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.140]   - Storming.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.960]   - It was stormy.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.360]   So like 24 hours before, I have a friend who's the pilot
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.860]   who I honestly don't even know if he flies planes.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.120]   This could be a whole joke.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.220]   It's stormy weather.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.060]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.260]   - And I remember telling my wife like,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.640]   hey, if we don't make it back, here's where the will is.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.580]   And here's what to do.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.340]   And you know that scene in Armageddon
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.620]   where like all the astronauts are hugging their wives,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.460]   maybe this is the last.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.380]   It felt like that.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.020]   And honestly, all my community group, ironically,
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.420]   or not ironically at all, felt that same way.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.620]   And-
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.740]   - I should call my mom.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.580]   - Yeah, I bet you did.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.420]   - I did, I called her.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.580]   - I bet you did.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.820]   Here's the biggest irony is I was flying down there
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.380]   to teach on anxiety
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.020]   and how you can experience peace from it.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.980]   And we're like on the plane and it's bumpy
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.460]   and I'm feeling every single bump.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.620]   And I just remember feeling like, man,
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.380]   a mixture of hypocrisy and irony
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   and God teaching me something
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.460]   'cause I'm flying in to teach on anxiety
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.460]   and the topic of experiencing freedom from it.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.340]   And yet what is filling me right now is anxiety.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.660]   - And it's hilarious 'cause like, y'all have to know,
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.620]   it's like a pretty small plane
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.060]   and there was how many guys?
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.900]   - Six.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.420]   - Six grown adult men on this plane.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.340]   And I'll never forget,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.940]   we're all like trying to low key act tough,
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.260]   but like at the end of the day, it starts to storm.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.140]   I remember looking at my friend and he's looking at me
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.900]   and I was like, "You scared?"
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.820]   And he was like, "Yeah, I'm scared."
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.820]   I was like, "If we grab hands, we're just praying."
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.380]   - This part I did not know, okay?
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.060]   Up in the front just praying, staring at one seaters.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.780]   - Dude, but how hilarious that you have six Christian people
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.300]   one of which is flying in to teach
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.380]   thousands of people on anxiety
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.140]   and his life is marked by anxiety.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.340]   And I start there 'cause I think a lot of us
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.740]   experience despite the fact that the Bible promises
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.780]   or calls Christians to a life
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.140]   that is guarded by peace that surpasses understanding.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.540]   Philippians chapter four says,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.540]   that God wants you to experience a life
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.460]   that is marked by a peace that surpasses understanding.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.460]   So many of us as Christians,
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.220]   we experience anxiety that surpasses understanding
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.740]   or an imperfect peace, despite the fact that God says,
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.140]   in Isaiah chapter 26,
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.220]   "If you keep your eyes fixed on me,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.260]   I keep in perfect peace, Him whose eyes are fixed on me."
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.420]   And yet that's often not the case
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.060]   of the experience of a lot of people and in our lives.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.780]   And so I think as a Christian,
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.780]   the constant question is how do I continue to apply
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.860]   rightly the principles that God has given us
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.820]   on fighting anxiety,
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.220]   whether it's in the midst of a Corona epidemic,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.500]   where I know a lot of us are,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.140]   what's at stake is not just maybe I get some symptoms
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.020]   of a cold that in my generation,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.180]   the effects are not really that big,
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.460]   but I may lose my job.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.020]   It's probably a more fearful thing.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.940]   - Yeah, I was sitting down with a friend yesterday
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.500]   and six feet apart, obviously.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.420]   And they were just expressing to me like,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.660]   "Hey, I actually don't know what to do."
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.500]   So they just moved to Dallas to start a new job
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.260]   and they get a call from their job.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.820]   And they're like, "Hey, no one can come in
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.580]   until like a month."
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.420]   And that means that they moved here
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.580]   expecting to get a paycheck to start paying their rent
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.220]   and their new apartment, which they're not cheap in Dallas.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.460]   And they're not gonna get that paycheck
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.900]   'cause they're not getting to start work.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.980]   No HR, nothing.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.340]   They haven't got to do any of the process.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.080]   And now they are literally stuck in Dallas
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   in an apartment, jobless.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.780]   And they're just expressing,
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.180]   "I couldn't have predicted this.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.300]   Like, what do I do?"
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.740]   - Yeah, and what do I do with those feelings of anxiety?
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.860]   Or like, there's thousands of people infected
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.800]   in our country.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.500]   By the time you listen to this, if it's a week late,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.620]   you're maybe 10 times that,
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.540]   which means there are hundreds of thousands of people
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.480]   who have someone they know that's being impacted.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   And so we just wanted to open up and talk a little bit
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.020]   about the subject of anxiety and what God's word says.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.760]   And it's a timeless conversation
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   or the truths from God's word are timeless,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.380]   regardless of what's going on around us.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.980]   But we know that that's a real scenario.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.800]   There's thousands of people that listen into the porch
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.140]   that are in Seattle, that are in Phoenix,
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.980]   that are at the different 15 Ports Live locations
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.400]   and in Dallas and all over.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.780]   And so we know everyone is experiencing some degree
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.080]   of being impacted by this and likely is being impacted
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.900]   by the future of uncertainty that faces all of us.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.540]   So what I wanted to do was just open up a few things
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.660]   that we know from scripture, from God's word,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.600]   and just talk a little bit about some of the stuff
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.080]   that it says.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.840]   The Bible says, it'd be a way that I'll put it.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.700]   If there was a slogan for the Bible,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.840]   it would be do not fear.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.640]   Like slogan, like what I mean by that,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.680]   like what's your favorite company slogan?
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.380]   Like slogan, I mean like Nike, just do it.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.540]   Arby's, what's the Arby's?
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.380]   It's we have the meats.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.540]   - That one's weird.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.380]   - Yeah, that one is kind of weird.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.780]   - I think mine is--
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.180]   - Or maybe it's Maybelline.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.940]   No, maybe she's born with it.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.180]   Maybe it's Maybelline.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.620]   - Every kiss begins with K.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.340]   - Every kiss begins with K, that's right.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.020]   - Mine is the, I go to like the Donut Palace down the road
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.420]   and their slogan is you deserve a donut.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.220]   It just makes me feel good about myself.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.140]   - That is one of the, no one,
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.060]   I've never heard of the Donut Palace.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.700]   - I promise you David, everyone, the donut,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.500]   this is the classic, it says donut in red letters.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   Everyone knows those places, they're all over.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.300]   Yeah, that's like the donut palace.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.820]   - So your version of that and on the bag they have--
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.780]   - Every bag has the pink sprinkle donut
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.940]   and it says you deserve a donut.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.780]   And I'm like, you know what?
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.860]   I do deserve a donut, it's Monday.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.700]   - Dude, I love it.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.100]   Whatever slogan is your favorite,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.380]   here's what, if the Bible had a slogan,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.020]   whether this would be it or it'd be in the top three
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.600]   would be do not fear.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's either like, you know, it would be the slogan
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.140]   or at least be in the top three of things.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.600]   Because, and the reason I say that
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.900]   is the most repeated command in all of scripture
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.440]   is do not fear.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   More than hey, believe, more than pray,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.780]   more than anything that you would pick up,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.320]   more than like, hey, don't have sex outside of marriage.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   The most repeated command in the Bible is do not fear.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   So God wants us to experience a life
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.900]   no matter what is going on that knows
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.660]   and is marked by peace or not by fear.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.740]   It says it 366 times, we've joked at the porch before.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.280]   That is one for every day of the year.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.480]   If you took all of them out, including leap year,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.640]   like the one that we're in right now,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.340]   like God is clearly hammering home this message.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.200]   And so first, just a high level
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.420]   that God doesn't want his people to live in fear.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.840]   So he's given principles and a path
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   towards really us experiencing that.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.360]   I think one of the things that I think is redeeming
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.140]   of Corona, at least in, you know,
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.520]   the little bit amount of time that I've had
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.360]   or that we've all had seeing it,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.720]   is it's kind of put things into perspective.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.680]   It's began to remind us that as Christians,
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.360]   biblically we're not home.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.420]   And a virus popping up reminds us that,
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.700]   oh man, this is, we live in a broken world
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.040]   that is full of sickness and death.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.240]   And sometimes because we live in America, it's so protected.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   Like viruses that pop up in most of history
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.560]   have popped up that wipe out huge amounts of the population.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.660]   We kind of like have medical staff and we're like,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   oh, you get a shot for that.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.760]   And now we're being reminded, no, life and mortality
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.260]   or your death is a real inevitable thing.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.380]   And there's some redeeming aspects that have come with it
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.940]   that can remind us I'm not home.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.060]   When I was in, I spent like five weeks in Africa
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.940]   when I was in college.
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.940]   It was like a summer, it was a long time.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.940]   It's a really long time.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.300]   - What part of Africa?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   - East Uganda.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.900]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.740]   - I love Africa.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.620]   - Dude, we were like outside of Kampala, two hours.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.480]   - Wow. - We were in the bush.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.720]   Like when people talk about out with the bush,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.360]   we were there, we were by the bush.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   It was so far off the grid.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.600]   We stayed in this village.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.440]   I mean, the experiences,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.200]   we could talk for endless amounts of time.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.040]   - That's amazing.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.960]   - I remember at some points
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.800]   when we were kind of nearing the end of it,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.520]   there would be certain niceties
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.440]   that we every once in a while got
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.280]   where you get like, oh, we get Coca-Cola.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.120]   - Cold.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.520]   - Yeah, we get a cold beverage this time.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.740]   Or we get to go experience eating at a restaurant
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.620]   or not just eating rice and beans and plantains
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.180]   out in this village or different things
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.260]   that were kind of niceties of our experience.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.100]   And there would be times
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.140]   where we were looking forward to that
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.420]   and then it wouldn't happen.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.180]   And it was like, oh man, that's a letdown.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.700]   Or times where our experience had had a change of plans
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.980]   or somebody got sick or like I got ringworm at one point,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.860]   which is not a fun experience to go through.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.980]   - You still, does that stay or?
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.060]   - No, I actually still have ringworm.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.380]   And it went through, what if it did?
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.840]   And I still have ringworm.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.960]   Just these like different, man, that's really unfortunate.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.080]   But every time, because the perspective of,
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.600]   oh, I'm going home soon.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.160]   Like this is not my permanent and new reality forever.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.000]   I'm not home.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.200]   I can face this and it put those frustrations
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.560]   or disappointments or even sicknesses all into perspective
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.660]   that, hey, I don't have access to Advil right now,
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.440]   but I will soon, I'm going home and I'm not home.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.800]   And it just was a constant reminder.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.360]   And in some ways, one of the reminders for Christians,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   I think, that Corona has put in the forefront of us
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.740]   is the reminder, you are not home.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.200]   It can be so tempting to make my life
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.420]   and try to make it so comfortable.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.560]   And one of the things that,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.720]   I don't know if it's done this for you,
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.240]   it's put in perspective, man, I'm not home.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.800]   This life, the Psalms say is a vapor.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.640]   It's like some of you guys
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.940]   are in cold environments right now, you're streaming in.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.420]   And when you go outside and you breathe,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.520]   you see the air and when you breathe and it's cold outside,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.160]   you can see your breath and then it disappears.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.800]   That's what the scriptures say our life is like.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.240]   And so to hide behind this,
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   we're gonna be here forever,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.280]   our life is gonna go on forever.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.120]   And I'm not trying to invalidate some of the pain
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.640]   and some of the tragic scenarios that people are walking in.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.560]   And who knows, man, you and I could be sick
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.800]   in any amount of time.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.400]   - Yeah, at least we're both gonna be together.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.460]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.920]   Sick as a result of this.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.840]   And with ringworm again.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.420]   But no matter what, as Christians,
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.840]   we've been told this is not our home.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.320]   Philippians chapter three, verse 20 says,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.240]   "We are citizens of heaven,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.260]   "where we anxiously await the returning of Christ
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.960]   "to make all things new, put all viruses aside.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.080]   "And God has commanded us in the midst of this,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   "do not fear, I'm in control."
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.200]   - Yeah, I think what I'm recognizing with this
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.000]   is it's causing a lot of people,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.240]   at least my age, to really think.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.000]   Like they're forced to think.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.400]   I was talking, you know, all the colleges
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   have basically shut down,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   and so a lot of college students from Virginia,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.280]   Austin, different people are back in Dallas.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.420]   And I was talking to a few of them this morning,
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.960]   and one of them was telling me that a group of her friends
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.480]   are essentially like talking about
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.320]   why is God allowing this to happen?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.540]   And they're just pondering that of like,
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.520]   why is God not stopping this crisis?
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.460]   - Yeah.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.020]   - Why is he letting this spread?
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.840]   And it was just interesting hearing the different takes
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.140]   on different people's thoughts and perspectives
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.540]   on why God was allowing this,
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.220]   or what God was doing with this,
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.020]   and trying to pinpoint, okay, what's his reason?
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.940]   What's he doing?
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.780]   - Yeah.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.620]   - And, you know, of course there was things like
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.740]   maybe he's trying to point people back to him,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.780]   maybe he's displaying his sovereignty,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.380]   how he's in control, all these different things.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.460]   And so we could talk, we could get down on that,
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.580]   but it's, I think what's just so unique
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.500]   about what is happening with this spread and the virus
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.560]   is so many people are like, wow, like it's crazy
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.280]   how much life can change.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.620]   I mean, if you think about what's happening,
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.580]   I've never in my 26 years of life
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.020]   experienced anything like this.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.700]   The closest thing was like post 9/11
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.220]   when I was like in second grade.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.060]   - Yeah.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.860]   - But I mean, the world is, it feels like it's shutting down.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.700]   - Yeah.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.900]   - And I mean, social media,
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.180]   just the different things that you're seeing
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.600]   take place around the world is just crazy.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.440]   And so you're right.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.340]   It's just bringing this whole,
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.620]   these thoughts that I've never thought about before
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.980]   about regarding life.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.820]   - Yeah.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   - And what's the point, what's the deeper meaning?
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.540]   What have I been distracting myself with?
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.380]   And so.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.220]   - Yeah.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.040]   - I'm glad we're talking about it.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   - It's broken through that mold.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.780]   There's a passage I want us to read from Matthew chapter six
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.660]   where Jesus talks about, you know, like I meant earlier,
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.460]   we're so, I don't know if it's blessed.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.820]   We are so blessed in America
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.740]   that we forget how most people in the world today live
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.860]   and how most people throughout history live,
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   where the average person I've heard it said in the 1500s
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.300]   thought about their death every single day.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.180]   The average Christian never thinks about their death.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.220]   The average young at old, at least.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.260]   They think they're immortal.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.540]   They're going to live for forever.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.260]   But when the life expectancy, not many centuries ago,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.980]   was, you know, 45, you were confronted with reality
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.660]   that I'm not going to live forever.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.500]   - Yeah.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.620]   - So to your point, it is causing people
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.340]   to be confronted with the fact
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.900]   that there's brokenness in our world.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.180]   My death or mortality is a real thing.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.700]   And what am I living for?
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.900]   Jesus spoke in a context in Matthew chapter six,
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.660]   where he spoke to an audience that did live in a time
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.940]   where, you know, there wasn't antibiotics
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.580]   and there wasn't some of the niceties that we have.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.700]   Refrigeration wasn't around, different things.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.540]   - Yeah.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.980]   - And he spoke about the topic of anxiety.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:55.980]   I just think it's so relevant.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   So I'm going to start in Matthew chapter six,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.660]   verses 24 through, let's go through 34.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:14.160]   Jesus says, starting in 25, actually,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.580]   do not worry about your life.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.620]   What you will eat or drink or about your body,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.220]   what you will wear is not life more than food
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.340]   and the body more than clothes.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.260]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.700]   They don't sow or reap as in like plant and harvest
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.660]   and get food or store away in barns
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.000]   or go raid their local target, you know, of toilet paper.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.100]   Yet your heavenly father feeds them or provides for them.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.740]   Are you not much more valuable than they?
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.000]   Can any of you by worrying at a single hour to your life?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.940]   And why do you worry about clothes?
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.100]   See the flower of the fields grow.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.740]   They do not labor or spend, but I tell you
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.660]   that not even Solomon in all of his splendor
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.180]   was dressed like one of these.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.060]   If that's how God clothes the grass of the field,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.940]   which is here today and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.780]   will he not much more clothed or provide for you?
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.780]   Oh, you of little faith.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.960]   So do not worry saying, what should we eat?
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.460]   What should we drink?
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.540]   What should we wear for the pagans
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.460]   or people who do not have a relationship
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.320]   with their heavenly father?
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.580]   They don't know they have a heavenly father.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.460]   They run after all of these things
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.860]   and your heavenly father knows that you need them.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.160]   But seek first, this is what I think is one of the most
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.020]   misunderstood and misapplied verses as it relates to anxiety.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.060]   Seek or prioritize first God's kingdom
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.900]   and his righteousness.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.220]   And all of these things will be given to you as well.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.660]   Therefore do not worry about tomorrow
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.400]   for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.240]   Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.600]   That Jesus says so many different things
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.780]   that are relevant about anxiety.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.960]   Like, hey, what benefit is worry?
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.040]   Where he says you can't add anything to your life.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.840]   Basically getting his whole audience to go.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.960]   Worry is not really helpful.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.000]   So spending time worrying about something,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.460]   he's not saying don't be thoughtful,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.120]   don't be practical or wash your hands or care about things.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.760]   He's not just like Bob Marley,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.140]   sitting on a beach with an actual Corona beer or something.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.300]   He's saying, actually be thoughtful.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.140]   But at the end of the day,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.900]   you don't have to have a life that worries
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.900]   and is marked by worry.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.180]   Because you have a heavenly father who's promised
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.860]   to provide and to care for your needs.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.020]   Ultimately on the cross through Jesus dying,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.060]   he provided in the most ultimate way.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.420]   But he's promised, man, I'm a heavenly father
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.500]   who cares about you.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.860]   And then as it relates to the seek first,
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.600]   I think it's so relevant to where we are
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.100]   because it's one of the most misunderstood principles
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.040]   on anxiety.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.120]   And the reason I say that is Jesus essentially says,
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.640]   hey, I want you to prioritize first,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   as first in your life, God's kingdom,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.560]   or God's reign, or God's agenda for your life.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.120]   Like whatever God's will for your life is,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.600]   prioritize that.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.560]   Prioritize what God wants for your life above yours.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.800]   Let there be no competition for whose will
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.160]   and whose kingdom comes first.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.660]   My kingdom, my desires, what I want,
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.580]   what I wish would happen, or what God wants to happen.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.260]   He says, prioritize those things first.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.860]   I think most people read this verse and they think,
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.780]   Jesus is just saying, hey, don't worry.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.060]   Just go on a mission trip.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.680]   Or don't worry, just have a quiet time.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.540]   And in doing so, neither of those are bad things.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.660]   Those are great things.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.580]   Things you should do.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.100]   But that misses the broader application
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.500]   of what Jesus is saying, where he's saying,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.480]   hey, I want you to embrace as first
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.100]   on the throne of your life, God's kingdom.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.480]   Focus on that, prioritize that, embrace that,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.460]   and his will for your life above your will for your life.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.000]   Even when they contradict
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.200]   is where I think it becomes really practical.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.780]   The two ways that we think about God's will,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.220]   and so help me flesh this out if this doesn't make sense.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.420]   - Can I just really fast?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.620]   When I read that verse, I think for me,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.260]   just right now personally, where I get convicted
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.040]   is I'm so prone to take part two of that verse
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.840]   and all these things will be added to you.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.380]   And I think I want all of these things to be added to me
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.960]   without seeking first the kingdom of God and what he wants.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.000]   Because I think I know that when I seek God
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.400]   and what he wants, the things that I want to be added to me
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.000]   will probably change.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   So right now what I want to be added to me is,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.760]   will you get rid of this thing?
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.540]   So that way I can get back to my normal life.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.160]   But what if I sought the kingdom of God first?
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.740]   And what actually changed in me was like,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.740]   hey, if this means that a world will come back to you,
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.660]   then so be it.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.580]   - Totally.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.620]   - And that's scary.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.780]   Like that's a scary thing to ask essentially for suffering.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.620]   - Yes.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.060]   - To ask for person, like to ask to go through a trial,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.300]   because that's just not how I'm prone to think.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.980]   I'm prone to go, I want my things to be added to me.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.920]   And so what that can create is like this like
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.460]   cause and effect with God where it's like,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.840]   okay, I'll go do my quiet time.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.000]   I'll seek first.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.320]   And then you'll answer my prayers.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.920]   Like these things will be added to me.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.760]   - Yes.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   - And it's just like, if you're truly seeking God's kingdom,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.320]   that means that you are actually setting aside your agenda,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.840]   like you said.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.980]   And then it's kind of, your agenda is not existing anymore.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.600]   And I don't want to do that.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.440]   Like, I don't know.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.560]   - Yeah, I mean, if you're like, hey, I'll do these things
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.980]   so that I will get God to give me what I want.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.820]   - Yeah.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.640]   - God's not your God.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.480]   The things that you want are your God.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.780]   - Yeah, you're not actually doing those things.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.980]   - Yeah, or you are your own God.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.500]   - Yeah, you're playing a mind game on yourself.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.580]   - Yeah, and so I think as it relates to prioritizing
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.440]   God's will for my life, what does that look like?
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.900]   The two ways that we know the will of God for your life
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.420]   is what's revealed in scripture.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.260]   It's actually like theological people,
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.660]   or if you go to like school and seminary
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.260]   or Bible college to study this stuff,
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.640]   they'll talk about how there's two wills of God.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.280]   There's the unrevealed will,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.380]   which is kind of like how he allows sovereignly,
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.860]   which is just a word like he's in control,
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.860]   but he allows things to happen
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.100]   that are a part of our broken world,
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.320]   but he's still controlling things.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.820]   I mean, he's still working things for good.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.980]   And then there's the revealed will, which is the Bible.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.740]   Like everything in here, we can know,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.540]   hey, what does God want for certain arenas of life?
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.980]   We know it and we can read it.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.740]   And so as it relates to prioritizing first,
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.540]   I think it looks like, hey, I'm gonna prioritize.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.740]   I wanna live according to what God calls me to live by
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.780]   as there is revealed will is here.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.940]   So I'm gonna do what he calls me to.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.740]   And then his unrevealed will,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.740]   I prioritize that by embracing as it unfolds in my life,
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.500]   like as things go and my day unfolds before me,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.820]   and it's not going how I wish it would have gone,
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.940]   or even my life is not going the way
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.780]   I wish it would have gone.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.460]   I wish I would have been married by this age.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.980]   I wish I would have not moved to Dallas and lost my job.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.180]   I wish there wasn't a coronavirus
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.660]   that was putting everything on hold.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.700]   As that goes, I'm gonna choose to embrace,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.220]   God, if that is your will, I trust you in the midst of it.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.500]   I trust you're bringing things together for good.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.340]   You've promised that in Romans chapter eight.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.700]   I trust that you have a plan that you are bringing
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.020]   according to your wisdom to pass.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.840]   He's using this clearly for good.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.100]   Even where an outbreak took place in China,
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.540]   the church has been strengthened
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.660]   and people are seeing the way
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.340]   that Christians over there are responding.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.420]   And it's just showcasing, man, Jesus is better,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.180]   that he's using even the worst things he's bringing about.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.260]   So I think as a Christian, I am confronted with,
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.400]   'cause candidly, what I get anxious over
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.780]   is not God's kingdom, it's over mine.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.240]   I mean, I don't know about you, you probably never do,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.700]   but when I get anxious, it's like the things
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.080]   I don't want to happen may happen,
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.100]   not like God's will happening.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.380]   So whenever I'm confronted with things not going
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.500]   as I wish that they would, I can either be anxious
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.940]   or I can trust, man, God, as it's your sovereign will
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.780]   is unfolding in front of me, I trust you, I trust you.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.300]   And my worries about I'm not ultimately
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.940]   gonna get what I want are kind of crazy
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.060]   because the truth of the matter, as we've talked before,
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   is like, you're not gonna get everything that you want.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.620]   Life and everything that you want it to go as,
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.620]   or however you want your life to go,
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.900]   it's not gonna always go the way
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.900]   that you wished it would, right?
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.260]   So you're not gonna get everything you want
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.360]   always, so you can have not everything you want in life
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.500]   and peace or not everything that you want
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.140]   in life and anxiety, but not everything you want
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.500]   or having everything you want in life,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.140]   that's not an option, but peace is for the believer.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   And what I think is so hard, my son is into like superheroes
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.100]   right now and like Avengers.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.460]   - Favorite one.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.120]   - He like changes every day.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.660]   So he wore a Black Panther for Halloween.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.420]   He's wearing, candidly, he's wearing Black Panther
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.780]   right now, Wakanda.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.860]   - My favorite movie.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:55.700]   - And I'm not kidding.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.660]   If you follow me on Instagram, you'll see like,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.580]   that is every day.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.820]   He's fighting the coronavirus with the mask of Black Panther.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.140]   He's four, by the way.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.980]   So anyways--
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.140]   - Black Panther's not getting the coronavirus.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.820]   - No, oh dude, definitely not.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.900]   - Honestly, he might be onto something.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.220]   - He's got that purple thing that makes him so.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.540]   Anyway, so he's like all about it.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.820]   And his favorite one changes like every day.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.380]   And so he has a new superpower like every day
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.860]   of like, man, I'll fly or I can do this.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.100]   It's just like this made up superpower
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.380]   that he'll act like he has 'cause it's what you do
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.720]   when you're four.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.640]   - Or 26.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.480]   - Or 26.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.900]   This stuff that JD was actually wearing
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.460]   his Black Panther costume right before we started here.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.580]   We thought about wearing it, but no.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.820]   It's a made up superpower.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.920]   He doesn't actually have that thing.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.680]   And when I think, I hear people talk about,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.220]   times like this are hard 'cause I just struggle
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.100]   with control.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.860]   Even our language around that is a funny way of putting it
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.660]   because it's like my four year old son saying,
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.820]   dad, I just struggle with super Hulk strength.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.600]   And it's like, no, you don't son.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.240]   That's not a good excuse for why you pushed
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.420]   over your sister.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.940]   Because you have super Hulk strength, which is,
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.780]   that happens.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.700]   - I see where you're going with this.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.100]   - In the same way, somebody is like, man,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.100]   I just struggle with control.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.540]   You're like the four year old saying,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.160]   no, I just have super Hulk strength that I struggle with.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.080]   No, you don't.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.060]   You struggle with, that's nuts.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.140]   You struggle with not having control.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.980]   You're delusional.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.100]   You don't have control.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.360]   You've never struggled with control.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.980]   You struggle with not having control.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.660]   And God has invited us to a life where we surrender.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.740]   We say, God, I trust you.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.580]   I can bring all my anxieties to you
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.420]   'cause you care for me.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.680]   You're a father in heaven who loves me.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.420]   And when things don't go as I wish that they would,
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.840]   I can pray and ask those things to change.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.260]   But I've been invited to trust you
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.460]   'cause I know you're good and you love me
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.380]   and you're at work around me.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.780]   So I'm gonna embrace your kingdom
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.540]   and your agenda for my life first.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.380]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.620]   - Yeah, that's so relevant to this
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   because it's moments like this where you have no control.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:56.500]   It just shows how much we can do nothing.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.260]   We're literally just waiting around
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.940]   for Trump or whoever to tell us what to do next.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.700]   And it just does something to us
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.020]   because we're so used to thinking we have control.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.800]   I mean, something else that people are,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.940]   this is kind of bringing up people talking
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.380]   about just all that's happened in 2020.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.500]   Like I think about when Kobe died
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   and Kobe, you know?
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.260]   And I think that's what people were most shocked by.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.300]   It was like, he was this figure of like strength
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.420]   of like, I mean, he was just a rock.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.460]   - It's still crazy.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.280]   - Exactly.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.020]   And then you see, boom.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.980]   - Yeah.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.340]   - It just gone.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.300]   Life is a vapor.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.140]   - Yeah.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.420]   - And it's like, wait, no, not Kobe.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.260]   - Yeah.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.080]   - That can happen to random over here,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.340]   but not Kobe and his daughter.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.740]   Like what, what, how?
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.540]   And it's just, I mean, not even Kobe had control
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.460]   of his life and he had everything.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.300]   - Yeah.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.940]   - And so this, I mean, God is just doing something
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.760]   - Totally.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.660]   - In 2020 where he's showing, I mean the whole world,
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.380]   but I mean really American people,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.620]   what I'm seeing is like,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.100]   I think there are parts of the world right now
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.000]   that are like, our lives are, I mean,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.620]   this isn't the biggest deal to them,
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.980]   like it is to America.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.640]   - Oh yeah.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.860]   - And we are like, what do we do?
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.380]   I mean, we're freaking out.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.220]   - Yeah.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.040]   - Because we just don't know how to respond
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.060]   to these kinds of things.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.340]   It's really revealing, like you're saying.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.460]   - Totally, man.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.220]   So the final thing I think is so relevant for Christians
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   as it relates to anxiety.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.060]   So if you're going, hey, if you put them into buckets,
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.300]   it's that one, knowing God has called us,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.500]   we don't have to live a life of fear.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.060]   He's commanded us and invited us to pursue a life
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.460]   that perfects that peace,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.060]   increasingly more perfect peace,
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.800]   no matter how imperfect the peace we experience now is.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.000]   He's invited us to trust him, that he's at work.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.800]   If you're a Christian, you can trust him.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.120]   That'd be the second idea,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.400]   that he's at work in the midst of your circumstances
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   and you don't have to worry.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.960]   Worrying is not helpful, it's not productive.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.640]   And as things unfold in front of you
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.360]   that are not how you want them to go,
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.880]   God is saying, trust me.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.120]   I love you so much, I gave my son for you.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.680]   You can trust me.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.800]   And ultimately, you can see that provision
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.680]   of a heavenly father through what he did through Jesus.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.020]   And then the final most practical thing
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.180]   that I think is the most overlooked is prayer.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.620]   That the number of people who,
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.140]   a number of times probably in my own life,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.760]   that I felt anxiety and it didn't move me quickly
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.060]   towards prayer, but just towards further anxiousness
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.720]   and dwelling on whatever I'm worried about,
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.340]   rather than going, man, now I'm gonna take this moment
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.180]   and pray.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.580]   And I don't know what it is.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.580]   It's like that fog you get in when you get anxious
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.860]   where you can't even like snap out.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.900]   You need somebody else to be like,
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.860]   hey, have you prayed about this?
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.740]   Like, have you prayed yet?
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.160]   And you're like, oh yeah.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.000]   That's exactly what I should.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.180]   Philippians chapter four,
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.660]   I think we've got this verse in there.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.000]   Philippians chapter four verses four through six
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.020]   or six and seven.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.160]   It talks about, do not be anxious about anything,
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.460]   but in every situation and everything that you face,
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:02.620]   by prayer and petition with thanksgiving,
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.320]   present your requests to God and the peace of God,
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.380]   which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.100]   and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.880]   What is so nuts to me about this verse?
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.020]   It says the same thing three times.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.140]   Like people will try to distinguish
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.060]   and we may agree to disagree here.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.460]   If you go back and look at the Greek,
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.000]   the differences between prayer,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.040]   which is bringing your request to God,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.220]   petition, which is bringing your request to God,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.820]   like asking if you petition something,
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.480]   you're asking for something,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.660]   and then presenting your request to God,
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.880]   they all mean the same thing.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.860]   They're so close.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.940]   In other words, sometimes I've heard people be like,
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.940]   no, this is this type of prayer
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.780]   and this is this type of prayer.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.980]   It's not really a great case for that.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.100]   The usage is in the original,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.020]   let's not even go into it.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.660]   Point being, Paul's point is just,
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.060]   hey, go to God, bring your request to God.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.900]   You should bring those things,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.380]   whatever you're anxious about.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.940]   First Peter chapter five says,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.300]   cast all of your anxieties or everything you care about
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.540]   on God because he cares for you.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.120]   Bring all of those things.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.140]   So I think as Christians,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.980]   we're reminded that we're to be in constant communication
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.020]   to bring every moment of anxiety that we have
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.060]   and bring those to our heavenly father.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.740]   And we recently on my team,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.060]   I'll illustrate it like this on our staff team here,
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.660]   we switched to something called Microsoft Teams,
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.100]   which I know you've been using
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.740]   or have been forced to use recently.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.560]   - I have.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.220]   - Microsoft Teams is like, for people who don't know,
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.180]   it's like a, if Evernote and FaceTime.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.460]   - Zoom.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.340]   - Yeah, and Zoom had a baby.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.840]   - Yeah.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.180]   - And maybe like another one.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.440]   - It's like a Slack.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.360]   - Yes, yes, that's exactly like Slack
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.860]   or like any work communication.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.980]   It's like all those together.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.260]   And we switched over it,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.980]   like I think sometime last year, nobody ever used it.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.100]   Like I'd never used it ever.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.920]   - I did.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.220]   - Production team may have, but our team.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.060]   - We used it strong.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.140]   - Never did.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.740]   - And we're ready now.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.940]   - And you were ready until our team never used it
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.460]   until this week.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.460]   And because it allows you to like FaceTime and communicate.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.540]   - Now you're all waking up.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.220]   - Now we're all waking up.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.020]   And so we are all over that thing
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.740]   'cause people are working remotely.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.700]   And the reason that's relevant is it's like,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.820]   hey, we never use that communication
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.340]   until a catastrophic event hit.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.180]   And now we're all over that form of communication.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.460]   - I'm just seeing, I mean,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.100]   everyone's posted about it on Instagram.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.120]   Like I just keep seeing all these leaders and stuff
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.500]   post their teams with all their faces,
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.820]   you know, on the conference calls.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:33.660]   Dude, totally.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.480]   - It's hilarious.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.900]   - My guess is most of them never used that until this week.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.740]   Until this catastrophic event.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.620]   - And you don't even know, like they've asked us,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.260]   like, it's like a thing that's like,
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.860]   hey, we need to use this.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.700]   - Do this, yeah.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.380]   - We got this to use it.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.780]   And we're like, yeah.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.060]   - Yeah, it's a point.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.180]   - And it's hilarious.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.020]   I know where you're going with this.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:55.820]   Obviously, like God has asked us to pray.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.860]   - Constant communication.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.700]   - Constantly.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.220]   - And most Christians, it takes a,
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.260]   just like in Microsoft Teams,
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.380]   nobody used it till a catastrophic event
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.500]   or catastrophe happened.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.780]   - I hope I better come to God now.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.020]   - That's when most Christians pray.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.260]   And God has said, no, this is not the bat phone
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.060]   where it's like, man, every time there's an emergency,
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.580]   go to that one red phone and call it.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.900]   It should be a constant walkie talkie
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.260]   or constant texting with God, if you will,
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.820]   through prayer of what I'm feeling, what I'm experiencing.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.440]   So I want to give three questions really quick,
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.220]   and then four things that should mark Christians.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.060]   Three questions, if you're experiencing anxiety,
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.100]   and I think we're probably close to wrapping up,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.460]   is man, what am I anxious about really?
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.260]   In that fog of anxiety,
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.320]   I just want you to ask the question,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.020]   what are you really anxious about?
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.180]   Like your friend, let's use her or him
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.060]   or whoever moved here, their job.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.900]   - Her.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.620]   - Her, I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.900]   to make rent that I just signed a lease,
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.060]   and I'm worried that I won't be able to make rent, okay?
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.100]   - Yeah, here's what I want to first say to her,
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.660]   is like, that is so valid.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.500]   - Totally valid.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.580]   - That's what like, I want people to hear like,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.520]   your concern is valid.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.360]   - You should, you should be thoughtful, but let's--
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.940]   - And as a Christian.
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.540]   - Yes, if there's an irrational level of like panic,
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.580]   I'm freaking out, I'm worried,
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.700]   I think then you gotta go--
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.540]   - You gotta chill.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.460]   - What's behind, like further behind that?
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.340]   Well, I'm worried I have to move back home with my parents.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.780]   Okay, what happens if you move back home with your parents?
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.380]   I feel like I'm gonna be a failure,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.860]   or that I'm not going, this is not what I wanted to happen.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.620]   Okay, you're ultimately worried about
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.260]   you not getting what you want to happen,
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.340]   and that's okay, it's an understandable thing,
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.820]   but as Christians, we've been invited to say,
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.000]   God, as things don't go how I want them to, I trust you.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.500]   So I just want to ask the question of like,
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.160]   what are you really worried about?
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.580]   Like, what is behind the worry?
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.640]   Most people just stop and they say,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.100]   I'm worried about not making rent.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.700]   Okay, well, what happens if you don't make rent?
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.340]   I'd have to move back home.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.300]   What happens if you have to move back home?
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.300]   Well, I'm--
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.020]   - My mom's divorced and can't stand--
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.020]   - To be so toxic.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.860]   - Yeah.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.420]   - Okay, hey, you're worried that God may want you to be
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.740]   on mission to your mom for a season,
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.020]   and let's just be honest, you just don't wanna do that.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.220]   You're worried about not getting what you want.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.420]   So I just wanna encourage everyone to evaluate,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.020]   really, what am I worried about?
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.260]   And then the second question behind that
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.500]   is what would scripture say to inform my worry?
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.740]   Whether it's, well, I don't wanna live with my mom.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.060]   Philippians chapter two says,
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.060]   do nothing out of selfish ambition,
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.620]   like selfish desire, like what you want,
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.180]   do nothing in that way.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.760]   So maybe the most loving thing is that God moves you back in
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.480]   because he wants you to be on mission to your mom
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.300]   who doesn't know Jesus and has that.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.780]   So what is the lie behind there?
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.840]   And then I would, no matter where you are,
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.740]   as you're trying to navigate, what am I feeling?
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.660]   What am I really anxious about?
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.700]   And then what's the lie?
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.340]   What's the scriptural truth?
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.020]   What would God say about this?
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.780]   Like whatever's behind actually my worry.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.060]   And then I would continue to pray
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.660]   and just bring those things to God, confess those things.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.260]   God, I'm anxious, I'm gonna have to move back in
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.380]   with my mom, and I don't even wanna admit that,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.020]   but I don't want to do that right now.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.980]   Just say those, bring those honest prayers to God
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.020]   in the midst of this time.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.140]   - I think that verse you referenced,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.540]   I think a lot of people are familiar with that verse.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.880]   Do not be anxious about anything but,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.500]   and everything, prayer, supplication, all that.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.460]   The ending of that verse, it says,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.900]   "The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding."
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.740]   - Yeah.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.000]   - Again, control.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.100]   There's something about, like even in peace,
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.500]   we want to understand, like we want to know,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.780]   how do I get it?
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.240]   How do I obtain it?
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.060]   And how do I know when I have it?
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.900]   - Yeah.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.760]   - And there's just something about like,
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.860]   it's this peace that surpasses all understanding.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:51.860]   So it's like, people are, I think they don't trust prayer
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   because they don't really trust that they're gonna,
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.900]   it's like, how can I get peace from this?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.660]   - There's no way.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.500]   - Yeah.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.060]   - If there's no way I can get peace from this situation,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.300]   you don't know it, dude.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.520]   You don't know what I'm going through.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.620]   You don't know how much I have to pay,
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.820]   or how much debt I'm in, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.900]   And it's like, there's no way I'm getting peace from this.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.740]   - Yeah.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.560]   - They don't trust it.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.420]   And I would just say to that,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.200]   I've had to like take that step of,
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.760]   I don't understand it.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.540]   - You know why I think Paul says that?
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.440]   This is kind of my opinion, but I think it's in the text.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.720]   I think he implies that as you know God,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.540]   and especially the more you know him,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.540]   the more you bring those things,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.180]   you're like, I don't wanna move in with my mom,
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.500]   but I know that you're good, you love me, you're for me.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.060]   You got this, you're in control.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   Like you're a great dad.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.980]   Like the more you know God, the more you go,
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.220]   here's what I wanna do,
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.140]   but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.300]   I trust you, you're awesome.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.140]   - Right.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.960]   - And I think the more you know God,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.460]   the more you're like, God is awesome, he's for me,
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.660]   he's good, I can trust him.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.260]   And people whose faith like amazes me,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.380]   like, man, I got cancer and I'm praying God
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.220]   will take it away.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.540]   But if he doesn't, that's okay,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.440]   are people who know God deeply and intimately.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.980]   So that's where I think the idea of imperfect peace,
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.380]   there's a perfecting to peace
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.060]   that comes through knowing God more.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.900]   The more that you know him,
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.640]   the more that you experience increasing levels
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.380]   of that ever increasing peace or ever perfecting peace.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.900]   And--
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.060]   - It's so, like I always say with prayer,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.900]   for people that haven't actually practiced it,
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.500]   the way that we're called to,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.900]   I always say like people who don't pray
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.860]   are people who have never prayed.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.180]   And like, I know that sounds duh,
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.180]   but what I mean is like,
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:42.180]   once you have biblically and like how you're called to pray
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.200]   and communicate with God,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.260]   it creates such change in your life
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.620]   that you're like, I don't ever want this to stop.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.820]   And so I would just encourage people,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.300]   like we need to be,
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   like we need to pray now more than ever before.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.380]   And like you said, pray,
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.660]   don't just pray like, Lord, take away the coronavirus.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.500]   Like, I think a lot of people right now need to pray
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.100]   about those things that they're actually worried about
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.780]   and to spend time actually talking to God
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.840]   and not just like, you know, but communicating with Him.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.680]   So that's good.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.340]   - I, here I'll close this,
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.740]   close here and give you guys four things
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.520]   that I think God wants to mark us right now.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.380]   In my front and backyard,
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.980]   I'm like trying to get grass to grow.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.660]   It's a pretty frustrating thing.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.420]   And that for whatever reason,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.660]   God has sovereignly given me a yard that will not,
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.820]   that every year I like put down sod
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.700]   and then it dies or it gets patchy
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.500]   and it's like, good grief, this is so annoying.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.620]   - Your neighbors have good grass?
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.220]   - Oh, they have great grass.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.540]   Dude, they have the best grass.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.740]   I'll take a picture and send it to you
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.900]   'cause it's like, oh my gosh, this is unbelievable.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.820]   And I'm embarrassed and I look like the neighbor
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.980]   who's not trying and it's like, people,
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.020]   I am trying, I'm giving it 100 out here.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.820]   - Hey, Marty, and he's like, hey, Dave.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.260]   - Oh, dude, he's fertilizing, it looks incredible.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.100]   Anyway, so, but one of the problems is like,
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.060]   I'll get weeds will come in
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.100]   and I don't like to pick weeds
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.620]   'cause you gotta go down, you can't just weed eat.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.780]   You gotta like get the roots, you gotta pull them out
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.980]   because those will choke out the grass.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.140]   And the reason I share all that is because
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.180]   what's interesting is like weeds and grass,
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.220]   and this is profound, require the same thing to grow,
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.260]   soil and water and sunlight.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   Like those are the same things.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.740]   I know this is not a botany class.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.300]   - Facts. - Facts.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.820]   They require the same thing to grow.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.980]   And without those, they're not gonna grow.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.380]   And what's interesting is faith and fear
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.060]   require the same thing to grow.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.900]   The soil of uncertainty.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.460]   And the same way that grass and weeds
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.460]   both grow in the same dirt or the same soil.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.820]   So fear and faith both grow in the same soil,
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.660]   which is uncertainty.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.620]   And in this time, yeah, you should write that down.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.740]   - Can you tweet that?
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.820]   - In this time, God, I think,
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.620]   wants to grow the faith of Christians.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.820]   As we face uncertainty,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.660]   He wants us to begin to prune
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.980]   just like I'm pulling out the weeds so the grass can grow.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.300]   Anytime those fears pop up, I'm taking those,
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.100]   I'm confessing them, I'm addressing them with God's word.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.740]   I'm doing everything I can to bring others in
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.980]   and just say, man, I'm afraid of this right now.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.300]   I don't think it's what God wants for me,
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.380]   the scripture says.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.940]   I don't wanna confess those things
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.860]   'cause He wants us now.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.700]   And I think there's such a huge chance
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.740]   for people in society to go,
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.780]   there's something different about Christians.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.500]   They're marked in uncertainty.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.060]   What's growing in their life is faith.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.500]   What's growing in my life is fear.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.340]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.900]   - And so how do I make sure that I'm disciplined
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.540]   to proactively, I wanna prune my life
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.340]   through confessing when I got a weed of fear there
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.060]   and addressing it with God's word.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:46.300]   - That's what pumps me up the most about this
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.140]   is I think we've talked about this.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.820]   I think this is a time like never before
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   where the gospel and Christianity is just screaming.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.140]   It's just proclaim to the world.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.980]   - Totally, man.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   - And that is such a good, I'm gonna use that.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.820]   - You mind if I?
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.300]   - Dude, you'd steal it away.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.180]   Nothing to it.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.340]   Hey, last four things.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.180]   Do you know what time we're at?
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.500]   I don't know how much time we have.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.700]   - I think we're in like.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.540]   - 40?
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.380]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.200]   - Okay, here's the last things.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.140]   I think it's worth flying through these really quick.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:15.980]   - Okay, totally.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   What are they doing?
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.980]   - Yeah, they're hanging at home.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.820]   - Netflix?
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.860]   - Knitting a sweater?
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.300]   - Turn off the Netflix.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.140]   Good grief for that.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.100]   - It is time.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.020]   - You can knit while you watch.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.260]   Here's four characteristics.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.100]   I think scripturally that we shared earlier
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.660]   on Instagram live that I think are what God would have
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.420]   at least these things, Marcus.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.140]   And as I pray through, like God, increase these in my life,
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.080]   that we should be in their four Ps.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.480]   In this season, we should be prayerful as Christians.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.220]   We should be marked by productivity
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.940]   and that we're not just, hey, every day, what do I do?
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.300]   I'm home, I can't go to work, I just Netflix binge.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.900]   We should be marked by productivity,
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   by proclaiming the gospel with people that are around us.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.540]   Hey, you can go back.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.900]   Go back to the one before that.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.860]   Productivity, go back to the one before that.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.820]   Go to the fourth one.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.060]   Oh yeah, and practical.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.100]   That scripture says, hey, we should be practical.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.940]   So what do I mean?
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.940]   So very quickly, like prayerful.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.300]   Colossians 4, verse two says,
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.180]   hey, be watchful, be devoted to prayer.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.860]   That you and I should be praying for Trump,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.740]   for the administration, for leaders.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.700]   Romans 13 says, all those in high places.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.100]   Or 1 Peter 2 says, pray for all those who are in high places.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.300]   Prayer should mark your life.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.860]   You should be praying for those who are sick.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.000]   Pray for vaccine.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.820]   Pray for a chance for the church to be strengthened
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.700]   wherever you live in.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.820]   You should be practical.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.740]   As in like, it's not heroic or extra Christian
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.500]   to be like, I'm not washing my hands ever.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.980]   No, that's just selfish.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.940]   One of my favorite verses-
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:39.780]   - I trust God.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.540]   - In James 4, we were laughing about this before,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.100]   where James 4 says, hey, wash your hands, you sinners.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.340]   And which I know someone's like,
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.740]   that's not what they're talking about.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.180]   I know, it's just a funny verse at least.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's a funny context.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.820]   So hey, be practical, be thoughtful.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.940]   Don't be selfish.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.420]   And be considerate of things to not spread
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   the continuation of the virus around you.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.300]   Be productive.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.120]   Ephesians chapter five says, make the best use of time.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.960]   So be productive.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.260]   That's the third P, if you will.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   Like, how do I grow in my relationship with God
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.580]   in this unique season where I'm slowing down?
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.300]   How do I connect with God?
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.980]   And then proclaim.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.500]   How can I use this through my interactions with my neighbors,
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.280]   through my interactions on social media?
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.260]   How can I showcase the gospel to people?
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.140]   And then I care for people and the needs of people.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.020]   Maybe there's elderly folks around you
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.440]   and you go out of your way to not bring virus to them,
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.820]   but say, can I care for you?
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.660]   Is there anything that you need in the midst of this time
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.980]   to prevent them from having to go out in public?
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.020]   And also I wanna proclaim faith over fear
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.260]   that God is in control.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.920]   I have a heavenly father and I know that,
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.460]   and I believe that.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.780]   So man, I think that would be all that I have.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.940]   - Dude, that's good stuff.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.780]   - Come on, dude.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.260]   - I know I'm encouraged.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.540]   I'm walking away.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.900]   Like, seriously, I'm not just saying this
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.720]   'cause you're my boss.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.300]   Like, I'm walking away. - And he has to.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.340]   - Way more empowered.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.180]   Thank you.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.480]   And just way more like,
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.740]   I feel like I just have more purpose in this pandemic.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.160]   And I think I have a lot more now
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.840]   just to be equipped in to help people.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.440]   'Cause I do think that this isn't over soon.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.400]   - No, I think you're right.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   - And so I think grabbing onto resources like this
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.220]   are really helpful.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.800]   So thanks for just taking time.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.160]   I know you have a family.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.440]   I know you have things that you have a lot going on.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.080]   You're trying to run a ministry now, all digital.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.780]   And so thanks for taking the time to sit down with us
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.820]   and those tuning in live right now
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.500]   and just sharing like your wisdom.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.720]   It's like super helpful.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.660]   - I would not miss it.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.660]   We love Porch Nation and love my own family
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.180]   and love the Porch family get to be a part of.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.020]   So let me pray.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.420]   Hey, if you are on YouTube watching this,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.340]   we'd love to hear from you.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.180]   What are you going through?
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.380]   How can we be praying for you?

[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.840]   And like you said on YouTube earlier,
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.920]   if you're hitting this,
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.060]   make sure to hit subscribe so that you're notified

[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.300]   - We're gonna try to like funnel more
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.100]   onto our YouTube channel.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.360]   And so that's why we want you to subscribe.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.860]   It's not like, girl, we're following.

[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.100]   'cause more than ever before,

[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.380]   So that's kind of the intent behind that.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.220]   - I love it.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.040]   Hey, let me pray.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.620]   God, thank you for just a chance through communication,
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.420]   through digital communication and through technology
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.260]   and just all the different people
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.900]   that are a part of helping put this on,
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.000]   you're allowing us to still communicate your word
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.800]   all over different cities and states and people's homes.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.540]   And so I pray that whatever we shared today
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.020]   was in line with your word would be remembered and applied.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.900]   And would you deeper apply those
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.540]   and help JD and myself to more deeply apply
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.780]   just those principles to experience increasing peace
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.060]   in our own life from the God who's invited us
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:50.880]   to experience it.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.840]   So we pray that you would stop the virus.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.860]   You would provide a vaccine and a cure,
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.460]   but we pray that you would help your church to be strong
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.380]   and full of faith, not fear in this time.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.000]   And so help us to be marked by that and to live that out.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.840]   We love you.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.660]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:07.700]   Would you come quickly?
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.560]   And if you don't, would you make much of yourself
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.420]   in the midst of this?
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.260]   We love you.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.080]   Amen.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.920]   - Amen.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.760]   - All right.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.580]   We'll see you next week.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.940]   - Hey, well, elbows.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.820]   - Elbows.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.800]   - You guys stay safe out there.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.980]   - This is like worth like $1,000.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.820]   - Yeah.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.260]   - Like that's incredible.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.100]   All right.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.920]   Hey, we'll see you next week.
