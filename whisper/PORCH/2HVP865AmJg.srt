1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,000
 - Woo, let's go.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,360
 Come on, welcome to the porch.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,760
 My name is Josiah and man, it is a privilege to serve here.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,160
 Thanks, mom.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,320
 Man, we are excited that you're here.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Man, if you're watching online with us tonight,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,040
 if you're in one of our Porch Live locations,

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,360
 Porch Live Indianapolis, my friends there,

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 Porch Live Boise, Idaho, Tulsa, Oklahoma,

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,140
 Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas, and a slew of many more,

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,980
 man, welcome.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,560
 And of course, my friends here in the room, welcome.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,400
 Man, we're glad you're here.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,880
 We are in a series titled, "There He Said It,

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,140
 Shocking Statements from Jesus."

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,440
 We started last week with David Marvin,

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,080
 and we are looking at these shocking statements from Jesus.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,440
 Last week, we talked about this statement that Jesus said,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,120
 "Love your enemies," which is contrary, man.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,400
 It's contrary and it's revolutionary to the world.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,840
 And so if you weren't here last week,

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,880
 I encourage you to hop on Spotify, iTunes, check it out.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,600
 It's an incredible message.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,080
 But tonight, we pull up to a statement that Jesus said,

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,800
 and it's this, "You must be born again."

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,760
 You must be born again.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,960
 And man, when I first heard that, I was like,

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,600
 "What, that doesn't make sense.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,960
 That's kind of some cultish statement.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,240
 Like what, that's weird.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,480
 What do you want me to do, go back in my mama's womb?"

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,560
 Right?

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
 And maybe that's where you're at tonight.

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
 You hear that statement and you're like,

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,620
 "Man, that's confusing."

37
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,240
 And so I would just say, you're not alone.

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 We're gonna pull up to a passage of scripture

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
 in John chapter three.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,400
 If you have your Bibles, you can open those up.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,040
 Middle of the Bible, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
 John chapter three, we're gonna be in verse one.

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
 And we're gonna watch, we're gonna read

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
 about an interaction that Jesus had

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
 with a man named Nicodemus,

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,520
 who thought the very same thing.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,320
 And so I believe that God in his sovereignty

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,720
 has something really powerful to convey to us tonight.

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,440
 Like he conveyed it over 2000 years ago

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
 to a man named Nicodemus.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,320
 But tonight, 2000 years later, on July 27th, 2021,

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,280
 right here at the porch, God has preserved this book

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 that we call the Bible, so that we would open it up

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
 and we would read it and hopefully walk out of here

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,960
 with a better glimpse of Jesus,

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,720
 so that we can respond rightly and appropriately

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,960
 as we open up the word of God.

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,360
 We're gonna be in John chapter three, starting in verse one.

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
 Let me set this up this way.

60
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,600
 Jesus is, man, showed up on the scene.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,520
 He's doing incredible miracles.

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,920
 Like he just turned water into wine at a wedding,

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,880
 which is amazing.

64
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 Would've loved to be at that wedding.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
 [laughing]

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,840
 Come on, don't lie.

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
 Some of you are like, "Can you say that?

68
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
 "You're in church."

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,280
 Yes, I can say that.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,160
 But listen, he did these incredible things.

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,400
 Like he let the lame walk, the blind were seen.

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,080
 I mean, he was doing some incredible miracles

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
 that no one had ever seen before.

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
 His teaching like no other.

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,320
 Giving people a different paradigm of belief,

76
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,520
 a different way of living.

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,400
 Love your enemies.

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
 What, Jesus, you must be born again.

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,520
 And he's saying these radical statements.

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,180
 And you got three categories of people.

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,060
 You got the all-inners, like those are his boys, man.

82
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,880
 Those are people that wanna follow him

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,960
 and go wherever Jesus tells them that they're gonna go.

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,120
 And then you got kind of the wait-and-seers.

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 These categories are kind of categories of people

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,900
 that we would maybe categorize in our life.

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,740
 The wait-and-seers, it's like,

88
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,560
 "Hey, if Jesus succeeds, man, I'm all-in.

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,720
 "But I'm gonna kind of hang out here on the fringes,

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,980
 "and I'm just gonna kind of watch.

91
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,720
 "And man, if he does what I want him to do,

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,780
 "man, then I'll be all-in.

93
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,760
 "Or if he's successful, then I'm gonna follow him."

94
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,160
 We call those people bandwagon friends, right?

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,280
 Like, "Hey, oh, you made it.

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
 "You got influence, right?"

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,240
 And so that was the wait-and-seers.

98
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
 And then you have another category of people.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,360
 Those are the naysayers.

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,080
 These were people that were trying to kill Jesus.

101
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,560
 Those are the people that always have something bad

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,140
 to say about you.

103
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,600
 Those are the people that are the haters.

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,680
 And so you have these three categories of people,

105
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,920
 and Nicodemus would probably be in the wait-and-seers.

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,600
 Like, he had some questions,

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,480
 and really, some honest questions.

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
 And he was examining the evidence of Christ.

109
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,760
 Maybe you're here tonight, and you're like,

110
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,260
 "Man, what's this Jesus thing about?

111
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,860
 "I'm here to kind of examine and see

112
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,660
 "if Jesus is really who he says he is,

113
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,800
 "or man, can he really do much in my life?"

114
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
 That was Nicodemus.

115
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,700
 We'll pick it up in verse one.

116
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,300
 "Now there was a man of the Pharisees

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,780
 "named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."

118
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,100
 Verse two, "This man came to Jesus by night

119
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,760
 "and said to him, 'Rabbi,'" which just means teacher,

120
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,820
 "we know that you are a teacher come from God,

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,220
 "for no one can do these signs that you do

122
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,600
 "unless God is with them."

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,240
 Verse three, "Jesus answered him, and he said this,

124
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
 "Truly, truly, I say to you,

125
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,440
 "unless one is born again,

126
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
 "he cannot see the kingdom of God."

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,880
 And can you imagine what that would have felt like

128
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 in that moment?

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,160
 What are you talking about, Jesus?

130
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,960
 Like, born again?

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
 Look at Nicodemus' response.

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,900
 "How can a man be born when he is old?

133
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,140
 "Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb

134
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,980
 "and be born?"

135
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,520
 Like, he's clueless at this response

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 that Jesus has given him.

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,980
 And I think it's an honest and really appropriate response.

138
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,100
 He's like, "What, what, do you want me to go back

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,820
 "in my mother's womb by newsflash, Jesus?

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,040
 "Like, she died years ago," scholars would say.

141
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,760
 And so Jesus drives this point home

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,780
 in the next three verses, verse five.

143
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,080
 "Truly, truly, I say to you,

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
 "unless one is born of water and spirit,

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,120
 "he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

146
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,240
 So water means born physically,

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,500
 and spirit means born spiritually.

148
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,400
 Verse six, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh,

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
 "and that which is born of the spirit is spirit."

150
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,160
 Verse seven, "Do not marvel that I say to you,

151
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,340
 "you must be born again."

152
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,720
 You must be born again.

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,880
 This is the shocking statement from Jesus tonight

154
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,440
 that we're gonna unpack.

155
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,300
 And you know, when I was prepping for this message,

156
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,960
 I couldn't help but think about

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,880
 the newest member of my family.

158
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,160
 I think he's gonna be up on the screen here.

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,880
 This is Josiah Caleb Jones.

160
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,920
 Like, he's straight mean mugging the camera, y'all.

161
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,420
 Too soon, too soon, go back to that first picture.

162
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,360
 Look at the little mean mugging.

163
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
 And so he came into the world,

164
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,400
 literally six months ago, not six days,

165
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,640
 that'd be a big dude.

166
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,880
 (laughing)

167
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,120
 No, six months ago to tomorrow's date,

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,280
 he came into the world.

169
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,040
 And I don't know if, you probably have not experienced this,

170
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,720
 the pregnancy and then the delivery,

171
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,240
 90% of the room probably haven't experienced this.

172
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,740
 Maybe you have, maybe you haven't.

173
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,360
 But it's crazy, y'all.

174
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,520
 Like, it is stressful, it's a thrill, it's a rush.

175
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,180
 Because you have like this shot clock

176
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,400
 of like nine months hanging over your head.

177
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,080
 And you just wonder, like, is the baby gonna be early?

178
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,840
 Is the baby gonna be on time?

179
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,600
 Or is the baby gonna be late?

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,860
 And for us, man, our baby was late, like Caleb was late.

181
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,680
 And so when the due date got there,

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,200
 we were like, oh, no baby.

183
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 Like, is something wrong?

184
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,220
 And you start kind of freaking out,

185
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,440
 you start asking all the questions that you should ask.

186
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
 It's like, no, nothing's wrong.

187
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
 But then the doctors are like,

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
 they give you like a three to five day window.

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
 And they're like, hey, if your baby doesn't come

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,640
 in these three or five days,

191
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,700
 like we're gonna have to induce, not you, but your wife.

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,080
 We're gonna have to induce your wife.

193
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,220
 And induce just means like,

194
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
 hey, we're gonna speed up the delivery process.

195
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,320
 Because hey, ain't no woman trying to have a 10 pound baby.

196
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,400
 Amen, right ladies?

197
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,200
 I mean, my wife sure ain't trying to have a 10 pound baby.

198
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,400
 And so, you know, I'm kind of the guy,

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,740
 this is a real conversation.

200
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,680
 I was the guy that's like, hey, hey, babe,

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,240
 like, let's just trust God.

202
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,060
 Like, you know, he's rarely early, you know,

203
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,080
 never late and always on time, amen.

204
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,040
 And so that's a real conversation.

205
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,800
 Like, that's a real conversation I was having

206
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
 with my wife, Kathy.

207
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,280
 And she's like, ah, I don't know.

208
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,720
 Doctors seem like they know better.

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
 And I'm like, okay, well,

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,600
 I kind of think we should trust God.

211
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,480
 And let me just say, this is free.

212
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,700
 Hey, fellas, when your wife is having a baby,

213
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,920
 what she says goes.

214
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,480
 And so we get induced.

215
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
 All right, so I grabbed the bag, we get in the car,

216
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,820
 make sure the car seat is in the car, all buckled up.

217
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,840
 Like, man, we're ready.

218
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,720
 We step foot into the hospital, check in, we get our room.

219
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,060
 And then I go in coach mode.

220
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,200
 Man, before I came into ministry, I was a coach,

221
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
 coach baseball, love it.

222
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,920
 We can talk about that later.

223
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,840
 But I go in coach mode and I got my checklist out.

224
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,520
 I'm like, babe, you got the perfect bed,

225
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,720
 got the pillows, right?

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,320
 You need some ice, like not the big cubes,

227
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,560
 but the kind of the Sonic crushed ice, right?

228
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,360
 And yeah, some of you like, uh-huh.

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,520
 And then I get her some water.

230
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,960
 And then I got the tunes, man, just a little bit of tunes,

231
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,760
 a little Marvin Gaye, no, not Marvin Gaye, that'd be weird.

232
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,880
 (audience laughing)

233
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,840
 No, maybe some Shane and Shane, right?

234
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,660
 Playing in the background, just low, just low.

235
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,640
 And then the doc walks in, the doctor walks in, right?

236
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
 And I'm like, hey doc, hey, listen, listen.

237
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,720
 Hey, I wanna catch my son.

238
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
 She said, not a chance.

239
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,860
 I said, come on, doc, I got hands.

240
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,160
 I played baseball most of my life.

241
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,520
 I've been known to catch a thing or two.

242
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
 And she said, all right, get this man some latex gloves.

243
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,680
 True story.

244
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,320
 And so about that time I'm putting these latex gloves on,

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,520
 we go to push and I'm not even playing.

246
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,280
 Like five pushes and the baby is out.

247
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,640
 Like Caleb is out, he's in my arms and he's crying, y'all.

248
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,800
 I cut the umbilical cord.

249
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
 See, I think we gotta move here.

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,920
 I think we're gonna show it right here.

251
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,000
 No, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing.

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
 I'm playing, my wife would kill me.

253
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
 My wife would kill me.

254
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,480
 Hey, some of y'all were like, is he really gonna do?

255
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,120
 No, no, no.

256
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,520
 Y'all crazy, man.

257
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,400
 Gosh.

258
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,260
 So I cut the umbilical cord, give him to my wife.

259
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,040
 And then I'm like, man, that was a thrill of a lifetime,

260
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
 y'all.

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,440
 Like it was stressful, but it was a rush.

262
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
 And it was a moment I'll never forget.

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
 But you know what another moment I'll never forget?

264
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,840
 I took Caleb back into my arms

265
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
 and I laid him right on my chest.

266
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
 I think we've got a picture of that too.

267
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,640
 Come on, come on.

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,280
 And here's what I learned.

269
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,880
 Here's what I felt like what God was teaching me.

270
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
 Hey, this baby came into the world.

271
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,120
 And Caleb, man, he had nothing to do

272
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,320
 with deciding to be born.

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,080
 Like no decision-making, he was entirely dependent

274
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,240
 on his parents to be born.

275
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
 And when I was holding him for the first time,

276
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
 I recognized how needy this little guy was.

277
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,160
 And nothing, like he couldn't do anything.

278
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,640
 Like he was totally dependent on his mommy and his daddy.

279
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,320
 And so I start there tonight.

280
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,840
 I share that story with you tonight

281
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,720
 because in the same way, we're totally dependent

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,200
 on our parents to come into the world.

283
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,480
 We are totally dependent on God

284
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,320
 to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

285
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,600
 Like, did you catch that?

286
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,080
 Like we are totally dependent on God

287
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,320
 to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,080
 Like he's the one that allows us to go into heaven.

289
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,280
 And Jesus is having a conversation

290
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,640
 with a man named Nicodemus about the kingdom of heaven.

291
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,920
 And Jesus tells him, unless one is born again,

292
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,040
 he cannot see the kingdom of heaven.

293
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,080
 So tonight, I wanna answer the million dollar question.

294
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,040
 What does it mean for someone to be born again?

295
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,180
 Because here's what's at stake.

296
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,680
 Like if we don't understand this,

297
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,040
 like if we don't understand this incredibly

298
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,160
 shocking statement from Jesus, you must be born again,

299
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,440
 he's gonna say later on in the chapter

300
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
 that you're gonna spend eternity,

301
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,880
 I'm gonna spend eternity separated from him

302
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,020
 forever and ever in a place called hell.

303
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,720
 And so we have this man named Nicodemus who goes

304
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,720
 and the scripture says he goes by Jesus at night.

305
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,120
 And that's shocking in and of itself.

306
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,680
 Like maybe he was like scared to be associated with Jesus.

307
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,080
 Maybe he kind of had one foot in the world

308
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
 and one foot in this like Jesus thing, right?

309
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,600
 And he's going to Jesus by night.

310
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,440
 Maybe he was trying to uphold a reputation

311
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,000
 or maybe he was trying to win the approval

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,920
 of this group of people

313
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,400
 and he couldn't be seen with Jesus.

314
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,560
 But he had enough faith to step out

315
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,800
 and have a conversation with Jesus and to pursue Jesus.

316
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,480
 Like some of you come into this room

317
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
 and you have enough faith to show up here

318
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,080
 on a Tuesday night.

319
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,760
 Like you have enough faith to darken the doors

320
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,200
 of Watermark Church and come to the porch

321
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,920
 and man, I would just say praise God.

322
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
 Like maybe you heard we got good vibes, right?

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,280
 We got good music and we talk about real stuff

324
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,960
 and our messages and you're like,

325
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,280
 and you heard we got girls here.

326
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
 Like some of you are like, ooh, yeah.

327
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,260
 Sorry, I digress.

328
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,560
 But some of you tonight, you know,

329
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,900
 emphatically deep down inside, you're not all in with Jesus.

330
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,000
 Like you're going through the motions of your faith.

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,160
 And this is where Nicodemus finds himself.

332
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,160
 Like he marvels at Jesus.

333
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,080
 He's like, man, this Jesus, like he's not a religious leader.

334
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,280
 Like he didn't go to seminary.

335
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,480
 Like he didn't get that sophisticated degree,

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
 the lawyer degree.

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
 Like he's not any of that.

338
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,360
 Like he's a carpenter from Galilee, y'all.

339
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,840
 But he's doing some amazing things

340
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,880
 that no man has ever seen, no eye has ever seen,

341
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
 no ear has ever heard.

342
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 And he can't deny the power of God in this man named Jesus.

343
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,960
 And so I wanna answer this question.

344
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,960
 What must we do to enter the kingdom of heaven?

345
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,680
 Like Jesus said, we must be born again.

346
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,320
 And so to answer this question,

347
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,880
 I wanna walk us through a picture

348
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
 that will illustrate the answer to the question.

349
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,000
 I've drawn this illustration on a piece of paper.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,360
 I've drawn it on a napkin before.

351
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,000
 I've drawn it on a dry erase board.

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,040
 I mean, I've put it on my hand before

353
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,200
 as I've been talking to young adults in the city

354
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
 at coffee shops or restaurants, waiters or waitresses

355
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,880
 or whatever the case may be.

356
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,960
 And I'm finding myself in a conversation

357
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,560
 and things turn spiritual.

358
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,040
 And so tonight I wanna answer this question.

359
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,400
 How can someone be born again through an illustration

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,660
 that will be on the back of this middle screen?

361
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,060
 And so here we go.

362
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,620
 Let's start with man.

363
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,300
 More specifically, when I say man, I mean like humanity.

364
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,900
 I'm like, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to myself.

365
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,880
 And so what do we know about man?

366
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,780
 What do we know about humanity?

367
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,940
 Like what we know about man is that man is created.

368
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,340
 Like Genesis 1:27 says,

369
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,900
 so God created human beings in his own image

370
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,980
 and the image of God, he created them.

371
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,140
 Male and female, he created them.

372
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,140
 And so what we know about man is man is created by God.

373
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,120
 We also know that man is sinful.

374
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,460
 This is another characteristic of man.

375
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,540
 Like I've been in hundreds of conversations

376
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,960
 and no one has ever said, yeah, I'm perfect.

377
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,360
 Like something deep down inside of us knows

378
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,800
 that something's broken, something's just off.

379
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,620
 And Romans 3:23 says, for everyone has sinned

380
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,500
 or for all have sinned and fallen short

381
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,020
 of the glory of God.

382
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,420
 Like this glory of God is like his standard

383
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,520
 and his standard is perfection.

384
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,580
 So man is created, man is sinful,

385
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,280
 but here's what also man is, loved.

386
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,940
 Love, John 3:16, you might be football game here in the fall

387
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,100
 and you might see in the end zone, John 3:16,

388
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,380
 hold up on a sign or Tim Tebow,

389
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,940
 the comeback player of the year, I'm calling it y'all.

390
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,940
 Gonna have that John 3:16 on the eye black, right?

391
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,660
 For God so loved the world that he gave his one only son

392
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,240
 that whosoever believes in him shall not perish

393
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,100
 but have everlasting life.

394
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,140
 What do we know about humanity?

395
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,500
 We know that man is created, he's sinful,

396
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,040
 but he's loved by God.

397
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,040
 And then God, what do we know about God?

398
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,140
 Genesis 1:1 says, in the beginning,

399
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,440
 God created the heavens and the earth.

400
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,220
 We realize and we know from that one verse,

401
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,500
 the very first verse of the Bible that God is a creator.

402
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,060
 We also know that God isn't just a creator,

403
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,220
 but he's holy y'all.

404
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,180
 First Peter 1:16 says, for the scripture say,

405
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,940
 you must be holy because I am holy.

406
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,620
 This word holy means to be set apart,

407
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,980
 it means to be perfect, it means to be without sin

408
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,340
 and thought, word or action.

409
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,180
 Categories I fall short in every day.

410
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,820
 We also know that God is not just a creator or holy,

411
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,460
 but he's, God is love.

412
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,920
 First John 4:8 says, anyone who does not love

413
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,260
 does not know God for God is love.

414
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,780
 And so look at what you have here on the screen.

415
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,380
 You got man on one side, he's created,

416
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,620
 he's sinful, but he's loved.

417
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,820
 And then on the other side, you got God.

418
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,820
 He's the creator, he's holy, but he's love.

419
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,940
 And so the characteristic that distinguishes the two,

420
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,660
 man and God is, man's a sinner and God's not.

421
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,260
 And so you have a chasm, you have a separation

422
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,660
 because God is holy, he's perfect, and man's not.

423
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,640
 And what man tries to do, humanity tries to do,

424
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,660
 is man tries to build these bridges to get to God.

425
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,740
 This is my story, the bridge of good works.

426
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,180
 I'm gonna do some good works to try to build that bridge

427
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,660
 to God, I'm gonna help the homeless,

428
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,900
 I'm gonna be kind to everyone,

429
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,200
 I'm gonna think as long as I'm a good moral person,

430
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,620
 then that's gonna bridge the chasm of separation to God.

431
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,420
 So we try to be good enough in our own goodness

432
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,580
 to get to God, but then we realize that, hey,

433
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,260
 God's standard is perfection, and so we can't get there,

434
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,060
 so that bridge falls short.

435
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,340
 And so we're like, man, good works, no,

436
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,460
 I know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna be religious.

437
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,660
 I'm gonna be really religious,

438
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,180
 like I'm gonna come to the porch every Tuesday,

439
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,380
 I might even go on Sundays.

440
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,900
 Like I'm gonna get a Bible, I'm gonna read it,

441
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,580
 I'm gonna wear that cross necklace,

442
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,860
 I'm gonna get the tattoo of the cross,

443
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,980
 like I might even get baptized, yeah, baptism,

444
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,580
 that's what's gonna bridge the chasm of separation to God.

445
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,260
 Or I'm gonna pray in this direction

446
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,620
 for this amount of times a day,

447
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,660
 or I'm gonna read this book, I'm gonna walk this path.

448
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,660
 And we think in our religious activity,

449
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,420
 that's gonna bridge the chasm of separation

450
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,940
 between God and man.

451
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:20,380
 And what we find out is that bridge falls short too.

452
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,380
 And so we have this chasm of separation

453
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,760
 that we just can't seem to bridge.

454
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 Any Olympic fans in the room tonight, Olympics, come on.

455
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,280
 Man, Olympics are going on, you can turn on the TV anytime,

456
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,520
 any day, and you can watch an event.

457
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,600
 Like I love me some Olympics.

458
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,560
 And man, I love swimming, man, that's just a,

459
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,900
 that's an incredible sport.

460
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,280
 Michael Phelps, the goat, man, I miss,

461
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,480
 oh yeah, we got some Michael Phelps fans in the room.

462
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,980
 Like he is the goat, man, I miss watching him swim.

463
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,460
 And so let's just say you and I,

464
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,020
 we're gonna have a swimming competition, okay?

465
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 So we're gonna line up, you're there, I'm there,

466
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,660
 and like Michael Phelps is there.

467
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,100
 And you're like, man, there's no way, like no way, Josiah.

468
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,780
 Like he's gonna win every time.

469
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,520
 But here's the deal, here's the deal.

470
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,620
 We're gonna compete, and we're gonna start in New York,

471
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,300
 and you're gonna go to London, okay?

472
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,660
 Stay with me, stay with me.

473
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,100
 And you're like, man, that's impossible.

474
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,860
 That's like thousands of miles.

475
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,860
 Like even Michael Phelps and all of his athletic prowess,

476
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,180
 like wouldn't be able to swim that distance.

477
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,200
 Like he is going to, he might make it a lot further

478
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,460
 than you and I will, but he's not gonna make it.

479
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,820
 It's too great of a distance.

480
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,580
 I think everyone would be like, yeah, that makes sense.

481
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,800
 But listen, listen, don't miss this.

482
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,260
 Our good works.

483
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,300
 Our religious activity

484
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:03,860
 is too great a distance for us to bridge the chasm

485
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,420
 of separation between us and God.

486
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,840
 Like did you catch that?

487
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,920
 Like those bridges will fall short.

488
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,480
 Like the distance between us and God is too great, y'all.

489
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,240
 Like some of you right now, like you're fighting that.

490
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,020
 Like you're fighting, like no, Josiah, like I'm a good person.

491
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,200
 22 years of my life, I thought the same thing.

492
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,160
 You know why?

493
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,320
 'Cause I compared my life to everyone else.

494
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,860
 Even people in the church.

495
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,240
 And when you compare your life to everyone else,

496
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,100
 even people in the church,

497
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,700
 you can always find someone worse than you,

498
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,220
 which gives you security in the fact

499
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,100
 that you're not that bad.

500
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,260
 And when I stopped comparing my life

501
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,500
 to people in the church even,

502
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 and started comparing my life to Jesus,

503
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,920
 my mouth was stopped of all justifications.

504
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:07,100
 And so if you try on your own merits,

505
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,060
 your own good works, your own religion,

506
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,180
 scripture says that those will fall short

507
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,020
 in a place called hell.

508
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,620
 And listen, I get it, like hell is not popular,

509
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,100
 but look at what 2 Thessalonians 1:9 says.

510
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,220
 It says, "They will be punished with eternal destruction

511
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,780
 forever separated from the Lord

512
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,260
 and from his glorious power."

513
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,740
 And I get it, like it's not popular to talk about hell.

514
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,880
 But Jesus talked about hell twice as much

515
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,400
 as he talked about heaven.

516
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,700
 Because let me ask you, if God allowed sin into heaven,

517
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
 what would heaven look like?

518
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,060
 It would look a lot like this world.

519
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,940
 And when sin entered into heaven, or excuse me,

520
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,980
 when sin entered into this world,

521
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,660
 heaven's a perfect place, come on,

522
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,960
 someone say amen on that.

523
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,940
 When sin entered into creation,

524
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,940
 it sent creation into chaos, Genesis 3.

525
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,740
 And so we see tsunamis, we see earthquakes,

526
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,780
 we see natural disasters, we see coronaviruses,

527
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,820
 we see death, we see cancer, we see rape,

528
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,620
 we see murder, we see all kinds of destruction.

529
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,560
 And it's because sin entered the world.

530
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,180
 And it sent this entire creation into chaos.

531
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,060
 And so God must assess a penalty for sin.

532
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
 He can't allow it into heaven.

533
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,940
 And so like, sometimes when I think about hell,

534
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,860
 I'm like, oh, that's just for like the Adolf Hitlers

535
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,900
 of the world.

536
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,140
 Like that's for the really, really bad people.

537
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,460
 Because every time I think that way, I think,

538
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,740
 or every time I think that way,

539
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,840
 I start going down that road that I went down for 22 years,

540
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,000
 I start comparing my life to everyone else.

541
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,200
 And some of you, man,

542
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
 if you just had to be honest tonight, that's you.

543
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,400
 Like you find ways to justify,

544
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,440
 it's like, man, I'm not that bad, come on.

545
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,320
 Like, we just, I just go out every once in a while,

546
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,600
 like once a week, you know what I'm saying?

547
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,900
 Like, that ain't that bad.

548
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,520
 Or I just, you know, I mean, we just kind of get,

549
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
 you know, we kind of get freaky.

550
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,440
 It's just like once a month, nervous laughter.

551
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,720
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
 Some of you are like, man, I just hit that,

553
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,440
 I just hit that every once in a while.

554
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
 Like, it's not that big of a deal Josiah,

555
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,400
 but you know, it alters your thinking

556
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 and now you're not sober and you're not under

557
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,360
 the guidance of the Holy Spirit, of God.

558
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,800
 That's what controls you, not him.

559
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,220
 That's what satisfies you or you think, not him.

560
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,640
 And so let me ask you,

561
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
 are you aware of what God has done for you?

562
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,840
 Like man didn't get to God by doing enough good things.

563
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
 God came to man and he started the process.

564
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,560
 God entered into the human race

565
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,120
 through the person of Jesus Christ.

566
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,000
 And the Bible says that Jesus died for your sins.

567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
 Look at what Romans 5, 8 says,

568
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,560
 but God showed his great love for us

569
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,400
 by sending Christ to die for us

570
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
 while we were still sinners.

571
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,320
 I love that.

572
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,600
 I circle that, I underline it,

573
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 while we were still sinners.

574
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,440
 You know why?

575
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,800
 Because God didn't wait for you and I

576
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,900
 to clean our life up.

577
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,040
 If you wait to clean your life up before you come to him,

578
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,300
 you'll never come to him.

579
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,520
 He said while we were yet sinners,

580
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,540
 he knew everything that you and I would do

581
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,720
 way before we were ever even born.

582
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,480
 And he said, I'm gonna die for that.

583
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,960
 I'm gonna die for him, I'm gonna die for her.

584
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,760
 And I'm not gonna wait until you clean your life up.

585
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,560
 (congregation laughing)

586
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,880
 Let me ask you something.

587
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,000
 Have your hands ever been to places

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,960
 that you wish they'd never gone?

589
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,560
 That's me.

590
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,520
 Now I've taken my hands to places of violence.

591
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,440
 I've stolen things.

592
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,000
 Man, I'm not proud, say this in all humility,

593
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,600
 but taking advantage of women with my hands

594
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,380
 in ways that I never wish I ever did,

595
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,480
 just to fulfill my lustful desires.

596
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,900
 Let me tell you something.

597
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
 The Bible says that Jesus had nails

598
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,320
 that were pierced in his hands

599
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
 for every time your hands and my hands

600
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,360
 had been to places that they should never have gone.

601
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,960
 How about your feet, man?

602
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,520
 Your feet, have your feet ever gone to places

603
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,720
 that you wish they'd never have gone?

604
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,760
 You know that bar that you said,

605
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,820
 hey, I'm never gonna go back there.

606
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,160
 You wanted the freedom to drink,

607
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,040
 but now you have the freedom to drink.

608
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,240
 You don't have the freedom to stop drinking.

609
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,840
 And you told yourself, hey, I'm never gonna go back there,

610
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,040
 but now you're a slave to the bottle.

611
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,400
 Let me tell you something.

612
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,560
 Jesus had a nail that was pierced in his feet

613
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,800
 for every time your feet and my feet

614
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,680
 have gone to places that they should never have gone.

615
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,000
 How about your eyes, your thoughts?

616
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,360
 You ever looked at things?

617
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,380
 You ever thought of things

618
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,440
 that you wish you never looked at or thought of?

619
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,560
 I was exposed to pornography at a young age.

620
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,900
 Led me to be a porn addict for a decade of my life.

621
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,920
 Almost ruined my marriage before I ever got married.

622
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,440
 I had so much anger built up inside of me

623
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,720
 because my parents divorced

624
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,620
 when I was going into the sixth grade.

625
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,820
 Jesus said, hey, I wore a crown of thorns

626
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,780
 for every time you looked at things and thought of things,

627
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,360
 even you thinking of the anger

628
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,880
 that you and I come into this place with

629
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,820
 because of the wrong that's been done to us.

630
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,020
 He said, I wore a crown of thorns for that.

631
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,420
 How about your back, man?

632
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,760
 You ever turned your back on God?

633
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,500
 Oh, I have, plenty of times.

634
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,620
 Every time I chose my sin instead of him.

635
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,240
 Jesus said that there was these Roman centurion soldiers

636
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
 right before they put Jesus on the cross

637
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,880
 and at the end of the whips

638
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,520
 were sharp metal objects, glass and nails,

639
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,200
 and they whipped Jesus.

640
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,800
 And as they whipped him,

641
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,200
 that sharp metal objects and glass and nails

642
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
 sunk into his flesh for every time you and I

643
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
 have turned our back on God.

644
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,840
 How about your heart?

645
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,180
 Your heart ever harden itself to God?

646
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,440
 I was driving down the road one day

647
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,060
 and my roommate from college,

648
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,280
 also a teammate that I played baseball with,

649
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,520
 got a call from a buddy of ours.

650
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,360
 Said James passed away in a tragic plane accident.

651
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,720
 He's dead.

652
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,140
 You know what I did in that moment?

653
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,180
 I cursed God.

654
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,940
 I said, God, how could you do that?

655
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,540
 Like what's wrong with you?

656
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,280
 And in the still small voice that God sometimes speak to us

657
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,720
 as we bow our chest up at him,

658
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,400
 he said, Josiah, my son,

659
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,600
 that wasn't me that did that.

660
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,120
 That was the sin curse world you live in.

661
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,920
 Things aren't perfect, even airplanes.

662
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
 And on this side of eternity,

663
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
 there will always be tragedy.

664
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,520
 There will always be suffering.

665
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,720
 There will always be heartache and pain,

666
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,840
 but take heart.

667
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,660
 I've overcome the world through the person of Jesus Christ.

668
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,480
 See, here's where I'm getting at, friends.

669
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,860
 Jesus can free your hands, your feet, your eyes,

670
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,580
 your thoughts, your back and your heart

671
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,740
 because justice was paid at the cross.

672
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,540
 See, we all scream justice when we've been wrong.

673
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,180
 Like when I've been wronged,

674
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,020
 and I had a guy live with me one time,

675
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,340
 took him in, he was homeless,

676
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,100
 and he stole a check from me, $500.

677
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,180
 He just ripped it out of my checkbook,

678
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,900
 wrote it to himself, cashed it,

679
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,760
 and in that moment, I was like, justice!

680
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,380
 I want justice!

681
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,920
 But what about when we wrong God?

682
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,100
 God says, justice.

683
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,100
 But my son paid for every sin that you've ever committed.

684
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,620
 All of your sin was poured out on him at the cross,

685
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,540
 and he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath,

686
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,700
 the wrath that should have been poured out on you and me.

687
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
 It's called the great exchange, y'all.

688
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,860
 Jesus got what we deserve, and we get what he deserved.

689
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,720
 Like it's the most beautiful picture of reconciliation

690
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,060
 and love that anyone could ever have

691
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,580
 on this side of eternity,

692
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,780
 and so scripture says that he didn't just die for our sins.

693
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,300
 History records that Jesus rose again on the third day,

694
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,840
 and when he did that, he defeated sin and death,

695
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,060
 and the problem is that man, humanity, woman,

696
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,540
 is still at a distance from God,

697
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,300
 but God has built the bridge.

698
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,720
 Now the ball is in your court and my court.

699
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
 The bridge is called the cross,

700
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,540
 and what, I would just say,

701
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,700
 what are we gonna do with Jesus?

702
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,180
 Like what are we gonna do with Jesus?

703
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,820
 Like God has made the way.

704
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,660
 In Romans 10, nine and 10, it says,

705
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,060
 if you confess with your mouth,

706
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,420
 don't go on autopilot because you've heard this before,

707
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,700
 it says if you confess with your mouth

708
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
 and believe in your heart

709
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,540
 that God was raised from the dead, you will be saved.

710
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,020
 For with the heart one believes and is justified,

711
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,620
 and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.

712
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,980
 If you confess with your mouth

713
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,940
 that Jesus is the leader of your life,

714
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,980
 that everything he did for you

715
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,660
 is enough to forgive you of your sins,

716
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,820
 and believe in your heart

717
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,060
 that God raised him from the dead, you'll be saved.

718
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,060
 And so I love this verse because it says simply,

719
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,420
 confession plus belief equals salvation

720
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,080
 because of what Jesus did for you and I on the cross.

721
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,340
 This idea that confession,

722
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,780
 that hey, you're going in the way of sin,

723
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,040
 and you turn around

724
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,340
 and you go in the opposite direction of your sin,

725
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,460
 like you don't do a 360

726
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,060
 and go back into the same direction of your sin.

727
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,620
 It's turning from sin and turning to him.

728
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,820
 And this idea of belief,

729
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,500
 it's not this intellectual belief

730
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,980
 that I had for 22 years of my life.

731
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,140
 See, what we know is men and women always say

732
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,780
 what they think, but they do what they believe.

733
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,860
 You know this to be true.

734
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,240
 You wanna know what someone believes?

735
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
 Just watch how they live their life.

736
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,140
 You know that to be true.

737
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,500
 I know that to be true.

738
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:47,420
 So Jesus did what no man could ever do.

739
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,140
 In summary, good works can't save us,

740
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,820
 religion can't either,

741
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
 but only through what Jesus has done for you and I

742
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,000
 on the cross through his resurrection can we be born again.

743
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,420
 Like this is my story, y'all.

744
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:09,980
 Junior year in college, playing baseball,

745
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,500
 everything I worked so hard for

746
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,660
 was finally starting to fall into place.

747
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,100
 I was getting off the bus from playing a three-game series,

748
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,460
 about to get ready to go out to the party,

749
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,220
 and I got hit.

750
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,360
 I mean it, like this is crazy.

751
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,980
 And I just, I had this question come over me, is that it?

752
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,380
 'Cause if these things aren't gonna do it anymore,

753
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
 what's gonna do it?

754
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,620
 If this baseball that I'm pursuing and having success in

755
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,260
 isn't gonna do it anymore, what's it gonna do?

756
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,940
 'Cause I began to be empty and unsatisfied, unfulfilled,

757
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,460
 and I was like, man, I'm just gonna go to the party,

758
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,420
 I'm gonna do what I always do,

759
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,820
 and it's gonna fill me up.

760
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,900
 And in that moment I said, but it's not.

761
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,460
 And so I went right down the list

762
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,200
 with everything I was feeling in my life with this girl,

763
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,200
 these drugs, this bottle, this party, this porn,

764
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,780
 and I just was self-indulging.

765
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,500
 And I remember moments back, I had a Bible next to my bed,

766
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,440
 and I remember when I'd feel guilty enough,

767
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,680
 sometimes I'd open that thing,

768
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,160
 and then the next day I'd go to church,

769
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,300
 and I just kinda went through rinse and repeat,

770
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,960
 rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat,

771
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,740
 but nothing really ever changed in my life.

772
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,460
 Until that night.

773
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,300
 And I said, God, I don't know if you're real,

774
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,580
 but you gotta reveal yourself to me,

775
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,540
 because the things that I'm chasing in this world

776
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,540
 aren't fulfilling this man that thought he had everything.

777
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,180
 Ranked number seventh in the nation,

778
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,700
 having one of the best years of my life,

779
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,060
 and I'm like, hey, I thought that's what was gonna do it,

780
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,340
 that's what the world tells me.

781
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,600
 That's what the world says is gonna fulfill me.

782
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,820
 Why am I empty?

783
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,500
 Why am I still thinking that there's more out there?

784
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,660
 Because God says I've written eternity

785
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,820
 in the hearts of every man and every woman.

786
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:05,240
 And tonight, he's written eternity on your heart,

787
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,380
 and you've been going through the motions week in

788
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,020
 and week out, and trying a little bit of Jesus

789
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,060
 and a little bit of the world,

790
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,260
 and can I just say, that's a miserable place.

791
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,340
 Like it was for me.

792
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:26,840
 And I cried out to God that night,

793
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,940
 and I said, God, will you reveal yourself to me?

794
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,780
 And over the next few days, God began to show me

795
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,720
 this message that we just talked about tonight.

796
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,060
 Man, God, chasm of separation,

797
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,140
 because of our sin,

798
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,420
 the bridges that I was trying to build,

799
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,820
 good works, religion, fall short, and hell.

800
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,860
 God in his goodness sends Jesus on a rescue mission

801
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:07,300
 to die on the cross for the sins of humanity.

802
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,900
 And not only that, he rose again

803
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,460
 to defeat the very thing that hung under the tree.

804
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,380
 That is one of the most beautiful messages

805
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,580
 I've ever heard or seen, and something in me

806
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,980
 over the next few days began to well up.

807
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,960
 And I said, this message is different.

808
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,500
 I studied the other religions.

809
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:37,220
 I studied Muslim, Mormonism.

810
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,180
 I studied a lot Hindu.

811
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,660
 I studied them.

812
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,540
 And they all teach that you have to climb the ladder

813
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,940
 to get to God.

814
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,540
 But God in his love and his goodness

815
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,820
 stepped into our mess, and he did

816
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,080
 what no man has ever done.

817
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,180
 He died for you.

818
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,100
 And if that message doesn't move you,

819
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,900
 and you're still waiting for more of a sign,

820
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,140
 you're still waiting for an experience,

821
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,140
 you're still waiting for God to maybe give you

822
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,580
 what you want, then listen, the cross

823
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,280
 will never be enough for you.

824
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,640
 And if the cross is never enough for you,

825
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
 then Jesus will never be enough for you.

826
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,700
 And so where are you at?

827
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,140
 Where are you at with God tonight?

828
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,780
 On a scale of one to 10, if 10 is,

829
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:42,100
 hey, I'm in, I'm all in with God.

830
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
 This is you, humanity.

831
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:50,900
 Man, woman, I'm all in, 10, I'm committed to Jesus.

832
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,500
 I've crossed over, not because of what I've done,

833
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,000
 but because of what he's done.

834
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,640
 Or one, man, I'm not anywhere near.

835
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,620
 Not anywhere near, I'm over here

836
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,380
 on the other side of the chasm, Josiah.

837
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,940
 Or maybe I'm a five.

838
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,580
 I'm kind of there.

839
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,860
 Like 50%, let me ask you, did Jesus die

840
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,140
 for 50% of your sin?

841
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,000
 He died for 100%, amen.

842
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,180
 Where are you at tonight?

843
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,380
 On a scale of one to 10.

844
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,100
 And let me tell you something,

845
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
 10 doesn't mean that you're perfect.

846
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,740
 Let me just show that, right now,

847
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,180
 just before we close, 10 doesn't mean

848
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,340
 that you're just perfect and you never fall into anything.

849
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,300
 No, no, 10 means that you're struggling well,

850
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,260
 that when you fall into it,

851
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,280
 there's a conviction that comes over you

852
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,900
 that leads you to repentance,

853
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,480
 that leads you to have a change of heart,

854
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,340
 that leads you to have a change of behavior,

855
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,380
 and you're struggling well.

856
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,580
 And you have a group of men or a group of women

857
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,980
 that you begin to confess that sin to,

858
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,660
 and they begin to come alongside of you

859
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,020
 and help you grow to be God's man or God's woman.

860
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,100
 But you know your hardest of hearts,

861
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,960
 if you're faking it, I did.

862
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,700
 You know if you come into this place

863
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,540
 and you sing love songs to God

864
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,300
 and you listen to message after message,

865
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,380
 and nothing has moved you,

866
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,440
 that's not a 10.

867
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,300
 Nothing has really changed.

868
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,380
 There's no broken pattern.

869
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,620
 You look back at your sin,

870
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,380
 and there's no broken patterns of that sin in your life,

871
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,700
 'cause you keep going right back to it,

872
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,460
 right back to it, right back to it.

873
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,820
 (congregation murmurs)

874
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,060
 Where are you at tonight?

875
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,620
 With every head bowed and every eye closed,

876
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,900
 as a sign of humility before God,

877
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,160
 and to limit distractions, I wanna ask you a question.

878
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,000
 If you're anything less than a 10,

879
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,660
 (congregation murmurs)

880
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,600
 if you are anything less than a 10 tonight,

881
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,120
 would you raise your hand?

882
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,880
 I just wanna pray for you.

883
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,840
 I just wanna pray for your hands

884
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,560
 going all the way up in this room tonight.

885
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
 Golly, this is crazy.

886
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,820
 I just wanna pray.

887
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,040
 I see that hand, I see that hand.

888
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,520
 Hands going all up in this room tonight.

889
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,860
 (congregation murmurs)

890
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,880
 If you're anything less than a 10,

891
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,240
 is there any reason why you wouldn't make a decision tonight

892
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,080
 to follow him?

893
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:50,520
 And here's what I know.

894
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,600
 Every time Jesus called someone to follow him,

895
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,580
 he called them publicly.

896
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,480
 Like your faith might be personal,

897
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,720
 but it is not private.

898
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,160
 Did you hear me?

899
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,440
 Your faith might be personal, but it is not private.

900
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,920
 Every time Jesus called someone to follow him,

901
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,120
 he called them publicly.

902
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,560
 And so tonight, I'm gonna ask you

903
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,800
 to do something really, really bold.

904
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,640
 Like we don't do this,

905
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,440
 and listen, we're not gonna belabor this moment,

906
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,140
 we're not gonna drag this thing on,

907
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,560
 but we're gonna give you an opportunity

908
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,680
 to commit your life to Jesus.

909
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,960
 Tonight is your night, and it's nights like these

910
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,120
 that define your faith,

911
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,360
 and they're defining moments in your life

912
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,660
 where you draw a line in the sand,

913
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,460
 you nail a stake in the ground, and you cross over.

914
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,780
 The Bible would say, "From death to life,

915
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,860
 "for the wages of sin is death,"

916
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,780
 Romans 6:23 says, "But the free gift of God

917
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,180
 "is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord."

918
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,160
 Father God, you know the hands

919
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,980
 that went up in this place tonight.

920
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,540
 And I pray,

921
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,660
 under the sound of my voice,

922
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,620
 and hopefully it's not my voice teaching tonight,

923
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,580
 but your voice,

924
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,900
 that my friends would be bold

925
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,180
 with their decision

926
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,240
 to follow you.

927
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,500
 And God, that you would allow them to see

928
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,460
 that the message of the gospel,

929
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,180
 the good news,

930
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,100
 the way that we can be born again

931
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,340
 through your faith

932
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:32,340
 is through this simple idea of confessing

933
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,660
 plus believing in what you did for us

934
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,180
 that will be enough to make us right with you,

935
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,660
 and for us to enter into the kingdom of heaven

936
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,900
 like Nicodemus was asking in that passage.

937
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,420
 Would that be enough in their life

938
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,380
 that they would confess you as Lord

939
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,740
 and turn from their sin

940
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,660
 and that they would believe

941
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,900
 in the only one worthy of our praise, Jesus Christ,

942
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,060
 and you would awaken the hearts in this place

943
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,860
 that when they walk out of these doors,

944
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,260
 that they would be transformed

945
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,260
 and that they would be with you

946
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:18,160
 forever and ever and ever and ever in heaven.

947
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,180
 Lord, would you do that work that no man can do,

948
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
 and we'll be sure to give you the glory.

949
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,420
 In Jesus' name, amen.
