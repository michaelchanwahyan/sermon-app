[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.220]   All right, how we doing, Parch?
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.720]   Last week of the Insta-Theology series
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.680]   that we're in the middle of,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.160]   and let me just tell you, man,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.600]   the internet, it's not reliable.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.120]   You just can't trust it, as is evidenced by the fact
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.960]   that we're joining all our Ports locations
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.360]   a little late tonight, so we apologize.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.340]   There's been some technical stuff.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760]   That's why we did a little more worship here
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   in the Dallas area and kind of drug ourselves
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.800]   through the announcements, and JD, if you weren't here,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.340]   all these other locations gave himself a dating shout-out,
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.920]   which was totally out of bounds, but he did it anyway.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.400]   So, but anyway, man, it's great to finally be hooked up
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.120]   with you guys and all the other campuses,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.640]   and we're gonna talk about how to hook you up
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.160]   with some truth tonight.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.000]   That's what we're doing.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.680]   We love that we're diving in together.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   We've been talking about Insta-Theology,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.320]   these little phrases, these slogans that are thrown at us
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.520]   that can inform us in so many ways,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.200]   and tonight, we're gonna be talking about the phrase
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600]   kind of follow your dreams, right?
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.840]   Follow your heart, follow your passions.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.000]   You gotta go for it, right?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.920]   Live your life.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   You do you.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.880]   There's a thousand ways to say it,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.320]   but what we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.560]   is this is a really wisdom in there.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   Should we follow our heart?
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.120]   Should we follow our genes?
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.200]   Should we trace what seems right to us?
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   Well, let me just start with just a few of these little
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.960]   posts that are out there.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.320]   You've seen 'em, right?
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.120]   But here's a few that you're gonna run into
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   when you go along the way, man.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.560]   Follow your dreams, right?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.240]   And the universe will open for you
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.360]   where there previously were only walls.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.220]   Man, you gotta read that, and you're like, yes.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.240]   That's what I'm saying right there.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.640]   I'm down with that, okay?
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.000]   Or how about this one, follow your dreams.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   They know the way.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.040]   That makes sense, right?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.880]   How about this?
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.680]   Hey, sometimes, sometimes life is about
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   risking everything for a dream no one can see but you.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   Right, man, you're sitting there,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   you're scrolling through your phone,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   you're like, yes, yes, I believe that.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.240]   I'm down with that.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.480]   The biggest, this is Oprah, Oprah's gonna chime in,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.920]   the biggest adventure you can take
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   is to live the life of your dreams.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.240]   Oprah is on Instagram, okay?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.720]   And so she apparently saw this other post
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.560]   and she's laying it on you.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.520]   It's Oprah now, so it's not just some random post out there.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.080]   That's Oprah.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   Walt Disney, if you can dream it, you can do it.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   Tinkerbell, come on, you can do it.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.760]   Just flap those little fairy wings
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.920]   and we're gonna go somewhere.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560]   How about this one, Barbara Shurer, she says,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   as soon as you begin to pursue a dream,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.780]   your life wakes up and everything has meaning.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.320]   I mean, that's just like, yes.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   Say that to me again, give it to me.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.120]   Steve Jobs, okay, that's coming to the practical,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.000]   coming to reality.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.680]   Have the courage to follow your heart.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.000]   Steve Jobs famously, in a way that impacted a generation
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.800]   when he was at Stanford, kind of gave a message
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.640]   and he just talked about, I mean,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.400]   you find a job that you love
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.560]   and he didn't finish it with a phrase,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.880]   you'll never work a day in your life,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.800]   but that's what he was implying right there.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.240]   He just told them, have the courage
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.000]   to follow your heart and intuition.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Then somehow know, they, you know,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.280]   your dreams, your intuition, somehow it knows,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.600]   he says, what you truly want to become.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   I don't know, is that true?
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.000]   How about this one?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   You know, this guy follows dreams.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.200]   Yesterday I really wanted tacos,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.040]   and now I'm eating tacos.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.360]   Follow your dreams.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.280]   Oh, now that one, okay, that one I'm gonna endorse
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.480]   right there, okay?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Dream about tacos and have yourself a taco.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.160]   That one will work.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.440]   Everything else, though, might need a little help.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.660]   Listen, some of those ideas, you know,
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.960]   they are a bit inspiring.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   They might get you, you know, wondering a little bit
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.680]   to where you get out of your just kind of
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.960]   little work-a-day world or just kind of believe
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.840]   that all I can be is all anybody's ever told me.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   And what I want to share with you tonight
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.120]   is you don't need insta-theology.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.720]   I mean, you need real theology.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.080]   There's a real God, and he's really there,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.920]   and he really loves you, and he's not looking
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.320]   to rip you off.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.580]   He is looking to set you free.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.120]   This God loves you so much that he came to rescue you
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.680]   from a way that seems right to you,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.640]   but in the end, it leads to death.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.280]   Those are his words, not mine.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.440]   He wants to rescue you from having to learn
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   through experiencing, from having to kind of
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.440]   make your way through the dark.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.840]   Plato, I mean, this is not new to your generation.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.560]   This has been going on for a long time.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.160]   Plato, okay, the great philosopher, he said,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.200]   "Listen, man, until we hear a still more sure word
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.080]   "from God," this is what philosophers,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.240]   philosopher, philo means love, you know, Sophia, wisdom,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.160]   lovers of wisdom, that's where the word philosophy
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.120]   comes from, lovers of wisdom have always said
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.440]   what Plato said, "Until we hear a sure more word
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.760]   "from God, we're gonna be like two barks,"
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.640]   is the word he used, but it's the word that means ships,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.200]   "We're gonna be like two ships, you know, making its way
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.120]   "through an ocean at night in the middle of a storm."
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.800]   What's Shakespeare, what's Plato saying there?
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.000]   Plato's saying, look, if you're a ship on the ocean
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.300]   at night in a storm, I mean, there's nothing to guide you.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.320]   There's no truth anchored in the heavens, right?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.720]   Because if you're on the ocean at night and you're in a ship,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.440]   and you're gonna look up at the stars, okay?
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.760]   And not the planets, planets, the word planet
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.740]   comes from the word that literally means wanderer.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.640]   Don't fix your future course on what wanders, what moves,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.440]   but fix your future on what is anchored and true.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.200]   And you follow what's up there, but if it's a storm
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.360]   at night and it's dark, Plato ends his quote by saying,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000]   "All we can do is trust in the best opinions of men."
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.800]   And he goes, that's trouble.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.520]   Every philosopher, lovers of wisdom, would love
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.280]   a more sure word from God.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.560]   You don't need instant theology
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.320]   when you can get real theology.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.680]   When you can get literally God's word,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.860]   that's what that means, theos, God, logos, word,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.000]   the word of God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.500]   And so what we're trying to do is just lovingly share
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.320]   with you so you don't have to kind of pick your way
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.240]   through life.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.320]   I've got lots of folks, you know, now that are kind
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.600]   of my generation and we're a lifetime and a half ahead
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.240]   of you, most of the folks that are dropping in on this.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.600]   And I can now tell you with a little bit more experience
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.160]   that insta-theology, we didn't have Instagram,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.800]   we didn't have any even social media, it wasn't around,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.960]   but man, there were slogans that they fed us
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.760]   and that many of us formed our life on.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.820]   I've got lots of buddies that have succeeded
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.340]   in following their dreams or attaining success
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.180]   and doing things at the highest pinnacles of life.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.580]   I used to walk the class with Brad Pitt, all right?
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.900]   He and I went to college together.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.300]   We lived next to each other and I can remember, you know,
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.460]   Brad kind of making his way.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.660]   Cheryl Crowe and I hung out in college and we were friends.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.580]   We were at a concert together on a date
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.100]   and I was sitting there, she looked at me,
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.820]   she just elbowed me, she goes, "Man, I'm gonna do that.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.500]   "I'm gonna do that one day."
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.340]   And she did.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.940]   But she did a lot of other things
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.620]   because following the dreams and Cheryl was gifted
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.340]   and Brad had talent, even then, I can just tell you,
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.620]   I've watched a lot of their journey through life
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.340]   and getting the success of their dreams and their visions,
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.500]   it doesn't always work out in the way
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.540]   that you think it will.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.460]   I mean, this is my friend Brad, this is what he says to you.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.280]   Listen to him.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.300]   He says in an interview with Rolling Stone,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.460]   "Man, I know all these things are supposed
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.140]   "to seem important, car, the condo, our version of success,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.480]   "but if that's the case, why is the general feeling
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.160]   "out there reflecting more impotence and isolation
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.220]   "and desperation and loneliness?
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.700]   "If you ask me, I say toss it all.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.540]   "We gotta find something else.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.380]   "Because all I know is at this point in time,
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.020]   "we're heading for a dead end, a numbing of the soul,
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.480]   "a complete atrophy of the spiritual being
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.660]   "and I don't want that," he says.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.700]   So the Rolling Stone Magazine interviewer said this,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.840]   "So man, if we're heading toward this kind of existential,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.460]   "dead-ended society, if the follow our dreams
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.980]   "and follow your heart's desires isn't the thing,
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.140]   "then what's the thing?"
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.980]   They ask him.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.280]   What do you think should happen?
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.180]   This is Brad Pitt.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.300]   Listen, you need to know something.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.380]   Brad danced with spiritual truths.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:38.240]   He was around theology, but it never became his theology.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.060]   But watch what happens when you don't learn
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   by humbling yourself.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.620]   You're gonna learn by being humbled.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   And so here's my humble friend.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.380]   He says, "Hey man, I don't know.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.340]   "I don't know."
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.920]   But the emphasis now is so much on success and personal gain,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.580]   I'm sitting in it.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.380]   I'm telling you, it's just not it.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.660]   I'm the guy who's got everything.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.640]   I know, but I'm telling you, once you've got everything,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.420]   then really all you've got left is yourself.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.380]   I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.040]   It doesn't help you sleep any better.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.380]   And you don't wake up any better because of it.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.940]   It's just a humble truth right there.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.860]   Michael Jordan, who's also of my generation,
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.200]   Michael Jordan was told at one time by GQ Magazine
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.600]   that when all the guys who subscribed to that magazine,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.620]   when it was at the zenith of its being a big deal,
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.500]   they were asked the question,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   "If you could be anybody for a year, who would it be?"
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.540]   And all the guys that subscribed to that magazine
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.500]   put all their answers in, they compiled them all up,
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.740]   and the answer was Michael Jordan.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.860]   I wanna be Michael Jordan.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.060]   And they went to Michael Jordan, they go,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.900]   "Hey bro, what do you think?
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.740]   "What's that like to be the guy that if guys
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.740]   "could be any guy they wanted to be for a year,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.740]   "that they could be me, be you?"
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.180]   And Jordan said, "Well, that doesn't surprise me."
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.480]   He goes, "But make them be me for five years."
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.380]   And you know, after a while, they're gonna find out
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.720]   that all the restaurants, all the doors opening,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.820]   all the women opening to you, all the things you want,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.940]   it just doesn't satisfy.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.860]   Make them be me for longer.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.100]   Let's see what they want.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.340]   You see, here's the thing.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.580]   You're going to be you your entire life.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.300]   And so what you gotta figure out is,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.020]   is there something I can follow that's a blessing to me?
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.540]   Let me just let you read from one of your own generation
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.540]   who experienced a whole lot of success early on in life.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.580]   My man, Justin Bieber, right?
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.140]   You've heard Justin, did you see his Insta post recently?
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.920]   All right, just watch this.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.460]   I mean, it's a little long, but I want you to hear
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.380]   from the philosophers of your day.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.520]   Said it's hard to get out of bed in the morning
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.180]   with the right attitude when you're overwhelmed
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.000]   with your life.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.840]   You ever felt like that?
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.700]   This is Justin Bieber.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.980]   How's he overwhelmed with his life?
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.820]   Well, listen.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.460]   Man, your past, your job, your responsibilities,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.620]   your emotions, your family, your finances and relationships,
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.140]   when it feels like there's trouble after trouble
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.580]   after trouble, you start foreseeing the day
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.380]   through a lens of dread.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.220]   Wow.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.700]   And sometimes, just all you can do is anticipate
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.580]   another bad day, a cycle of feeling disappointment
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.420]   after disappointment.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.340]   Sometimes it can get you to the point
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.540]   where you can't even want to live anymore.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.980]   Can you believe that?
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.860]   That life, where you feel like it's never going to change.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.500]   He says, well, I can fully sympathize with you.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.860]   I could not change my mindset.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.700]   I was stuck.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.780]   I was following my dreams.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.420]   I was actually living your dream.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   I got sucked up, he's gonna go on to tell you,
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.180]   in a vortex of the world exploiting me,
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.880]   and I was living what you guys thought was your dream.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.940]   He goes, but I'm fortunate now to have people in my life
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.820]   that continue to encourage me to keep me going.
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.720]   You see, I got money, I got clothes, I got cars,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.740]   I got accolades, I got achievements, I got awards,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.860]   and I was still, listen to this, 30 years before Brad,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.940]   in the same interview, I still didn't have it.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.240]   'Cause I had this insta thing that was promising me
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.620]   something that doesn't give you anything.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.420]   Have you noticed the statistics of child stars
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.460]   and the outcome of their life?
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.940]   There's an insane pressure and responsibility
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.660]   put on the child's brain, emotions,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.700]   and frontal lobes, decision-making abilities
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.620]   aren't developed yet.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.860]   No rationality, they're defiant, they're rebellious,
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.900]   things all of us have got to go through to learn,
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.180]   but when you add the pressure of stardom,
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.020]   it does something to you that is quite unexplainable.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.300]   Listen, you see, I didn't grow up in a stable home.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.400]   My parents were separated when I was young,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.260]   with no money, still young and rebellious as well.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.100]   Because why?
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   Because my dad's passion wasn't to stay committed to my mom.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.400]   He followed his heart right away from being my dad.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.800]   And there was a vulnerability, a wound there.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.300]   As my talent progressed, he said,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.440]   I became ultra-successful.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   It happened within a strand of two years.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.240]   My whole world was flipped on its head.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   I went from a 13-year-old boy from a small town
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.720]   to being praised left and right by the world
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.320]   with millions saying how much they loved me
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.420]   and how great I was.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.640]   Isn't that your dream?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.040]   I don't know about you, but humility comes with age, man.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.880]   It sure does.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.320]   You do these things enough as a young boy
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.360]   and you actually start believing it.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.800]   Rationality comes with age
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.640]   and so does your decision-making process.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.120]   One of the reasons you can't drink until you're 21.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.280]   Just in search right there.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.560]   Everyone did everything for me,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.320]   so I never learned the fundamentals of responsibility.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.120]   So by this point, I was 18 with no skills in the real world,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.680]   with millions of dollars and access to whatever I wanted.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   And this can be very scary.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.000]   You're like, wait a minute, that's my dream.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.520]   And what he's gone through to say
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.800]   is don't make it your dream.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.840]   I'm just gonna fast forward.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.780]   You can go back and find it.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.560]   I think this was around Labor Day he posted this
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   to 119 million followers.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.200]   And I hope they followed him
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.920]   because here's what he says in the last paragraph.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.200]   He said, "I started doing pretty heavy drugs at 19
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.560]   "and abused all of my relationships.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.600]   "I became resentful, disrespectful to women and angry.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.240]   "I became distant to everyone who loved me.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.520]   "I was hiding behind a shell of a person that I'd become.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.060]   "I felt like I could never turn it around.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.520]   "It's taken me years to bounce back
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.680]   "from all these terrible decisions,
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.240]   "fixed, broken relationships, changed relational habits.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.480]   "And luckily, man, God blessed me
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.840]   "with extraordinarily kind people who love me for me.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.900]   "And now I'm navigating the best season of my life.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.380]   "It's marriage, which is an amazing,
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.140]   "crazy new responsibility, but watch this.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.980]   "It ain't easy.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.060]   "It takes patience and trust and commitment
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.240]   "and kindness and humility
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.340]   "and all the things it looks like to be a good man."
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.540]   Watch.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.940]   All this to say, keep fighting.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.620]   Jesus loves you.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.620]   Now, isn't that amazing?
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.820]   Isn't that amazing that one of your contemporaries
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   who frankly isn't chasing a dream, he has lived the dream.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.780]   I'm just living the dream.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.100]   He's saying, "Listen, man, you gotta wake up
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.240]   "'cause the dreams that we're chasing
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.040]   "sometimes turn into nightmares.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.540]   "Some of you guys are experiencing that
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.700]   "and you wish you could just wake up and get out of it,
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.300]   "but you're stuck in the same way that Justin was stuck
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.160]   "and there's just something there
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.500]   "that's not working out for you."
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.100]   And I gotta tell you, I know why.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.380]   It's because there's an insta-theology out there
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.780]   that doesn't work, that you've just been sucked into.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.620]   I'm gonna tell you another.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.540]   Here's some real theology, okay?
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.660]   This is some theology.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.400]   This is God who loves you.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.860]   This is the one that Justin said,
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.980]   "Listen, man, don't chase what I chased."
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.180]   It doesn't mean don't use your talent.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.080]   It doesn't mean don't believe
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.060]   that maybe you can go out there and get a break.
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.620]   He's just saying, "Don't count on that break making you."
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.420]   Because stardom doesn't make you.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.100]   God makes you and God loves you and he's good.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.320]   And the reason your life is as hurting as his was
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.300]   with all that success is because it doesn't matter
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.780]   if you have success or no success.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.940]   The question is, do you know God?
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.920]   Do you have good words from God that inform you?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.620]   I got some good news for you, man.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.780]   It's not like this is a mystery.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.540]   You gotta climb, you know, go rent a yak and find a Sherpa
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.060]   and climb up some mountain
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.820]   and find some mysterious cave somewhere
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.140]   where you can sit down with a wise man
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.420]   who might give you a little bit of time.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.100]   This is amazing.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.260]   God is more anxious to reveal to you his heart
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.860]   than you'll ever be to seek him.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:09.380]   He wants to give to you as a loving father
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.180]   what you need and what you can follow.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.940]   You don't need a slogan, you need a savior
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.620]   because all of us are born into this rebellious little,
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.620]   I got this, I don't need you life.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.140]   And when we see that there's a way that seems right to us
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.780]   that leads to death, we finally humble ourself and go,
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.580]   hey God, could you love me still?
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.060]   And his answer is yes.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.260]   I've demonstrated my love for you
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.020]   and that while you were still a little rebellious,
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.380]   insta-spontaneous, self-absorbed, no-theology individual,
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.300]   I gave my life for you so you could see a word from God.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.060]   This is who his word is, he's love.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.420]   And he cares for you.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.620]   And he's not gonna just dismiss your sin.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.740]   And so he had to figure out a way to deal with that
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.060]   and he dealt with it by himself becoming sin for you
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.300]   that you could be reconciled to him
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.220]   and this is what he says.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.380]   I want you to remember the words of Justin
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.820]   and the words of Brad and now listen to the words
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.780]   of a guy who knew God and the wisdom that comes from God.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.500]   This is in Proverbs three.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.420]   I'll just pick you up right there
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.620]   in the middle of the chapter and in verse 13,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.540]   do you remember what they both said?
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.060]   It's despairing, it's depressing and I can't sleep well.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.740]   It's just not the key.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.580]   Watch this, how blessed is the man who finds wisdom.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.100]   The man, the woman, the human that gains understanding
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.420]   for the profit of wisdom is better than the profit of silver
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.900]   and her gain better than fine gold.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.340]   How amazing would it have been for Brad
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.860]   to use all of his acting talent
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.940]   and known this instead of thinking
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.980]   that maybe his acting talent and his good looks
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.780]   and his fame could have gotten him peace.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.500]   See, he had the chance, okay?
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.940]   He wasn't around anything exactly like the porch
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.620]   but he was around this.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:07.500]   But this never sunk in here and so he had to learn, man.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.580]   He had to learn by climbing mountains
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.060]   and realizing that in the mountain,
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.540]   the air was thin and it chokes you,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.740]   there's no life there.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.860]   And I think if he was here, he'd tell you,
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.780]   why don't you learn, man,
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.020]   before you start climbing the wrong mountain.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.860]   Watch this, long life is in her right hand
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.940]   and in her left hand are real riches and honor.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:36.260]   Her ways are pleasant ways and her paths are peace.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.940]   See, can I just ask you this?
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.100]   I mean, I can tell you by the grace of God about your age,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.820]   I mean, I was all in with Jesus
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.060]   and so life wasn't easy.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.100]   I didn't get married till I was 27.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.380]   It wasn't like it was just all falling right in or 28.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.740]   You know, but some of you guys are like,
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.820]   well, I'm 32, Todd.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.940]   I'd say it doesn't matter.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.460]   I can tell you that it can still be a pleasant way
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.140]   and peaceful way when you know the way
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.660]   you're supposed to live and who you're supposed to live with.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.940]   I mean, Jesus is enough, he's sufficient.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.220]   Watch this, wisdom that God gives is a tree of life
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.340]   to all those who take hold of her
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.180]   and happier all who hold fast.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.300]   The Lord by wisdom founded the earth.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.660]   By understanding, he established the heavens.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.260]   By his knowledge, the deeps were broken up,
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260]   the skies were due.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.740]   Watch this, so my son, listen, don't let,
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.660]   don't let them vanish from your sight.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.660]   Keep sound wisdom and discretion
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.340]   so there'll be life to your soul
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.780]   and adornment to your neck.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.020]   It's just, it's the most beautiful thing
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.780]   that somebody could wear, which is to live life
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.360]   the way God wants you to live life.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.700]   It's beautiful, it makes you beautiful.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.200]   And you'll walk securely.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.380]   Watch this, your foot won't stumble.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.620]   Do you remember what Brad said?
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.220]   Remember what Justin said?
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.480]   When you lie down, you won't be afraid.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.820]   And when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:01.060]   Don't be afraid of sudden fear and of the onslaught
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.380]   of the wicked when it comes, no.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.220]   For the Lord will be your confidence
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.740]   and will keep your foot from being caught.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.880]   I mean, that's some theology for you.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.360]   I'm just gonna tell you that that isn't just words
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.360]   from a guy who had also kind of done
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.560]   what Brad and Justin had done later in his life.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.620]   And he came back to saying, I just wish I would have,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.100]   I wrote those words and I deviated from 'em.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.000]   I was around this truth and I didn't walk in those ways.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.280]   And so the guy who wrote that wrote another book
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.160]   called Ecclesiastes where he lived the life of our dreams.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.640]   He was a hedonist, he was wealthy, he was a womanizer.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.740]   I mean, he had power, he had it all.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.900]   And he said, vanity, it's all vanity.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.060]   There's no life there.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.320]   And he came back and he said,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.220]   this is the secret of wisdom in your youth.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.620]   Learn to fear God.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.860]   That doesn't mean like be scared of God.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.140]   Learn to know how good God is that it would just horrify you
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.820]   that you wouldn't let him inform your 20s.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.740]   Because he makes 20s beautiful.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.800]   And 30s beautiful, and 40s beautiful, and 50s beautiful.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.900]   That's who our God is.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.940]   Let me just give you one more thing
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.940]   and I'm gonna give you some real practical stuff tonight too.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.560]   And I was thinking about this as a guy
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.780]   who is part of Gen Y.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.020]   So just a reminder, Gen Y are anybody that's born
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.860]   between 1980 and 1994.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.500]   That's most of the folks that are tracking with me right now
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.340]   and listening.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.420]   This guy is a computer science prof
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.820]   at Georgetown University.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.340]   And he was just watching how a bunch of your contemporaries
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.900]   and your peers were struggling at work.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.420]   Because we think that, man, I'm supposed to chase my dreams
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.220]   and live my passion and find what I love.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.020]   If I don't love my work in year one or month one,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.780]   then this must not be where I'm supposed to work.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.000]   And we're jettisoning careers and we're not satisfied
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.200]   because we thought work would make us happy.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.780]   And work is good, work doesn't make you happy.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.500]   Can I tell you something else?
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.960]   I mean, happy is good, but happy doesn't make you happy.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.620]   Happy is what you experience
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.020]   when it's generally going well with you.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.180]   And what I wanna offer you is not insta-happy,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.180]   I wanna offer you blessedness.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.240]   That word blessedness is the word be happy.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.180]   It's a deep and abiding happy.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.480]   But here's the thing, the world is lying to you
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.500]   and it's giving you a false theology.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.940]   And it's not your fault because your society,
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.360]   your world, the one that my generation
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.060]   largely has offered to you is a world
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.700]   that has jettisoned the basic teachings of God who loves you
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.140]   which is called the Judeo-Christian ethic.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.020]   Even people who don't know God
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.460]   but who do what God wants them to do generally do better.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.060]   This is not health, wealth, and prosperity,
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.940]   but it is, it's going to be a better life.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.940]   And part of that betterness is when trouble hits you,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.860]   you're not haunted by the thought
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.700]   that I brought this on myself.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.820]   You know, the very first week of the Insta series
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.020]   where we kind of talked about the good vibes,
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.220]   health, wealth, and prosperity, nonsense, and lie.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.420]   I was up here, I went to teach at the porch that night,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.220]   but I was walking back through and some of you grabbed me
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.780]   and they go, "Man, I just wish I could know
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.660]   "that it was gonna be okay."
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.900]   And I kind of like that offer of good vibes,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.260]   health, wealth, and prosperity gospel
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.140]   because if I just live the way that they tell me to live,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.160]   I wanna know it's gonna work out well for me.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.200]   I go, "But listen, it's a lie.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.420]   "It's a lie that if you give God 1,000,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.660]   "he'll return it to 10,000.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.360]   "It's a lie that if you have enough faith
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.960]   "that cancer will go away or that man will come
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.240]   "or that woman will say yes.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.340]   "It's a lie, it doesn't always happen.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.840]   "It's not a faith problem.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.140]   "It's just part of being in a world
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.940]   "where sometimes things that you want to go a certain way
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.160]   "don't go the right way, but here's the peace.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.380]   "You want promised peace?
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.680]   "Here's how you can get it.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.860]   "You can order your life in humility before God
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.020]   "so in this world still wracked with trouble,
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.680]   "when trouble comes, you're not laying in bed
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.300]   "kicking yourself because you brought
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.960]   "the trouble on yourself.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.300]   "In fact, God's even told you
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.180]   "that in him you'll have peace,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.920]   "but in the world you'll have trouble.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.060]   "The world will offer you fleeting moments of peace,
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.360]   "but then trouble's gonna come,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.460]   "and if you don't have something to explain the trouble
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.500]   "that's here in this world,"
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.880]   and guess why there's trouble in the world?
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   Because our world lives according to an insta-theology.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.740]   Our world lives according to lies.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.480]   And when you expect lies to deliver
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.520]   something truly wonderful, you're gonna be disappointed.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.680]   And so God calls you to follow him and believe in him,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.760]   and what gives you peace is that if you live your life well
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   and things don't break out,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.520]   you know that this life is not your home.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.320]   You know that God's gonna reward those who are faithful.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.800]   And worst case scenario,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.440]   you're talking about a few decades
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.940]   that will have you standing before the one
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.920]   whose opinion matters and he's gonna look at you
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.820]   and goes, "Look, I know it was hard.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.000]   "I know health didn't come your way.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.600]   "I know you spent your life in a wheelchair.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.820]   "I know you never were met with somebody
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.780]   "who told you they loved you and cherished and nourished you,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.160]   "but you were satisfied in me,
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.000]   "and you showed others the sufficiency of who I am,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.280]   "and welcome, my beloved."
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.120]   You might go, "Todd, I'm not interested in that."
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.320]   And I'm telling you, you ought to be,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.040]   because there's all kinds of folks
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.600]   who have that ring in their left hand,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.120]   who bought the lie that, man,
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.520]   if a great relationship is 100, right?
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.880]   And so I'm single, that's a zero.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.360]   So even a bad marriage, a four,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.320]   is four degrees better than where I'm at.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.440]   Hey, that's a lie.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   Being single is not a zero.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.120]   You need to realize that if you're gonna do that,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.200]   what you gotta realize is that being single
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.640]   and sufficient with God is just zero, okay?
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.540]   A bad relationship is a negative 100,
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.840]   and you don't want that pain.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.400]   But it's not a zero.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.520]   He's enough.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.000]   And what you want is to learn to walk with him
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.200]   and be satisfied in him, and you find somebody else
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.000]   who walks with him and is satisfied with him,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.400]   and even though they're frail and they make mistakes,
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.640]   when they make mistakes, they own it
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.280]   and they repent of it, and together,
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.400]   you guys are working towards the 100,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.120]   which is being home with Jesus,
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   the only one that won't disappoint.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.640]   You don't need to follow your passions,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.120]   you need to follow Jesus.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.400]   Here's what happened in your generation.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.960]   You kind of bought the lie.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.080]   There's a thing called Google's Ngram Viewer.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.720]   I'm gonna show you a chart in just a minute.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.000]   Google's Ngram Viewer, I don't even know this existed,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.200]   but Google, which is just an amazing processor
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.880]   of information, it tracks words and phrases
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.520]   that make their way into literature,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.600]   into print, into human discourse.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.840]   And what I want you to see, remember,
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.040]   Gen Y was born in 1980, and then, you know,
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.160]   or through 1994, which means your formative years,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.600]   okay, for most of you, were early 2000s,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.200]   late '90s, early 2000s.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.180]   Okay, so watch this.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.180]   This is the Google Ngram Viewer for the phrase,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.020]   follow your passion.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.320]   Take a look at this.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.280]   This phrase, throughout human history,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.120]   was used at a very minuscule level.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.440]   And then, along about 1994, all the way to 2008,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.480]   follow your passion, we started saying that all the time
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.080]   to you.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.900]   Why?
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.640]   Because your parents worked hard,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.480]   and they had to get in the, you know, workaday world,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.880]   and now they prospered, and they go,
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.920]   so now, we want you to live your dreams.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.360]   You do you.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.720]   And what you're finding is that doesn't work.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.540]   Do you know this?
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.720]   For the first time since the Spanish influenza,
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.020]   life expectancy in America has gone down
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.080]   three years in a row.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   We are the wealthiest and most prosperous country
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.480]   we have ever been, and life expectancy is decreasing.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.320]   Do you know why?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.960]   Because there has been a spike in deaths of despair.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:22.040]   There's more suicides, there's more liver disease,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.680]   which we know comes from alcohol abuse,
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.280]   and there's more deaths from opiate overdoses.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.160]   In this successful, follow your passion-infused world,
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.120]   you don't need a slogan.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.620]   You need a savior.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.880]   Do you know why you need a savior?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.280]   Here's why, Jeremiah chapter 17, verse five.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.760]   This is what it says to you
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.280]   in that little section of Scripture.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.240]   It says, "Thus says the Lord."
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.720]   Theos, God, the one who loves you,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.960]   and he wants to set you free,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.680]   and he's not looking to rip you off.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.920]   This is what he says.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.900]   "Cursed is the man who follows their dreams,
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.960]   "their passions, their heart."
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.160]   We say around here all the time,
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.600]   don't follow your heart, inform your heart.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.000]   "Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.480]   "and what seems right to men."
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.300]   The one who makes man and the best opinions of men
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.480]   his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.400]   The people who don't lean on their own understanding
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.240]   and in all their ways acknowledge him,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.840]   their paths aren't straight.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:35.720]   It says, "For that person will be like,"
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.200]   and haven't this been so many of your experience?
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.320]   Some of you guys that haven't, by the kindness of God,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.480]   learned his ways.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.100]   "The person who trusts in mankind and follows their heart
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.180]   "and doesn't inform their heart with God's gracious word
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.840]   "will be like a bush in the desert
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.480]   "and will not see when prosperity comes.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.680]   "Their sleep won't be sweet, there will be no rest,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.480]   "but they'll live in a stony wasteland in the wilderness,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.400]   "a land of salt without inhabitant."
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.440]   Oh, man.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.120]   But verse seven, "Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.880]   "and whose trust is the Lord."
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.960]   You ever seen people like this?
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.520]   I mean, I mention her to you all the time
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.120]   because just as a guy who was an athlete
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.260]   and who delights in physical activity
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.360]   and competition and all that, I can remember,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.460]   I thought the worst thing that would ever happen to me
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.040]   would be if I was in a wheelchair.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.440]   And about the time I was in my teenage years,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.360]   I bumped into a gal that had just pushed through her.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.840]   She was a great athlete.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.000]   Name's Johnny Erickson-Tata.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I just can't encourage you enough to sit at her feet.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.240]   Johnny, through a freak accident in the ocean,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.360]   severed her spinal cord, has been in a wheelchair now
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.760]   for over five decades.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.080]   But she's not in a stony wasteland.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.040]   It's not in a world filled with salt.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.560]   I mean, she is a tree firmly planted by a tree of water
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.820]   that extends its root, as it says in verse eight,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.560]   by a stream, and she doesn't fear when the heat comes.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.160]   She's not wild about her wheelchair.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.760]   She struggles with the same things you and I struggle with,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.480]   but I'm telling you, man, that life is green
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.780]   and it is beautiful, and I look at her.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.320]   She's not anxious about the things
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.400]   that we're all anxious about.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.680]   There's no year of drought.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.720]   There's no lack of fruit in her life,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.580]   like we're promised in verse eight and nine,
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.760]   because Jesus says, listen, man, you need to know
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.560]   she's not following her passions and her dreams.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   She's not living her best life now.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.520]   She is actually trusting in the only God who's ever lived,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.480]   and because of that, because she's not following
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.280]   her deceitful heart, but she's trusting
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.300]   in a good and kind king.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.940]   There's a beauty to her story.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.800]   I can remember saying to God when I met Johnny,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.460]   I just said, Lord, if you gotta put me in a wheelchair
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.040]   to teach me that you alone are sufficient,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.920]   put me in a wheelchair, but oh, Lord, please.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.520]   This is a prayer I would encourage you to pray,
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.440]   but oh, Lord, please, give me enough humility
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.640]   that I can learn it without having to go that direction.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.080]   Let me live my life in such a way
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.160]   that if I end up in a wheelchair,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.800]   I won't think this is the only way
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.300]   I could've learned that lesson.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.760]   But God, if you're who you say you are,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.460]   take me to the wilderness quickly.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.300]   Give me pain quickly.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.840]   Strip me from everything I would love
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.680]   other than you quickly so I can learn who you are.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   So here's the beautiful thing.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.960]   What a humble person does is a humble person
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.660]   looks up in their strength, right?
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.640]   Don't be the kind of person that the first time
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.520]   you look up is when you're flat on your back
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.360]   because you've been run over
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.920]   by another illicit relationship,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.120]   another moment of stupidity.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.280]   But in your strength, while you're young,
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.560]   look to your God.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.740]   This is what God does.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.040]   He doesn't leave you out there waiting for a slogan.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.780]   He comes in the form of a savior.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.100]   I'll just give you a few things.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.440]   I could go on a list.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   I, one time, I sat down with my kids
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.760]   and I just, every now and then,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.740]   tried to give 'em just some simple things to do
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.440]   throughout their day that if they wanna follow Jesus
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.120]   and learn his ways, that these are some things
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.600]   that they can do, right?
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.320]   So if you will, these were just little, in effect,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.080]   moments that I, as a loving father,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.920]   who learned from my loving father,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.800]   was trying to tell my young sons and daughters,
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.680]   look, this is some things that you can do.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.580]   And when you follow Jesus and don't follow your heart,
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.960]   these are things that will be true of you.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.800]   And this is the life.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.000]   And so, one of the things,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.960]   and I just kinda put 'em together in L, you know, in Ls.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.840]   I just used Ls, like get the L out of you, right?
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.120]   So let's just learn truth
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.280]   by putting the right L in our life.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.800]   The first thing I just told 'em is I just said, man, listen,
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.160]   the reward of humility and the fear of the Lord
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.400]   are true riches, not the riches that Brad Pitt
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.080]   would tell you don't satisfy, honor and life.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.400]   And so just be a learner.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.320]   Look, can I tell you how relevant this book is?
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.800]   2,000 years ago, a brother said this,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.120]   have nothing to do with instant theology,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.760]   with worldly fables, fit only for old women,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.240]   the people who sit around and make Pinterest posts.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   It's in the Greek, believe me, just trust me, it was there.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.000]   But on the other hand, then discipline yourself
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.600]   for the purpose of godliness.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.280]   I mean, it's just the fact that discipline, guys,
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.920]   is the price of freedom.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:43.600]   You have to go to work and discipline yourself.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   The precious possession of a man,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.120]   the Scripture says, is diligence.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.400]   And you gotta be diligent to learn at the foot of truth
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.360]   and the foot of someone wiser than you.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.920]   My kids say this to me all the time, you know,
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.760]   I can remember it.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.640]   I said the same thing when I was their age,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.920]   like, this is stupid, I'll never use this stuff.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   Why are they making me read it?
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.560]   Right, you ever said that?
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.040]   Especially when you were in high school, right?
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.160]   And you just kinda, so we can look back together,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.800]   'cause we're all beyond that.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.360]   And we all said it.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.200]   And you know what I said to them?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.300]   I go, hey, listen to me, look.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.320]   You know what you are gonna use?
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.680]   What you're gonna use is you're gonna learn
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.080]   that all of life isn't easy and life isn't about you.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.800]   You're gonna learn to submit to authority.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.600]   You're gonna learn to have an assignment
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.440]   and perform the assignment with excellence.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.040]   You're gonna learn to discipline yourself
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.720]   to not just play Xbox all night
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.640]   and then cram and hope you get by.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.200]   But no, you're gonna do the work you're supposed to do
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.920]   so you can show yourself as a trustworthy individual.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.160]   And that learning to be faithful and disciplined
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.320]   and to work when you're supposed to work
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.800]   and to play when you're supposed to play,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.280]   it's going to lead to prosperity later in your life.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.000]   So you're absolutely correct.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.360]   You may never, ever use this equation.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.840]   You may never use this trivial fact
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.440]   they're trying to teach you about Texas history.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.240]   But what you're gonna use
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.300]   is what you're forming in your life now,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.520]   which is personal integrity and responsibility and diligence.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.540]   That will set you on the course of greatness and peace.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.000]   Discipline is the price of freedom.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.120]   But let me just tell you something.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.600]   Freedom is the reward of discipline.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.840]   Right?
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.300]   You're free.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.920]   You're not burned and shackled by addiction
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.160]   and depression and despair and regret.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.820]   You're free from those things
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.100]   because you've lived your life with honor
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.440]   that your Father in heaven
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   doesn't just tell you to suck it up and do it,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.600]   but even enables you to do it
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.200]   when you humble yourself before him.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.600]   So learn his ways, I told my kids.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.520]   I would ask him, what have you done today
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.920]   to grow in wisdom and stature?
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.280]   Let me just ask you, what did you do today?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.720]   Jesus grew in wisdom and stature
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.200]   and favor with God and man.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.920]   What did you do today to grow a little bit more versed
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.000]   in true theology?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.200]   I would ask him, what did you learn today about God?
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.800]   What one truth about God were you reminded of in his word
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.980]   or his purposes that you didn't know yesterday?
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.220]   Was there anything you did today?
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.800]   You might go, well, Todd, that's why I'm at the porch.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.720]   Okay, so Tuesday's covered.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.540]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.720]   But what are you gonna do tomorrow?
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.260]   Not wait till next Tuesday.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.200]   That's a bad program.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.120]   Every day you wanna learn more of this God
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.640]   who has your best interests in mind.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.720]   And then I always would tell him,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.840]   what are you gonna do differently today
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.800]   because of what you learned?
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.520]   Okay, that's what I wanna ask you tonight.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.120]   I mean, it's great that you're gonna learn some facts
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.920]   about God and some places you can go in Proverbs 3, 13,
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   you know, down through roughly the end of the chapter,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.960]   but if you're not gonna learn his ways
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.160]   and do something with it and say,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.280]   I'm gonna seek God more than I am riches,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.520]   then it doesn't really help you.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.340]   What are you gonna do with this guy that you've heard?
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.760]   He's not trying to rip you off.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.960]   He's trying to set you free.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.760]   He's not trying to get you to do good work
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.080]   so you can turn in a resume.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.320]   He's trying to show you that he's the good God
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.960]   that wants to provide for you the life you've wanted.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.800]   What have you learned today?
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.520]   Secondly, how have you led?
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.320]   Right, I mean, I just would ask my kid,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.620]   how is this world or others better today
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.880]   because you've stepped up?
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.320]   And if you follow Jesus, by the way,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.680]   you're gonna be a learner.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.040]   Jesus calls us to be his disciples.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.520]   The word disciple literally means learner.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.060]   And so don't follow your heart, follow Jesus.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.120]   Jesus says this, follow me.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.240]   It's one of his most off-spoken words.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.260]   Follow me, be a disciple, learn my ways,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.440]   and it will be pleasant to you.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.280]   For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.120]   Man, are you heavy?
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.100]   Are you burdened?
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.420]   I mean, are you burdened and lacking peace?
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.760]   It's probably because your program, your dreams,
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.680]   your heart, you're not informing it,
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.600]   you're following it and you're laying in bed,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.880]   I'm about to be exposed, I might be pregnant.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.600]   I might not get a date.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.720]   I might not make enough money.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:01.080]   You know, you'll never have to say,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.860]   God might not love me enough.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.700]   Man, don't put that on him.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.040]   Listen to what he's saying.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.360]   Let somebody explain to you how much he really does love you.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.560]   (sighs)
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.440]   So follow Jesus.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.320]   When you follow Jesus, you're gonna be a leader of men.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.960]   You're gonna be a leader of women.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.160]   You're gonna learn that great leaders are great servants.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   And so I just ask my kid, man,
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.080]   have you been a servant today?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.480]   When you showed up, how was evil restrained
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.620]   because you were there?
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.800]   Right, how was some girl not exploited
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   'cause you were at that party
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.320]   when you started to drink so much
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.800]   and you saw the predators, you go, uh-uh, no,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.220]   not on my watch, not this girl, not tonight.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:50.980]   How was injustice conquered?
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.920]   How was love multiplied because you were there?
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.560]   How were captives rescued?
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.040]   How was joy increased?
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.300]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.080]   Wouldn't it be awesome if when you were at the party,
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.540]   women go, I'm gonna be safe tonight.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.120]   It's not a license for them to be foolish and drunk
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.240]   'cause you'll drive 'em home,
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.060]   but there's a guy here that isn't gonna look
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.080]   to exploit me.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.600]   Wouldn't it be awesome if your friends
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.800]   who would just go, hey man, you know what?
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.880]   You make everything we do better.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.640]   Not more riotous fun, maybe.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.060]   But man, you know what?
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.520]   I never have regrets the morning
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.080]   after I'm hanging out with you.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   Proverbs 29, two says, when the righteous increase,
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.220]   the people rejoice.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.180]   But when a wicked man rules, people groan.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.580]   I've got a friend, Lee Strobel,
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.040]   who used to be the legal editor for the Chicago Tribune.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.120]   He's written a bunch of books called
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.160]   The Case for Christ, The Case for Easter,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.760]   The Case for Creation, and he's just a brilliant
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.480]   legal mind who was an atheist.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.220]   And while he was working for the Chicago Tribune,
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.560]   he was an alcoholic, he was a rager.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.940]   His wife actually had come to faith, but Lee hadn't yet.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.400]   And he said, I used to come home and my little girl
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.760]   would be sitting there on the floor of the living room
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.560]   when I would come home, and she'd be playing
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.840]   with her toys, and he said, I'd come home,
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.560]   and she'd look up and she'd go, hi, Daddy.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.760]   And she would always gather her toys
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.280]   and get up and go in her room.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.960]   And he used to think that she was respectful
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.720]   of my hard day of work, but no, she knew
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.480]   that peace was no longer in the home when Dad walked in.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.840]   And he realized people didn't rejoice when he showed up.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   It was like there's a predator here.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   That's not what a daddy wants.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.920]   I can tell you by the kindness of God, I can remember.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.840]   There was a day that I had kind of let my kids,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.920]   like we try and regulate when they can just dive in
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.680]   on certain stuff, the young mind is informed.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.200]   Justin Bieber endorses that.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   And so we just don't let them, just kind of a carte blanche
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.080]   on video games and things like that,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.680]   when they were younger, and Xbox stuff.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.560]   But one day we just said, man, you can go after it, right?
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.400]   Just go play.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.680]   So they were playing for like an hour and a half,
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.240]   and I got home because they had done well through a week
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.560]   and they had performed well in discipline
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.880]   so they had some freedom.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.680]   But I can remember, I got home and I walked in the door
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.200]   and I can remember that I could hear them up there
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.840]   playing Madden, and they were talking.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.120]   At the time, my youngest was nine.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   And he was playing with his brothers,
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.840]   and they were going, oh no, I can't believe it!
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.160]   And the nine-year-old heard me.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.440]   He goes, time out, time out, time out, no, stop, stop, stop!
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.160]   Time out, time out, time out!
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.000]   And they go, what, what?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.480]   He goes, just time out, hit time out!
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   And then I heard his little feet
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.880]   run across the upstairs room, come down the back steps,
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.520]   open the door, and run to me and go, Daddy!
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.440]   And give me a hug.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.160]   I said, I'm so glad you're home.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.080]   And I just looked at him and I realized he just left Madden.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.000]   At an intense moment,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.060]   just because he was so glad I was home.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.000]   And I thought about my friend Lee, and I just go, man,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.100]   that's what happens when you follow Jesus.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.920]   And you're a dad that's other-centered,
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   and you bring a blessing into the home and not a curse.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.040]   And I gave him a hug and I said, man, go win your game!
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.480]   And he ran up the steps.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.680]   His two dumb teenage brothers just sat up there
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.480]   and go, you're back, all right, here we go, right?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.840]   But now those brothers have pushed through those years,
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.040]   you know, and they're the same way.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.680]   We have an amazing relationship.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:32.260]   You know, I just, when you follow Jesus, not your heart,
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.160]   and you learn his ways, man, you can lead,
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.800]   and when you lead, you lead in a way it's a blessing.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.320]   And I just ask my kids, love, man, how'd you do today?
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.240]   'Cause when you follow your heart,
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.880]   you follow lustful thoughts, right?
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.200]   It's desperately sick and it's evil above all else.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.720]   But what have you done today to make someone else know
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.160]   of God's great love for them?
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:56.360]   What have you done so that somebody out there
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.840]   who maybe was at the end
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.500]   of believing that their life mattered,
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.340]   they know that there's a God that cares for them
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.900]   because you cared for them in Jesus' name.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.240]   One of the things I would do with my kids a lot,
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.160]   you know, grocery stores or something at times,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.880]   I would just, you know, let, and see people behind me.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.160]   We had more than they did sometimes.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.120]   I'd say, hey, but just put this stuff,
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.400]   in fact, put this stuff ahead of mine, right?
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.560]   And they'd check it out, check it out.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.440]   I'd go, hey, just bag that.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   And I'd just go, and they'd go, you know.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.080]   I can remember one time we were at Target around Christmas,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.800]   and I just looked at what appeared to me to be a person
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.920]   who didn't have the provision, you know, that we had.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.040]   And I was, you know, in line.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   I watched the way the mom was saying,
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.720]   no, we can't get that, no, we can't get that.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.200]   And I just said, hey, let them go in front of me.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.160]   She goes, oh, thank you so much,
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.840]   'cause she had a bunch of kids that were kind of crazy.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.160]   And I go, and by the way, put that back on the thing.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.760]   And I let them get in front of me,
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.720]   and I let them check out,
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.280]   and the mom was kind of digging through her cash.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.880]   And I just go, hey, this is gonna be part of ours tonight.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.720]   Bless you.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.260]   And she looked at me, and she was like, what are you doing?
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.200]   This is a great story,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.680]   because it was one of the most encouraging things
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.240]   of my life, and I just said, well, look,
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.840]   I pray, and I use this line a lot.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.700]   I pray this small act of kindness, and it's small,
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.860]   just reminds you of God's great love for you.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.000]   It happened to be around the Christmas season, you know?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.420]   And she goes, man, how could I thank you?
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.260]   I go, well, you know what?
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.500]   You don't have to do anything to thank me.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.880]   I just want, maybe just realize that what I'm doing,
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.680]   it's just a reminder that God loves you,
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.520]   that I haven't forgotten about you.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   I mean, that's what Christmas is all about.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.600]   I mean, if you really wanna do something,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.820]   I would love for you to come and celebrate
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.040]   who my Jesus is this Christmas.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.000]   Would you please consider maybe just coming
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.960]   and hanging out with your kids,
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.360]   and being at Christmas Eve service?
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.120]   She goes, oh, I can't do that.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.240]   And I just said to her, I go, I get it.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.080]   And she goes, no, I can't do that.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.160]   I would really like to.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.480]   She goes, but there was somebody else
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.680]   that was just so kind to me, and I promised them,
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.440]   I promised them that I would go to church with them.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.200]   And I go, I go, that's amazing.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.040]   Well, go to church.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.880]   What church did she invite you to?
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.720]   She goes, it's a church called like Water something,
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.880]   Water, kid goes, Watermark.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.160]   She goes, we're gonna go to Watermark.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.860]   I go, oh, definitely, you should do that.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.660]   And I just thought to myself,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.380]   how great is it that I'm out there with other folks
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.420]   that are following Jesus and just loving it,
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.420]   and done something to her that made her,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.100]   for a second, realize maybe life is worth
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.800]   having a little bit of hope in it.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.140]   Amen.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.860]   You know how often you can do that?
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.340]   Maybe this, I just say to people all the time,
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.900]   maybe this small act of kindness,
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.100]   just remind you of God's great love for you.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.700]   Don't follow your stinking heart, right?
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.420]   I mean, can you imagine a guy, and he's with a girl,
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.660]   it's Netflix and chill time,
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.660]   and before he chills, he looks at her,
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.580]   and he gets up and go, we gotta chill.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.220]   And maybe this great act of discipline
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.980]   can be a reminder of God's great love for you,
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.740]   'cause you're his daughter and you're precious,
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.980]   and I love you and I respect you.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.060]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:08.040]   That made me like the guy, all right?
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.500]   Love.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.940]   I got so many of them here, man.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:16.780]   I'm not gonna give them all to you,
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.380]   I'll just give you one more.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.300]   You know what I do with my kids?
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.020]   One of the things I did, I'll give you two more,
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.580]   but one was just, what the L, right?
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.180]   Here we go, so it's laugh.
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.820]   I just, I said to my kids, have you laughed out loud today?
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.980]   Have you laughed uncontrollably?
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.940]   Have you laughed 'til you cried?
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.900]   Have you made others laugh much today?
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.660]   Proverbs 17, 22 says a joyful heart is good medicine.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.820]   Man, we're not uptight, you know,
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.500]   we're not pilgrims and Puritans,
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.860]   and by the way, before you throw them under the bus,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   go look at their life.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.480]   Man, there was some amazing richness of life
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.300]   back when those people lived a good life,
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.520]   but a broken spirit is what dries up the bones.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.900]   I mean, we gotta learn to laugh.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.140]   A joyful heart is good medicine.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.780]   My family, we laughed together a ton.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.860]   We played games, we compete.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.220]   I mean, I'll tell you a quick story
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.340]   of just like stuff we would do,
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.300]   like with our kids, our kids just watch us have fun.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.900]   We play games and there's consequences.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.380]   I can remember one Thanksgiving,
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.960]   we were playing a game and the loser,
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.300]   my neighbor's next door that we'd just started
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.700]   to build a good relationship with,
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.020]   they actually built a pool and it was in the fall,
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.820]   and so it got to November and the pool was done,
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.520]   so Thanksgiving weekend was the big opening
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.620]   of their pool in their backyard.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.660]   And it's Thanksgiving night, we're playing games,
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.300]   and so we played a game and the loser,
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.260]   the consequence was you had to go over to their house,
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.660]   it was almost 10 o'clock at night,
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.220]   and knock on the door, okay?
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.380]   And then when they answered,
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.640]   because we knew they were up,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.940]   and when they answered, we just said,
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.140]   "Hey," whoever lost had to say,
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.320]   "What's the pool record?"
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.380]   Well, they'd just opened the pool
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.300]   and that's just a stupid question anyway.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.140]   What's the pool record?
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:48.980]   And then we just said,
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:49.820]   "Well, what do you mean the pool record?"
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.620]   He goes, "Listen, I used to swim in high school."
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.580]   None of my kids swam in high school, none of us did.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.660]   But you had to say, "I used to swim in a high school
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.340]   "and I would like to set the pool record."
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.900]   Which is just nuts, 10 o'clock at Thanksgiving night.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.180]   But this guy, this buddy goes, "Oh, okay."
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.140]   And so anyway, what you had to do is go out to the pool,
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.220]   you had to get there next to the pool
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.140]   and kind of do the Michael Phelps,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.780]   you know, kind of thing like this.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.980]   Then you had to dive in and you had to swim
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.060]   as absolutely poorly as you could,
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.780]   you know, like just kind of flailing your arms
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.180]   after three, (grunts)
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.340]   just like this, touch the other side,
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.180]   go, (grunts)
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.820]   and then just come back and do the exact same thing.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.460]   It wasn't a very big pool.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.380]   And get to the other side,
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.500]   and when you got to the other side,
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.580]   touch it and just kind of go,
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.220]   "What was my time, what was my time?"
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.380]   And no matter what they said, you had to go, "Yes!"
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.300]   And then get out and walk out of their backyard
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.140]   and not say a word.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.740]   That was the stakes.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.620]   And my wife lost.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.060]   And we were all upstairs, my kids and I,
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.860]   we're looking out the back window and it was hilarious.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.620]   And my wife kind of came back in the house,
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.780]   dripping wet, like, "I am not doing that."
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.820]   But we laughed with our neighbors the next day,
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.180]   go, "Hey, what was that last night?"
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:05.460]   Besides the turkey, what else was going on over there?
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.340]   But we just do that kind of crazy stuff,
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.180]   and we laugh about that.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.340]   It's one of the favorite memories
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.820]   that we have as neighbors together.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.980]   Silly, crazy stuff, we just laugh.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.940]   We have a little, a joyful heart is good medicine.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.780]   Man, who'd you bring joy to today?
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.980]   Do you remember the last time you laughed till you cried?
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.100]   The last time I laughed till I cried was today,
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.700]   in our staff meeting.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.780]   And I don't have time to explain it to you,
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.940]   but it was amazing.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.580]   It was amazing, all right.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:37.540]   Last one.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.740]   When you follow Jesus, man, you lean on others.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:42.980]   You don't go at it alone.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.940]   And so I'd ask my kids, man,
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.420]   who are you relying to spur you on?
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.780]   You're not a lone ranger.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.940]   Who are the friends in your life,
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.380]   'cause Jesus wants you, right, to not be at this alone.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.140]   Wise men seek solitude.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.980]   Wise men learn.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.300]   Wise men sit at the feet of Jesus, but fools isolate.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.940]   Fools isolate.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.580]   Wise men and women will walk out of here tonight
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.820]   and go to open group and start to assimilate
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.260]   and get grafted in with other Christ followers,
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.260]   not heart followers.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.700]   And those friends will encourage them and sharpen them
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.980]   and love them.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.340]   And shepherd them.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.220]   I'd ask my kids, man, who's got access to your heart?
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.580]   Who's informing your heart?
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.860]   Are they truth tellers?
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.700]   Are they Christ followers?
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.180]   Who faithfully reproves you?
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.900]   Who admonishes you when you're unruly?
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.220]   When's the last time you repented and changed
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.100]   because someone who loved you told you the truth?
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.860]   See, Christ followers have that.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.140]   I've got friends that sit with me and just go,
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.820]   Todd, this is an area that you can strengthen.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.860]   How great is that?
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.340]   How great is that?
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.180]   Guys, you don't need a slogan.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.140]   I need a savior.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.820]   You don't need insta-theology 'cause you got real theology.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.900]   Don't be around it like some people
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.020]   and have to learn it through experience.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.600]   Drink deeply of the kindness of God.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.340]   I'll just close by reading Scripture.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.420]   It's in Colossians 3, and I gotta tell you,
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.060]   this is what happens when you follow Jesus.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.500]   You can really look forward to something.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.980]   You don't have dread.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.540]   So in Colossians 3, it says,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.900]   "Therefore, if you've been raised up with Christ,"
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.620]   I'm just gonna quote it, just the idea that
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:32.980]   if you are identifying that sin is wicked
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.060]   and is an offense to God because he loves people
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.620]   and sin hurts people, you just,
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.380]   I've been crucified with Christ,
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.500]   the life which I live in the flesh,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.900]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.540]   so the resurrection power of Christ is at work in me.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.900]   He says, if that's who you are,
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.540]   if you're a Christian, then quit following your heart.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.380]   Inform your heart.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.860]   Your heart is desperately sick and deceitful above all else.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.700]   Don't be surprised.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.980]   Don't beat yourself up.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.420]   Temptation isn't sin.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:00.620]   Not following the God of creation is sin.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.660]   So keep seeking the things above where Christ is.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.220]   He's seated at the right hand of God.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.420]   Set your mind on the things above,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.900]   not on the things that are of the earth,
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.460]   the worldly fables, the insta-theology.
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.460]   Set your mind on God, good theology.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.300]   Watch this.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.460]   For you have died, which means not really,
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.900]   but you've died to yourself.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.000]   I know my heart is sick.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.700]   I don't wanna be in a land of salt.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.600]   I wanna be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.660]   And so watch this.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.500]   This is what you've got to look forward to in verse four.
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.740]   When Christ, if you follow him,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.300]   you can look forward, there's an L for you,
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.540]   you can look forward to this.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.660]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.740]   in other words, the day is coming
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.780]   when the clouds will be rolled back like a scroll
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.220]   and your king is gonna reveal himself,
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.020]   that this wasn't just a wisp of an idea,
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.040]   this is truth anchored in history.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.780]   When Christ, who is your life, is revealed,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.500]   then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.980]   And the world's gonna go, how did you know?
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.220]   How did you know he was the one worth serving?
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.820]   And by the way, so it worked out well for you then,
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.160]   it's gonna work out well for you now.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.000]   And so watch this.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.380]   You're not gonna fall insta-theology.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.940]   And so verse five, therefore,
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.160]   since you know that God is there and you know he's good,
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.000]   you know there's gonna be a day
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.460]   when he's gonna wrap this thing up,
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.460]   consider the members of your earthly body
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.120]   not as worth a following.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.180]   Don't just be dead to that insta-pull towards immorality,
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.260]   to that insta-pull to impurity.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.660]   Don't follow your passions, you're dead to it.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.760]   Don't follow evil desires and greed.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.000]   It amassed to idolatry.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.380]   Listen to Brad Pitt, listen to Justin Bieber,
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.600]   listen to Jesus.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.900]   Father, I thank you that you love us
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.820]   and we don't have to scroll through Instagram
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.700]   or Pinterest hoping we find a slogan.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.300]   We've got a savior.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.180]   He is kind and he is good and he is right and he is true
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.700]   and he cares for us and his name is Jesus.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.660]   And we don't have to wonder if he loves us.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.860]   He's shown us he loves us.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.660]   We don't have to try and make it up.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:04.260]   We just gotta make up our minds,
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.420]   not be conformed to the world,
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.700]   but be transformed by the renewing of our mind
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.660]   that we might get to experience, prove out with our life
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.080]   what is good and acceptable and perfect and life-giving.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.700]   And so I just pray for my friends that tonight
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.980]   they go home having just learned
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.260]   and being reminded of these things
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.000]   and they would execute on it.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.260]   And they would start to be people
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.620]   who learn more of your ways
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.860]   and who lead as a result of that.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.860]   And who love, whose life brings laughter and joy to others,
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:42.180]   who lean on other people and who look forward to the day.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.100]   When you come and you come quickly,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.140]   you rendered a man according to their deeds.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.500]   Thank you, Father, that even now
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.180]   our deeds can lead to sweep, sweep.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.160]   It can lead to forgiveness if we'll just trust you.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.740]   But having been forgiven, let us not follow our heart.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.700]   Let us inform it.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.200]   In Jesus' name, amen.
