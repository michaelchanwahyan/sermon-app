[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:34.700]   - All right, let's go, let's do this.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.540]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.380]   My name's JD.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.580]   A quick shout out to our Porch Live locations
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.620]   with us every week.
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340]   Y'all help me welcome them strong from Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340]   We've got Porch Live Midland, Texas,
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.140]   Porch Live Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.620]   and Porch Live Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.400]   Say hello from Dallas, Texas, everyone.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.240]   Welcome 'em.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.100]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.820]   Of course, my friends in the room,
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.100]   so glad that you are joining us on your Tuesday night.
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.980]   We are heading into night three of a series called POV,
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.960]   where we are looking at stories of Jesus in the Gospels
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.940]   from Bible characters' points of view.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.800]   We covered the disciples week one
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.140]   and seeing different miracles.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.420]   We covered Zacchaeus last week.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.740]   And before we get to tonight's character
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.220]   and his point of view,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.140]   I wanna tell you about a point of view of mine.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.100]   I'm gonna go ahead and let you in.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.840]   This might be the most vulnerable thing
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.020]   I've ever said from stage.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.260]   This is a guilty pleasure,
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.640]   and I wanna go ahead and just give a few disclaimers.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.980]   One, I know that a lot of you men specifically
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.420]   are gonna wanna take my man card
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.320]   after what I'm about to say.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.300]   I understand that this might resonate
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.780]   with more of the female audience,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.620]   which I'm okay with.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.700]   Someone has to go first.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100]   And I know that there are more men out there
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.000]   who are silent, and this is your opportunity
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.780]   to be able to say me too.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.480]   I also wanna go ahead and say that since my college days,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.460]   I have gotten a little more sanctified and like Christ,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.500]   and so please save your DMs, your emails.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740]   I know this is not a Christian television show.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.140]   But a guilty pleasure of mine is I kind of like
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.340]   anything with the plot line involving vampires
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.540]   and werewolves.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.940]   And so, I know.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.460]   And like Twilight, I was in it.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.300]   I went.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.460]   But even worse, even worse, there's a show on Netflix,
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.800]   and I hate that it has this word in it,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.900]   but Vampire Diaries.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.420]   It's just, the high pitch of that scream
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.780]   is what I'm talking about.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.680]   It's a problem.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280]   But Team Damon, Salvatore all the way.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   Anyways, so I'll get to why that's relevant,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   'cause right now it's not really relevant.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.240]   But flashback to college, I get asked to go
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.420]   spend my spring break in LA.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.320]   And we are there in SoCal visiting a friend who went to USC.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.480]   And while we're there, he's like,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.680]   "Hey, I wanna hang out with a few of my friends.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.800]   "Have y'all meet and connect."
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   I'm like, "That would be awesome."
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.340]   And so I go just another day in LA in my mind,
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.280]   and I meet this guy, and he was just cool from the get-go.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.640]   He had this like sick beard,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.080]   he had this like sweet Australian accent, cool outfit.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.200]   And I was like, "This guy's cool."
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.900]   And I remember we did a lot of stuff that day.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.680]   We went out to eat, went to church,
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.200]   I think we hit up an amusement park.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.640]   I can't remember all we did,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.280]   but we were bros by the end of the day, that's for sure.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.740]   And so I did what bros do.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.460]   I went and hit him up on IG after and go to find him.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.200]   And his name was Nathan.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.000]   And so I type in Nathan,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   and I ended up finding him through the mutual friends.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.400]   So we can follow for follow, like for like, all that stuff.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   And my eyes, I mean, when I saw what I saw
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.480]   in the bio of Nathan's Instagram,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   it said, "Cole Michelson from the Vampire Diaries."
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.360]   And I was like, "No way, this is the wrong guy."
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.040]   And I started doing some research,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.260]   and I had just spent the whole day
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.720]   with one of the main characters from the Vampire Diaries.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.520]   And I was like, "What in the world?"
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   He had millions of followers.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.520]   And I was like, "I have watched all six seasons twice.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.480]   "Like, how did I miss this?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.120]   "What's going on?"
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   And what I realized is I was not as much of a fan
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.080]   as I thought I was.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.440]   I was low key a fake fan.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.360]   But actually, the real problem was,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.300]   is I knew Cole Michelson, you know,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.040]   with the fangs like biting into people all the time,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.420]   but I didn't know Nathan.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.460]   I didn't know Nathan.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.100]   But this whole time, someone I claimed to be a fan of,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.440]   I didn't even know that he was standing
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.100]   right in front of me.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.640]   And I start there because tonight we're talking about
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.600]   why you can't see Jesus clearly in your life.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   And I think a lot of times,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   because we are simply mere fans of Jesus,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.960]   or we just see him from a narrative point of view,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.840]   or we just see him as another Bible character,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.480]   or a good thing and not the thing,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.000]   so many times in life, he is right in front of us
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.900]   and we miss it.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.460]   So many people get to the end of their life.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.600]   When everything comes to a head,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.200]   they chase all that the world says has to offer,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.900]   and they missed it.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.460]   Because Jesus was right there every Tuesday night,
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.480]   making himself available, and they didn't even know it.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.320]   Why?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.300]   Because they were a fan of Jesus,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.760]   but they didn't know the real Jesus.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.280]   And so tonight, I wanna make sure that we know,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.560]   that we know, that we know who Jesus really is.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.280]   Because this may be how you view Jesus.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.880]   It is the most important thing about you.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.480]   Where you go when you fail and make mistakes
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.780]   has a lot to do with your view of Jesus.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.900]   Your idea of success has a lot to do
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.740]   with your view of Jesus.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.100]   A.W. Tozer, in his book, "Knowledge of the Holy,"
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.820]   if you have not read it, it's a little heady.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.940]   I'm not a big intellectual guy, but I loved this book.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.500]   I highly recommend, write it down, get it.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.340]   "Knowledge of the Holy."
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.500]   The first thing he says is,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.060]   "What a man or woman thinks of when he hears the word God
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.540]   "may be the most important thing about him."
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.380]   And it's true.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.440]   And I don't want us to spend every Tuesday night
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.020]   and every day with Jesus offering himself,
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.100]   fully available right in front of us,
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.780]   and we get to the end of our life and we miss it.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.580]   And so we're gonna look at a point of view tonight
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.260]   from a blind man named Bartimaeus.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.460]   And you might be thinking like me,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.900]   so wait, we're gonna talk about a point of view
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.660]   from a blind man.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.740]   That makes zero sense.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.560]   Like, what did he see?
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.760]   Nothing, he had no view.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.200]   And that's true, but it's also not.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.100]   Because what we're gonna see in this story
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.380]   is this blind man saw Jesus more clearly
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.420]   than any other person around.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.900]   And we're gonna look at his example
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.520]   of what it means to see Jesus clearly.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.140]   So if you would, if you have your Bible,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.020]   open up with me Mark chapter 10, verse 46.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.720]   Mark chapter 10, verse 46.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.060]   If you don't have your Bible,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.820]   you can read on the screens with me.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.200]   And they came to Jericho,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.120]   and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.740]   in a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar,
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.460]   the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.200]   And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.680]   he began to cry out and say,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.000]   "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960]   But he cried out all the more,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   "Son of David, have mercy on me."
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.160]   And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.280]   And they called the blind man, saying to him,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.640]   "Take heart, get up, he is calling you."
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.160]   And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.460]   And Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.620]   And the blind man said to him,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.580]   "Rabbi, let me recover my sight."
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.920]   And Jesus said to him, "Go your way,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.520]   "your faith has made you well."
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.820]   And immediately, he recovered his sight
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.160]   and followed him on the way.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.340]   We're gonna look at this story,
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.660]   the blind beggar, Bartimaeus,
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.620]   and we're gonna learn things that keep us
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.260]   from seeing Jesus clearly.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.840]   Things that keep us from seeing Jesus clearly.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.920]   And just right off the bat,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.080]   the first thing I wanna point out
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.960]   is something that prohibits you from seeing Jesus clearly
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   is that you see Jesus simply as a man rather than Lord.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:58.200]   You see Jesus simply as a man rather than Lord.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   Here's how we see that.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   I want you to look at the differences in the two responses.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.820]   This story's actually recorded out of the four gospels,
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.140]   which is just four different vantage points
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.840]   or point of views, you could say,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.760]   of Jesus's life on earth.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.500]   I want you to look how Luke articulates this moment
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.280]   in chapter 18, verse 35.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.640]   So this is just a different angle on this exact story.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.440]   He says, "As he drew near to Jericho,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.840]   "a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.900]   "and hearing a crowd going by,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.480]   "he inquired what he meant,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.500]   "and they told him, 'Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.'
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.860]   "And he cried out, 'Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.'
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.520]   "So Bartimaeus is on the side of the road,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.640]   "he can't see anything, but he hears like
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.840]   "what sounds like just a stampede of elephants going by,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.980]   "everyone's cheering, and he's like, 'Yo, what's going on?'
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.020]   "And they're like, 'Hey, it's Jesus of Nazareth.'
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.140]   "But then he doesn't say, 'Jesus of Nazareth,'
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.320]   "he says, 'Jesus, son of David.'
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.400]   "And right there, we should see a contrast
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.100]   "in two different descriptions of Jesus.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.060]   "One, the crowd saw him as another man,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.320]   "but Bartimaeus saw him as the son of David."
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.880]   We'll get to Bartimaeus in a second.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   I wanna focus in on what it means
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.320]   by the crowd calling him Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.920]   Today, if I were to introduce myself, I'd say,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.400]   "Hey, I'm JD, and the first thing we do as humans
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.020]   "in meeting someone, we wanna kinda get to know
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.880]   "like who is this person, what can I find out about them?"
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.920]   And we start to put things, attach them,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   and we do that by asking two questions right off the bat.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.300]   Number one, what do you do?
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.280]   And number two, y'all know it, where are you from?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   This is the equivalent of that in this culture in the Bible.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.820]   People would say name, and then where they're from,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.680]   that way it gives an association culturally and socially
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.760]   and all these different things.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.080]   It attaches something to their name.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.400]   And so when they say Jesus from Nazareth,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.880]   they are not saying something good
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.860]   or something worthy to be praised.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.100]   They're actually doing the opposite.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.520]   How do I know that?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.760]   When Jesus first enters into his ministry in John chapter one,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.560]   one of the first thing he starts to do is call his disciples.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   They were young adults like you and I.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.400]   And he's calling these guys, and you have to know,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.380]   at this time, Jews, they were underneath Roman captivity,
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.360]   and they are awaiting the day of the promised Messiah,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.240]   the King of the Jews, who's gonna come and conquer Rome,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.360]   and then the Jews are gonna rise to the top
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.560]   because of their King, the Messiah.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.480]   That's what they're waiting on.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.600]   They think he's gonna be of political, just high value.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.960]   They think he's gonna look like a king
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.360]   and all the things that come with the king
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.620]   and all the royalty.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.760]   That's what he's gonna look like,
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.720]   and he's gonna come from that kind of descent.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   So they said, okay, we're looking for Jesus,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.960]   but then whenever he calls Philip,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.480]   he tells Philip to come and follow him
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.760]   and go and get Nathanael.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.900]   And I want you to look at this interaction
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.800]   in John chapter one.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.400]   So Philip meets Jesus,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.880]   then Jesus sends him to go get Nathanael,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.360]   and Philip says this.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.040]   "Philip found Nathanael and said to him,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.000]   "we have found him of whom Moses and the law
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.540]   "and also the prophets wrote,
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.020]   "Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.820]   "And Nathanael said to him,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.780]   "can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.500]   "That should show you what people thought
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.080]   "when you heard Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.400]   This guy isn't nobody.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.200]   I think about me,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.840]   it takes me a long time when people ask where I'm from
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   because of where I'm from to say where I'm actually from.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   If people are not from Texas,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.000]   I'll say, oh, I'm from Texas.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   And they always wanna know,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.500]   I'm like, people are so nosy these days.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.400]   They're like, what part of Texas?
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.840]   And I'm like, Dallas.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.800]   And I'm two hours east of Dallas.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.760]   They're like, okay, well, what part of Dallas?
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.220]   And I'm like, okay, well, I don't wanna lie.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.640]   So I'm actually in East Texas, small town.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   Like, oh, which one?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.840]   I know, I have some relatives in East Texas.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.920]   I'm like, here we go.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.080]   So I say, Longview, Texas.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.960]   And then, okay, Longview represents.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.360]   The thing is, they're like, oh, nice.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Do you know so-and-so?
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.480]   And then I have to say again,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.700]   okay, I'm not actually from Longview.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.520]   So it's like, Texas, Dallas, Longview.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.840]   And then I'm like, and I'm right here.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.960]   And it's called Union Grove, as some call it.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.800]   No.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.760]   No, no, no.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.680]   When you drive into my hometown,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.320]   it says Union Grove, population 461.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.640]   We have one yellow blinking light.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.940]   We have one gas station.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.520]   We do not have a grocery store.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.640]   I would ride my four-wheeler or my horse
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   to the gas station to get milk.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.480]   I'm not kidding.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.760]   People would ride horses to school.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.540]   At my high school graduation, 42 of us were present.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.320]   That's like 10th of the population of Union Grove.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.380]   And numerous of them were with child.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.920]   I was one of like two or three to go to college.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.960]   I was, you just don't get out of Union Grove,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.440]   which that's nothing on Union Grove.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   That's just the reality of where I'm from.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.180]   And so today when people see me covered in tattoos
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.780]   and in Dallas and all these different things,
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.940]   they're like, where are you from?
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.380]   And I'm like, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.160]   And the reason why is 'cause I don't want people to know
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.020]   my upbringing looks like you could kill a hog
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.380]   on a Tuesday morning and eat it for dinner on Tuesday night.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.700]   Like that's how I was raised.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.100]   I mean, talk about farm to table.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.580]   I'm not kidding.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.820]   And so it just takes me all this time
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.520]   because I know the moment that people learn where I'm from,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.360]   they will associate something to it.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.220]   The problem is, is I'm JD.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.660]   We're talking about Jesus Christ.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.260]   And so when you simply see him as another man,
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.720]   you found yourself not seeing him clearly.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.700]   If you see him just simply as Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.300]   and I don't know what that looks like in 2022 for you.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.400]   Some of you see him as Jesus calling my little Devo partner
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.180]   that I give him five minutes a morning with.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.360]   Jesus, the guy who hangs on my Catholic grandma's portrait
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.200]   with blonde hair, blue eyes, petting a lamb.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.380]   Or Jesus, the one that I hear about
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.480]   when I come in for Christmas and Easter.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.760]   Jesus, the one that I grew up in a childhood Christian home
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.300]   hearing about, you know, yeah, Jesus, another guy,
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.600]   a good guy, the man upstairs, a good thing.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.880]   That's what you think.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.540]   I don't know what for you Jesus looks like,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.000]   but if it's just simply Jesus, the Nazareth,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   Jesus, the man who allows bad things to happen in the world.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:34.620]   Jesus, the one who must've allowed my parents divorce
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.380]   or Jesus, the one who wasn't there
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.220]   like people said he would be.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.740]   Jesus, the one that the church that they claim to love,
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.580]   but they hurt me so deeply.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.440]   If you let experiences or anything
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.760]   other than God's word dictate who Jesus is to you,
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.800]   you don't have a clear view of Jesus.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.480]   And we see here that these people
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.920]   simply calling him Jesus from Nazareth
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.820]   shows that they don't really know who he is.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.380]   They see him as just another man, a good thing.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.440]   And therefore they were okay with Jesus
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.660]   just simply walking by.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.460]   But who had a different response?
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.240]   The blind man, the man that couldn't see
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.800]   but simply heard the name Jesus.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.280]   We see such an act of faith that he clearly saw
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.600]   with his spiritual eyes, with his heart,
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.520]   and he understood and he professed by faith,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.320]   oh, Jesus is here, I'm shooting my shot.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.880]   Jesus, son of David.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.960]   You ought to understand that at this time,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.620]   this man was taking a huge chance
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.160]   by acknowledging Jesus as the son of David.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.400]   He's using what's called messianic language,
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.140]   which means that he is just professing to the Jews
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.380]   that Jesus was the coming Messiah.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.760]   Which again, though, at the time,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.540]   this is a really twisted and upside down way of thinking
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.540]   because nothing good comes from Nazareth.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.720]   So how could Jesus from Nazareth be Jesus,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.020]   the son of David and Abraham
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.220]   in the lineage of the fathers of our people?
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.720]   There's no way this is him,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.800]   but this man, although he didn't see, he believed.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.260]   And he said, Jesus, son of David.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.400]   And we see, although he couldn't see,
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.900]   he saw Jesus and understood who he was
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.000]   more than anyone else around.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.440]   By this proclamation of acknowledging Jesus
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.640]   as the son of David,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.080]   what he is saying is Jesus,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.820]   he's not even just the son of David.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.780]   This is the son of God.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:55.600]   The God is standing before me.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   And so my response is to cry out for mercy,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.700]   to cry out for his name.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.580]   He knew he had a proper response
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.700]   because he had a right, clear view of who Jesus was.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.840]   His actions, he's saying to these people around,
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.040]   no, no, no, no.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.920]   This isn't just Jesus from Nazareth.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.480]   This is Jesus from the beginning.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.720]   Colossians 1:17 tells us when it's talking about
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.860]   who Jesus is as he is fully God and fully man,
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.520]   it says that he was from and before the beginning
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.060]   and by him, Jesus, and through him, Jesus,
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.540]   all things hold together since the beginning.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.600]   Before there was a beginning of time, Jesus was.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.500]   So just to diminish his name
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.740]   by simply calling him Jesus of Nazareth
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.380]   or Jesus the good guy,
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.180]   Jesus, just another man, another religion,
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.780]   is to diminish who he is
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.480]   because right before us, you guys need to understand,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.080]   this is Jesus, son of the living God.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.620]   Therefore, our response should be to shout,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.160]   to beg him for mercy.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.100]   But this was the only man, the blind man,
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.400]   who had a proper view of Jesus.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.000]   Sometimes I come into this place
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.840]   and I see our response.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   We're singing.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.580]   We're supposed to be singing to Jesus,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.580]   the son of the living God,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.080]   the king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.520]   And I look around
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.680]   and I see people who are clearly not seeing him correctly.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.320]   Because I want you to imagine,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.000]   when we worship, if we sing,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.960]   what if he was standing in the flesh right here
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.660]   and you could truly see him?
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.400]   How would you worship differently?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.500]   Yeah, you would clap.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.800]   You'd lift your hands.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.880]   You'd bow.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.440]   You would barely be able to stop thanking him.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.780]   And I'm telling you,
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.140]   you don't have to physically see him
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.040]   to respond to him spiritually.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.660]   You can respond to him properly today.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.780]   And this man understood.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.160]   I don't have to see him to know how to respond.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.660]   If this is Jesus, the son of the living God,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.220]   please, Lord, have mercy on me.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:12.900]   Some of you, when you look at your life
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.940]   and you wonder, where's God?
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.100]   Where's Jesus?
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.000]   Why can't I see him clearly working in my life?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.340]   It's because you've made him just another good man
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.420]   and not Lord.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.760]   To see Jesus as Lord is to equate him
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.760]   to both power and authority.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.500]   To see him as all powerful and ultimate authority.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.800]   And I think a lot of us,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   we want Jesus, the friend of sinners,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.640]   but we don't want Jesus, the Lord of all people.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.080]   We want his friendship, but not his Lordship.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.680]   We want to be on mission,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.820]   but we still want to remain master.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.720]   And you just can't.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.460]   If you want a clear view of Jesus,
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.820]   you've got to understand who he is.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.660]   He is not simply Jesus from Nazareth.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.000]   He is Jesus, the son of God.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.500]   And because this man understood this,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.680]   his response was to shout.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.040]   And thankfully, he saw him right.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.940]   Let's look at verse 47.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.100]   "And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.780]   "he began to cry out and say,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.680]   "'Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!'
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.380]   "And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.320]   "But he cried out all the more,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.980]   "'Son of David, have mercy on me!'"
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.160]   Here we see the second thing
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.920]   that keeps us from seeing Jesus clearly in our lives.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.100]   You want man's approval over God's approval.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.640]   The second thing that keeps you from seeing Jesus clearly
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.740]   is that you'd rather have man's approval
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.400]   over God's approval.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.300]   You want to know why?
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.740]   Why can't I see God working in my life?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.280]   Why can't I see God moving in my life?
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.380]   Where is God?
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.880]   It's because insert approval of someone
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.380]   that's standing in the way of seeing him clearly.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   'Cause look at this.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.920]   He began to cry out.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.520]   He wanted to see and experience Jesus.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.700]   And people began to rebuke him and tell him to be silent.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.000]   I don't know what rebuking and silencing
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.200]   looks like in your life today.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.840]   I don't know what's prohibiting you
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.140]   from acknowledging and declaring Jesus
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.500]   as the son of God today.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.980]   It might be your dad's approval.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.240]   It might be your friends and what they think of you.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.340]   It might be your followers on Instagram
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.380]   that if you were to retweet that tweet
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.280]   about Roe versus Wade and about pro-life,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.580]   you don't know how people will respond at work.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.620]   It might be that if you say,
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.920]   hey, I'm gonna use pronouns the way God intended.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:05.360]   Hey, I'm gonna state what I believe about gay marriage.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   Hey, I'm going to be what God calls me to be
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.460]   no matter the cost.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.300]   That kind of faith,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.740]   it moves mountains for you to see God work in your life.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.740]   But if you are living for man's approval over God's approval,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.680]   you're gonna continue to strive
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   and look for man to validate and satisfy what only God can.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.160]   And I wanna say something to you.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.820]   I think one of the biggest struggles
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.120]   of young adults today is loneliness.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.060]   And so we make an idol of relationships
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.020]   and we make an idol of people
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.700]   at the expense of our relationship with God.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.020]   And I know it's scary.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.760]   I know that some of you have friend groups
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.300]   that you've had since you were in high school.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   And you think, man, if I radically change,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.040]   I wanna have no one.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.440]   I'm gonna be alone.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.100]   I'm not gonna have any friends at work.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.440]   I'm gonna be the weird guy.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   They're gonna talk about me, gossip about me.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.180]   They're gonna say things like this.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.440]   Oh, I bet you're not gonna drink tonight, you know,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.920]   'cause you're all Christian now.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.420]   Oh, look who's too good.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.020]   Or whenever they take a drink or they cuss
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.760]   or, you know, do something, they say, are you judging me?
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.360]   And suddenly, these people who once claimed
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.720]   to be your closest friends are now against you
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.300]   because you are closer to God.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.360]   And so I wanna say something very loud and clear
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.240]   that I had to learn the hard way.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.440]   If your friends want you, but not your God,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.980]   if they want you, but not your God,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.280]   then one, they are not true friends.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.080]   And two, your friends are probably your God.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.620]   If you're okay with allowing them to say,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.260]   hey, we want you, but not your God,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.860]   and you keep them as friends,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.200]   that's helping that your friends
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.120]   have sat in the throne of God.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.500]   And they, you say, hey, they are more important.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.460]   They can validate me.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.240]   They can bring me significance in ways that God can't.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.440]   Because think about this, if they were true friends,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.140]   true friends celebrate.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.080]   When your life gets better and is marked by peace
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.960]   and joy and love and all the things that come
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.320]   from relationship with God, if they were true friends,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.760]   they should celebrate all of you.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.460]   But if they start to say, hey, you're judging now,
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.160]   you're different, you're a radical, Jesus freak,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.940]   all these different things, what happened to you?
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.700]   You're boring.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.940]   Those are fake friends.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.200]   Those aren't real friends.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.940]   And if you allow that to continue and you change
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.380]   and you shrink your God to grow your followers
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.680]   or friend groups, that is why you cannot see God clearly
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.880]   in your life, because he's not God of your life.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.720]   People are.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.120]   Galatians 1:10 says,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   "For am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   "Or am I trying to please man?
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.200]   "If I were still trying to please man,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.800]   "I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.400]   Life is not about bowing down to the opinion,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.300]   approval of others.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.380]   And guys, I am the chief of this.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.840]   You think it's easy to get up here as one of you,
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.480]   a 28-year-old guy, and tell you what God's teaching me
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.620]   and try to teach his word?
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.520]   This is a weight and it's terrifying.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.600]   I have to constantly filter what it looks like
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.480]   to not bow down to the approval of others.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.120]   And when the enemy's really trying to work in my life,
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.080]   I'll experience no movement towards God
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   because I'm afraid of what others might think.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.280]   It looks like this.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.240]   Man, I'm gonna write this really spiritual post
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.320]   that God's putting on my heart to share with Instagram,
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   but what if people think I'm trying to be
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.280]   like some celebrity pastor or something?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.820]   Maybe I won't share this.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:10.880]   Or, man, people really like when David speaks.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.920]   I like when David speaks.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.260]   David's the director of this thing.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.280]   I kind of like the understudy.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.800]   And what if when the lights come up,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.400]   those people that brought their friends,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.160]   like I'm that guy that they're like elbowing,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.960]   they're like, I'm so sorry, dude, the vampire diary guy.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.520]   He ain't it, but come next week.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.560]   They don't give him two weeks in a row, trust me.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.400]   Let's just make it through.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   We can leave after the, you know.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.140]   And I think these thoughts,
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.000]   or I even have God giving me God-sized dreams
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.140]   and all these things, but what will so-and-so think?
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.180]   What will so-and-so think?
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.440]   And guys, I'm just telling you, it's a load of crap.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.460]   Because I am missing out on God's best for what?
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.880]   Some man's opinion?
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.200]   So many of us, we are sitting back
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.640]   and we're sitting on our hands
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.600]   and we aren't seeing God work in our lives
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.700]   because we are giving people too loud a voice.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.060]   And you have to realize,
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.460]   if you're surrounded by nothing but miserable people,
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.460]   miserable people want to see you miserable
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.940]   so they can feel less miserable about themselves.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.820]   Drake said it best, people wanna see you do better
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.900]   till you're doing better than them.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.840]   And it's true.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.580]   And you have to wake up and realize,
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.340]   am I letting man's opinions trump obedience to God?
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.500]   Am I letting opinions trump obedience?
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.020]   Imagine if this man had let man's opinions
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.120]   trump his obedience.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.020]   They said, "Hey, son of David, hey, shut up, shut up.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.780]   "Sit down, be quiet.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.780]   "He doesn't care about you, you blind beggar, sit down."
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.620]   Imagine all that he would have missed out on.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.180]   Literally a miraculous work in his life took place
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.380]   because he went against man's opinions
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.180]   and he responded properly
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.020]   'cause he had a clear view of who Jesus was.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.620]   He understood by faith, I'm going despite what anyone says.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.620]   And he shouted all the louder.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.700]   And some of you, your life looks like
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.460]   when people have tried to silence you, you've let them.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.060]   When they've told you, why'd you post that?
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.020]   You took it down.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.820]   God's calling you into ministry
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.900]   and you're worried what other people will think.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.780]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.860]   Why'd you go to college for this
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.180]   if you're just gonna go do ministry?
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.900]   Do you know what they pay in ministry?
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.860]   You're crazy.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.520]   Or God's calling you to get out of that relationship.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.380]   But then you wonder, am I gonna be alone?
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.500]   And you're letting the opinion of other people
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.340]   trump obedience to God.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.460]   And you wonder why you can't see him.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.940]   This man did not listen.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.780]   Instead, he cried out all the more
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.200]   and it changed everything.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.060]   We can't let other people sit on the throne of God.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.460]   I was thinking about back in my clubbing days.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:16.340]   You know, there's a science behind
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.420]   why it's so dark in the club, right?
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.580]   You're like, yeah, 'cause I ain't hitting it,
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.960]   you know, in the lights.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.020]   And it's true.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.540]   I mean, actually I low-key would,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.620]   but people are like, I wouldn't be acting the way I would
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.660]   if the lights weren't down.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.600]   We gotta get the lights down in this place.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.640]   And so we act a fool.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.720]   People are taking shots.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.640]   People are taking drinks.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.440]   People are bumping and grinding and twerking
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.680]   and all these different things.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.400]   And then the lights always inevitably come on.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.680]   And we're like cockroaches, scram, we get out of there.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.520]   Why?
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.320]   Because suddenly that 10's looking like a five.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.280]   Suddenly I was a 10, I'm looking like a five.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.160]   We got bags under our eyes, sweaty everywhere,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.360]   girl's hair is sticking down.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.560]   And we're like, oh Lord, get me to the car.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.020]   I want you to understand something.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.860]   Nothing changed about you.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.440]   The only thing changed is you were seen.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.900]   The lights came on.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.220]   And some of you tonight need to switch on the light
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.640]   in your mind and wake up and realize,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.140]   I'm surrounded by miserable people doing the same thing
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.240]   every single week, in, in, week in, week out,
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.560]   all desperate, looking for affirmation.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.600]   The job wasn't enough, so they're getting drunk.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.180]   They're getting confident because they're drunk.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.920]   And then they're looking for someone who accepted enough
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.860]   to hook up with them.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.340]   They regret it the next morning.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.400]   Maybe go to church if I'm not too tired.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.780]   Rinse and repeat.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.400]   And it's a miserable life.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.020]   And you need to turn the lights on.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.960]   And you need to put God back on the throne
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.640]   and choose obedience, not opinion.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.700]   That's how you'll see Him clearly.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.160]   The last thing we see here,
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.560]   verse 49,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.640]   most powerful part of this whole thing.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.320]   And Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.800]   And they called the blind man saying to him,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   "Take heart, get up, he is calling you."
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   And throwing off his cloak,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.640]   he sprang up and came to Jesus.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.760]   And Jesus said to him,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.320]   "What do you want for me to do?
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.400]   And the blind man said to him,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   "Rabbi, let me recover my sight."
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.180]   And Jesus said to him, "Go your way.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.780]   "Your faith has made you well."
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.020]   And immediately he recovered his sight
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.200]   and followed him on the way.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.660]   The last thing that prohibits us
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.680]   from seeing Jesus clearly in our life
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.020]   is we believe that Jesus wants part of us,
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.380]   but not all of us.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.900]   You believe that Jesus only wants part of you,
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.740]   not all of you.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.940]   Therefore, you only see part of Jesus.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.460]   When studying this, this part,
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.920]   I've read the story many times
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.400]   and I was searching out of all the gospels,
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.720]   which one do I want to preach on?
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   And it was this specific moment that just touched me.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.580]   And I found myself emotional reading it
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.620]   because I remembered my moment.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:10.000]   Can you understand the powerful moment
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.920]   that we just read about?
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.200]   Can you imagine for this man,
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.320]   a blind beggar all of his life,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.520]   and he has no hope.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   And then suddenly the man who he had heard about,
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.620]   who performed miracles, who changed lives,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.880]   who let the lame walk in the blind see,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.580]   he's walking by and he said,
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.200]   "I can't see, but I'm choosing in faith
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.800]   "to open up the eyes of my heart
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.200]   "and believe that this is the Messiah.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.040]   "And if so, have mercy on me."
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   And in faith, though everyone else
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.260]   was looking a different way,
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.680]   in faith he declared,
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.480]   "Jesus, son of God, have mercy on me."
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.020]   And something in him must have wondered
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.860]   what's gonna happen,
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.400]   'cause I can't see.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.520]   And I know some of you right now,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.160]   you're wondering with your relationship with God,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.840]   I can't see what's gonna happen.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.080]   And if you would just choose faith
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.600]   and going all in and giving all of yourself to Jesus,
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.200]   you will get the same response, I promise you.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.400]   Because in the moment,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.240]   though he couldn't see, he could hear.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.720]   And what did he hear?
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.600]   Take heart.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.040]   Some of you, the only thing you need to hear tonight
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.880]   is this point.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.800]   It's the most simple,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.400]   yet the most profound for your life
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.680]   if you would just believe it.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.400]   God is telling you tonight through me,
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   I am the crowd to you,
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.680]   telling you right now that Jesus sees you
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.440]   and he's saying to you specifically, take heart.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.800]   I see it.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.640]   I see the guilt, the shame, the addiction,
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.680]   the secret sin that no one knows about.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.440]   I see the pain, the brokenness,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.800]   that moment where you think that I was the reason
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.320]   why your dad died of cancer.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.160]   I see it.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.240]   And I'm telling you right now,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.700]   though your heart is weary, take heart.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.760]   Get up.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.200]   He's calling you.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.600]   And some of you tonight,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.700]   the most courageous thing you can do
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.640]   is to get up and understand he's calling me,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.480]   not part of you.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.920]   He's not saying, hey, I want this part of you,
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.120]   but let's keep the abortion tucked away.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.600]   That's too much.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.840]   Hey, I want this part of you,
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.520]   but hey, that secret sin of masturbation,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.360]   don't bring that over here.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.380]   That's disgusting.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.860]   I'm calling you, but hey, let's just keep this between.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.200]   No.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.160]   He is looking for people who will abandon themselves
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.160]   and unapologetically say, Jesus, Jesus, son of God,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.120]   I need you.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.320]   All of me needs all of you.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.240]   Call me John Legend, I'm in.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.180]   I want you.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.600]   And his response was call him.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.160]   He stopped in his tracks.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.580]   And Jesus, though he couldn't see Jesus,
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.960]   Jesus clearly saw him.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.040]   And he said, call him.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.760]   You might think, I can't see Jesus.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.640]   Where is he?
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.200]   I'm telling you, he sees you more clear
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.520]   than he ever has before.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.360]   He sees why you're here right now.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.280]   He sees what you're longing and looking for.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.000]   And he's saying, come on, I want all of it.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   I want all of you.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.100]   This really hits home for me because this is my story.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.740]   I grew up a pastor's kid in that small town
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.720]   of Union Grove, Texas,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.360]   and I was supposed to know all the things.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.540]   If anyone had the clearest of view,
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.360]   the front row seats to see Jesus clearly, it was me.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.200]   But something kept me from seeing him.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.920]   After sexual abuse was done to me
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   and many other things that sexually happened
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.040]   I was introduced to,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.240]   I began a secret path filled of sexual confusion.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.160]   And I thought, because I grew up in this church
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.480]   and I saw all these people who looked perfect,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.840]   I thought that God called JD,
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.880]   but just the parts that made sense.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.260]   JD, leave the confusion behind.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.420]   Like, let's keep that under wraps.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.700]   Christians aren't confused.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.220]   Christians are perfect.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.820]   Christians are put together.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.220]   That's what I thought.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.740]   God just wanted part of me,
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.820]   therefore I just gave part of me to God
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.780]   and only received part of him,
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.220]   resulting in me never clearly seeing him.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.700]   And that's some of you tonight.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.020]   And I'm telling you, the enemy shamed me
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.180]   and lied to me for a long time.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.340]   And it wasn't until I got to the end of myself
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.400]   and I saw people stand up for the first time
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.080]   and declare their sin and boast of their weakness
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.720]   and say, hey, I was a slave to sexual sin.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.920]   I was a slave to pornography.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.880]   I was a slave to alcohol and hookups
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.040]   and all these different things.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.280]   But Jesus, I remember that Jesus stepped out of heaven,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   lived a perfect life.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.360]   And while I was a sinner, died for me,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.720]   buried my sin in the grave and rose again and claimed victory
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.120]   so now I can have victory and I can stand here
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.800]   and simply give him all of me
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.000]   because he's given all of himself to me.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.620]   And it's changed everything.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.940]   And once I heard that, guys, it was groundbreaking.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.340]   It was groundbreaking.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.660]   It was revolutionary for me.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.740]   Like you mean that God wants all of me.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.420]   Okay, so I came and like this man,
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.860]   Jesus said, what do you want?
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.500]   What do you want for me to heal?
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.140]   I'll heal it.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.340]   What do you want to bring to me?
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.080]   If you surrender it, I've got you.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.220]   And I wanted something that I think
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.580]   every single one of us wants deep down.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.080]   I said, God, I just want to be fully known
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   and fully loved 'cause I'm exhausted.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:24.220]   I can't keep up this perfect preacher's kid act anymore.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.020]   I'm exhausted.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.980]   I want to be known and loved.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.760]   And it starts with you, God.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.080]   Do you truly fully want all of me?
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.480]   And he said, yes.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.680]   And tonight, some of you need to believe.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.060]   Like this man, he left his cloak.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.420]   The moment he heard that Jesus was calling him,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.020]   he left his cloak.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.140]   He didn't need it anymore.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.500]   He left it behind.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.260]   Like some of you need to leave your old past
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.220]   and your old life behind.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.500]   And he sprang up and he ran to Jesus
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.540]   and his sight was restored immediately.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.940]   And it says that he went on to follow Jesus on the way.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.660]   A lot of people believe that the reason why they put
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.140]   that his name was Bartimaeus is 'cause they believe
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.340]   that he actually became a disciple of Jesus,
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.020]   that he got to walk intimately with him
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.460]   and continue to see him work in the lives of others.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.140]   They believe that he was one of the early church planners
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.500]   when the church took off with the book of Acts.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   And it's because he went all in with Jesus.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.620]   Therefore, he saw him more clear than ever before.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.540]   He didn't need his physical sight to be restored
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.300]   because he saw everything he needed to see spiritually.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.620]   And you can too.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.180]   I started off this message with talking about how
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.380]   I think often, man, if I had known that I was
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.900]   with Cole Michelson from "Vampire Diaries,"
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.140]   how, what, what, was I an idiot that day?
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.380]   What did I talk about?
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.660]   I'm retracing everything I said.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.900]   I'm rethinking everything I asked.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.500]   I'm just making sure like, okay, what did I,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.940]   what did I, did I look a fool?
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.580]   And I, oh, if only I knew I would have spent time
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.540]   with him differently.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.620]   I would have asked more pointed questions.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.240]   I would have learned more and really soaked up the time.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:18.080]   But I missed it 'cause I didn't see Nathan.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.600]   I didn't truly understand who he was.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.980]   And the reason why, and I wanna leave you with this.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.620]   The reason why it's so important that you clearly see Jesus
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.860]   is because the Bible tells us that one day,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.180]   though right now we are still not able to physically see Him
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.220]   we have the opportunity now to spiritually see Him,
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.980]   but though we cannot physically see Him,
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.700]   one day we are going to see Him face to face.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.220]   We are going to see Him face to face.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.140]   And here's my prayer for the young adults of today.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.180]   Here's my prayer for myself.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.780]   Here's why I don't want us to miss it.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.980]   My fear is that one day, give it through death
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   or through the return of Jesus.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.300]   My fear is that we are gonna stand before Him.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.980]   We are gonna behold all that He is.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.800]   And for the first time, we are gonna most clearly see Him.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.440]   And we're gonna ask the question,
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.540]   why didn't I see it sooner?
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.940]   How did I miss it on earth?
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.140]   He was right there.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.620]   Every Tuesday I heard of His goodness.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.180]   Every Sunday churches were gathering.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.180]   If only I knew that this was who He was,
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.340]   if only I had chosen to spiritually see Him
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.860]   in my time on earth, everything would have been different.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.500]   I would have spent my time differently.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.420]   I would have had different kinds of relationships.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.180]   I would have trusted His design for my sexual life.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.740]   I would have done all these things different
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.360]   if only I had seen Him.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.940]   'Cause this, this is the best thing I've ever seen.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.420]   The Bible tells us that one day,
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.620]   whether you want to or not,
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.140]   whether you believe in Him or you don't,
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.020]   one day, every knee will bow
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:09.020]   and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.900]   And my prayer is that y'all choose today
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.500]   to not just see Him as another man,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.700]   but today to clearly see Him as Lord,
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.140]   and it will cause you to kneel today.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.380]   My prayer is that you won't let opinions of man
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.180]   keep you from obedience to God today.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.900]   My prayer is that you don't spend your life
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.660]   sheepishly approaching Jesus,
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.340]   but you say, "Hey, here's all of me."
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.060]   And you receive all of Him today.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.540]   And that when we come to that day,
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.060]   when we see Him clearly and every knee bows,
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.660]   it's just another day for you
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.780]   because you started bowing today.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.820]   That's my hope for us,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.500]   is that the people at the porch are going,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.580]   "Oh, I've been doing this.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.760]   "This is nothing new.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.620]   "This is who we are."
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.260]   Though I physically now behold Him,
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.100]   I spiritually saw Him today.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.180]   Tonight, Jesus is calling you.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.060]   I don't know where you're at or what your view is for Him.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.780]   I don't know how clear or unclear it is,
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.340]   but He's saying to every single one of us tonight,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.300]   "Take heart, get up.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   "I'm calling you."
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.140]   Let's pray.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.260]   Jesus,
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.380]   I thank you
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.700]   that you called me
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.220]   in my sin,
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.420]   in my shame and in my brokenness.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.540]   I thank you that I heard the call of, to take heart
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.820]   and to see you as Lord.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.060]   And I pray that if there's someone here tonight
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.140]   who can't see you at work,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.860]   that they would hear you right now,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.620]   call them by name,
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.060]   and they would get up,
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.100]   leave the cloak of their old life behind,
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.740]   leave their spiritual blindness behind,
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.340]   and that you would restore tonight their sight spiritually.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.180]   I don't know what's distorted their view,
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.820]   but tonight, would we experience restoration.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.180]   Anything that's distorted, would you restore it
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.180]   according to the power of your name?
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.940]   In the work of your spirit,
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.020]   may we respond to you properly because we see you clearly.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.900]   In your name that I pray, amen.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.740]   Let's respond.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.580]   Amen.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.400]   Let's respond.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
