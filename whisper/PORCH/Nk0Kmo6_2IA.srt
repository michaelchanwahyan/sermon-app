11

 All right.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,180
 Hello, friends in the room.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,300
 Hello, Fort Worth.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,180
 Any Disney World fans in this room?

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,340
 Anyone been to Disney World recently, like in the last year?

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:46,940
 There you go.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,440
 OK.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,340
 Is Disney World still awesome?

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,900
 Is it?

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,780
 Yeah?

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,460
 I definitely was when you were a kid, but it's like,

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,420
 this is amazing.

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,900
 So I'm going to tell a story that will kind of give us

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,460
 tracks forward.

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,180
 We're going about my one and only Disney World experience.

26
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,540
 We went as a family, family vacation.

27
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,540
 I was seven years old.

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,460
 I have three siblings.

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,020
 So me, the three siblings, and my two parents

30
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,340
 all went to Disney World.

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,300
 And it was amazing.

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,740
 Epcot, Magic Kingdom, whole nine yards.

33
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,420
 And on one of the days, we went to the Magic Kingdom.

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,460
 And the Magic Kingdom, stay there the whole day,

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,740
 stay there until the night.

36
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,940
 And Magic Kingdom is like the epicenter of Disney.

37
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,500
 They do this unbelievable fireworks show at night.

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,260
 Has anyone seen this before?

39
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,860
 It's like NASA gave them fireworks or something.

40
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,260
 They're like, are we still doing shuttles to the moon?

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,580
 Send this stuff to Disney.

42
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,580
 And they have these unbelievable,

43
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,860
 like things you've never seen before, light show fireworks.

44
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,500
 So we're there.

45
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,060
 It's at night.

46
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,900
 We gather.

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,820
 We're with all the people, huge crowd around us,

48
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,620
 me, three siblings, seven years old, watching the fireworks.

49
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,340
 It's awesome.

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,060
 And I look around.

51
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,060
 And there's these different little light fixtures

52
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,940
 in the ground.

53
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,060
 They're lights that would shoot up into the air.

54
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,260
 And they were like different colors.

55
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,060
 And you could walk around.

56
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,260
 And as you're seven, you're like, this is amazing.

57
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,700
 Purple.

58
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,020
 And it would make all your clothes purple.

59
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,780
 You'd send another one.

60
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,860
 Blue, make them blue.

61
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,700
 So I'm like walking over these lights,

62
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,100
 because I've always struggled with ADD.

63
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,220
 And the fireworks didn't keep me in check.

64
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,660
 And so I'm walking--

65
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,820
 I know, big shocker.

66
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,140
 So I'm walking over these lights.

67
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,940
 And I'm looking down at them.

68
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,700
 I'm standing there.

69
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,980
 And I'm like, this is amazing.

70
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,260
 And all of a sudden, someone comes up from behind me

71
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,980
 and pulls down my pants.

72
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
 And I mean everything.

73
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,060
 I'm exposed in front of Mickey, Minnie, and all of Disney World

74
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,860
 combined to see everything.

75
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,140
 And when you're seven, what else do you have to live for?

76
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,980
 So I look around.

77
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,540
 My older brother is taking off.

78
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,460
 So I begin running after him in that direction.

79
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,620
 He clearly had done this.

80
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,380
 So I'm chasing him.

81
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,020
 And now we're moving through the crowd of people,

82
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,300
 pushing women and children.

83
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,020
 And I'm trying to retaliate, get revenge on him.

84
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,940
 So you're going, where are we going with this?

85
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,140
 Can we talk about the Bible?

86
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
 And I'm running after him, pushing himself away.

87
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,500
 And I see him begin to run towards my parents.

88
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,220
 And I'm like, perfect, back into the arms of justice.

89
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,700
 Perfect.

90
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,380
 So we show up, get to my parents.

91
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,780
 And of course, my dad is upset.

92
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,460
 But dads are always upset on vacation.

93
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,060
 And so he's like, everyone in the car.

94
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,540
 Let's go.

95
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,460
 We're leaving.

96
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,420
 We get in the car, all four of us.

97
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,780
 And I'm like, just waiting for the punishment that

98
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,500
 is going to be relinquished on my brother.

99
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,380
 How could he do that?

100
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,100
 He's a bad apple.

101
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,900
 I agree with you.

102
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,460
 And so I'm waiting for this to happen.

103
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,460
 And my parents were not like the time out people.

104
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,380
 These are before that.

105
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,540
 They were the laying on of hands and a firm hand.

106
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,340
 You got the belt if you got in trouble.

107
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,540
 And so I'm waiting for this.

108
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,060
 How many spankings are we going to get, is what I'm thinking.

109
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,220
 How many is he going to get?

110
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,460
 One, two, maybe three to commemorate this experience.

111
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,540
 And all of a sudden, my dad says, David,

112
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,700
 you're going to get it.

113
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,180
 And I'm like, wait, time out.

114
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,980
 I go into seven-year-old lawyer mode.

115
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,540
 Wait a second.

116
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,900
 Just to make sure we have the facts straight here,

117
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,620
 I got pants in front of everybody.

118
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,220
 Remember that?

119
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,780
 Mickey, Minnie, everybody saw everything around us.

120
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,940
 And I'm the one in trouble.

121
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,980
 And he says, I don't care.

122
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
 You ran through the park, pushed people around.

123
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
 You embarrassed your parents.

124
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,140
 You're getting a spanking.

125
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,380
 I'm going, wait a second, Tom.

126
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,460
 I'm the victim here.

127
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
 Me, pantalones, on the ground.

128
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,220
 Me, not him.

129
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,380
 Why am I being punished?

130
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,700
 He says, you're the one who's getting a spanking right

131
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,060
 when we get back.

132
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,860
 I continue to try to duke it out.

133
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,140
 And I go, this is so unfair.

134
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
 This is so unjust.

135
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
 You know what happened?

136
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
 And finally, he agrees--

137
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,100
 I can't believe this actually happened.

138
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,740
 He agrees, I will let you not have a spanking,

139
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,380
 but you have to write a letter, a letter,

140
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,820
 to everyone in the family apologizing for ruining

141
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,860
 the magical kingdom.

142
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,540
 And I still to this day remember writing, I'm sorry.

143
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,380
 I got pants that did nothing wrong

144
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,460
 to everyone in the family.

145
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,820
 And it was just like, this is so unjust.

146
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,300
 Honestly, that's the earliest experience that I remember,

147
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,940
 of feeling like this is just an injustice.

148
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
 This is so unfair.

149
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,100
 This is wrong.

150
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,540
 I was the victim here.

151
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,980
 And there's something inside of us.

152
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,340
 Anytime that we are the victim in a situation

153
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,460
 where we want justice, we want retaliation,

154
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,140
 our natural response.

155
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
 And the reason I start there is because tonight,

156
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,820
 as we continue this series through the Sermon on the Mount

157
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,580
 and our series this summer on the Mount,

158
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,180
 Jesus is going to tell us what he says all Christians

159
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,180
 everywhere are to do in the face of injustice against them.

160
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,460
 In the face of when someone else hurts them,

161
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,380
 when someone else harms them, when someone else hates them,

162
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,820
 he says, this is what you are to do.

163
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,940
 Because I know that situation is kind of funny,

164
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,900
 but all of us in the room have one thing in common.

165
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,060
 Throughout our life, there will be various points

166
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,860
 where you are wrongfully hurt by someone,

167
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,340
 where you are the victim of other people's decisions,

168
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,060
 where someone hurts you, maybe someone hates you.

169
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,300
 Maybe it's at work with a coworker who always seems

170
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,940
 to like intentionally try to make you look bad.

171
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,500
 Or it's that one friend who spoke bad about you

172
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,900
 behind your back and now you don't trust anyone.

173
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,420
 Maybe it's a boss who just runs over you,

174
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,620
 neighbors who are always living, or who live above you,

175
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,380
 who are like always partying and you're like,

176
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,780
 it's a Wednesday, what are you doing up there?

177
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,780
 Maybe it's a parent who just walked out

178
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,540
 and they weren't what a mother or a father

179
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,380
 was supposed to be.

180
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,380
 Maybe it was a spouse that hurt you, that cheated on you,

181
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,620
 that all of us will face this.

182
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,580
 Honestly, probably the most clear place in this stage

183
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,460
 that we'll face it is like in the dating

184
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,740
 and relationship realm, where someone goes from,

185
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,300
 hey, they were calling me their bae before anyone else,

186
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,220
 and now they don't call me at all.

187
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,220
 And when I do see them, they're hurtful, and mean.

188
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,620
 But all of us will face just different circumstances

189
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,340
 where we are wrongfully hurt or wrongfully harmed,

190
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,020
 and so how are we to respond in those situations?

191
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,580
 So tonight, Jesus is gonna explore that,

192
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,540
 and we're gonna see some of his most radical teachings

193
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,620
 on relationships, and here's what I know

194
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,820
 just before we dive in.

195
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,420
 What Jesus is going to say, this is just a guarantee

196
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,260
 for you guys and for Fort Worth.

197
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,580
 What Jesus is about to say about how you and I,

198
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,580
 or how Christians, are to relate to those who hurt us,

199
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,860
 how we're to really exist in relationships,

200
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,060
 if you and I embrace it, if you embrace it,

201
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,740
 it will change your world.

202
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,140
 The teachings we're gonna talk about,

203
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,220
 your circle, your relationships, and if the church,

204
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,860
 if every person in our country or in our world

205
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,580
 who claims the name of Jesus embraces

206
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,500
 what Jesus is about to say, it will change our world.

207
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,140
 So we're gonna pick it up in Matthew chapter five.

208
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,800
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there right now.

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,780
 Matthew chapter five, Matthew's the very first book

210
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,300
 of the New Testament.

211
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,260
 If you hit Mark, Luke, John, or really anything

212
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,580
 with Ippians on it, you need to flip back

213
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,340
 and go back to Matthew, and we'll be in chapter five

214
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,820
 as Jesus just continues this teaching

215
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,180
 on the Sermon on the Mount.

216
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,860
 If you don't have a Bible, we've got some

217
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,580
 in the Welcome Center, and those are our gift to you,

218
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,620
 so you can take that afterwards.

219
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
 It's gonna be on the screen, I believe, if not.

220
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,780
 So we'll pick it up in verse 38, and here we go.

221
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,100
 You have heard that it was said, Jesus speaking,

222
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,340
 to this crowd in front of him on a hillside.

223
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,540
 You have heard that it was said, an eye for an eye

224
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,700
 and a tooth for a tooth.

225
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,980
 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person,

226
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,860
 and if anyone slaps you on the right cheek,

227
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,200
 turn to him the other cheek also.

228
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,280
 So Jesus just quotes an Old Testament verse

229
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,300
 about eye for an eye, which is a metaphor

230
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,700
 for a justice system.

231
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
 It's essentially, it was common in Jesus' day

232
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,580
 that the punishment needed to fit the crime,

233
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,340
 that basically if someone caused you to lose an eye,

234
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,220
 they need to lose an eye.

235
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,660
 If someone caused you to lose a camel,

236
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,140
 they need to lose a camel, that there needs to be

237
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,500
 a repayment that fits the punishment of the crime,

238
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,980
 that getting even was a part of an allowance

239
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,820
 inside of that law.

240
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,980
 It's really, I mean, when you think about it,

241
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,260
 it's like, yeah, it's a pretty good law.

242
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
 We would all say that today, even today.

243
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,500
 We think, as it relates to relationships,

244
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,700
 we are about getting payback, aren't we?

245
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,820
 I mean, when it comes to someone who hurt me

246
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,440
 or someone who did something, and I may not do

247
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,980
 the exact hurt against them that they did against me,

248
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,680
 but my mind runs to, I need to pay this person back.

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,420
 I need to be mean to them because they were hurtful to me.

250
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,180
 And the way that I want to treat them

251
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,940
 is about getting payback.

252
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,380
 That's my initial reaction, or really all of us

253
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,020
 in the room have that reaction.

254
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,540
 With that girl who breaks girl code

255
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,020
 and starts braiding, dating your, braiding?

256
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,380
 Braiding your old boyfriend.

257
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,700
 They're braiding his hair.

258
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,940
 And starts dating your old boyfriend.

259
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,680
 It's like, I'm gonna cut you off from my life.

260
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,380
 Jesus may love you, but I do not.

261
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,880
 That coworker who makes you look bad,

262
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,220
 we begin taking opportunities to get payback.

263
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,400
 And eye for an eye, I'm going to,

264
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,760
 and it may not be a perfect eye for an eye,

265
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,600
 but I'm going to do something to make you pay for it.

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
 Maybe it's apparent that we're just,

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,040
 I'm gonna cut you off relationally

268
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
 to make you be punished for what you've done.

269
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,160
 Or the girl who broke up with you

270
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,840
 because she wasn't ready to date,

271
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,000
 and then on Facebook, a week later,

272
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,420
 it's like, she's ready to date with someone else,

273
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,440
 apparently, and we're just going,

274
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,820
 I'm just gonna talk bad about you.

275
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,540
 And Jesus says, I want to give you

276
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,300
 an entire new way of relating to people,

277
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,600
 and it's not to hit them back,

278
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,220
 and he uses the metaphor of turning

279
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,060
 the other cheek when struck, but it's still a metaphor.

280
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,700
 He says, don't hit them back.

281
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,900
 Don't hit replay on the situation

282
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,000
 and just drive around in your car,

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,940
 listening to Taylor Swift like,

284
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,900
 ♪ Now we got bad blood ♪

285
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
 ♪ We used to have ♪

286
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,740
 Oh man.

287
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,420
 (audience laughing)

288
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,260
 ♪ Now we ♪

289
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,460
 I don't know, I just keep singing up here.

290
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,340
 It's like, is this a concert?

291
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,780
 Where are we at right now?

292
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
 It's not to do that.

293
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,880
 It's not to listen around,

294
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,180
 driving around listening to Taylor Swift.

295
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,260
 He says, I don't want you to hit replay,

296
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,660
 and I don't want you to hit back,

297
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,940
 but here's what I want you to do.

298
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,020
 Turn the other cheek if someone strikes you,

299
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,500
 and he introduces this metaphor,

300
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,020
 and really, essentially, here's what Jesus is saying.

301
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,420
 I don't want my people,

302
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,180
 if you wanna know what a Christian response

303
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,860
 to someone who hurts you is,

304
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,500
 it's not to be about hurting them back or retaliation.

305
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,980
 It's about reconciliation.

306
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,700
 What do Christians do when they're hurt?

307
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,100
 They don't seek on getting retaliation,

308
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,380
 but on reconciliation.

309
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,500
 He says, I want to introduce how you were to relate

310
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,920
 when someone hurts you.

311
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,380
 Our first point is a Christian's response

312
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,580
 to those who harm them is forgiveness,

313
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,020
 that he describes just like in turning the other cheek,

314
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,940
 eye for an eye is a metaphor, so is turning the other cheek.

315
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,420
 It's not just, oh yeah, come on, keep it coming.

316
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,700
 It is starting new with that person,

317
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,060
 removing the hurt and starting over,

318
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,260
 forgiving that person, Jesus says.

319
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,780
 Anytime that someone hurts you, someone hurts me,

320
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,740
 the response, a Christian's response

321
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,460
 to someone who hurts them is forgiveness.

322
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,200
 It's like, Jesus, that's a little extreme.

323
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,860
 In every situation, no matter what they've done,

324
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,020
 I'm supposed to forgive them?

325
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,460
 And he says, yes, to every hurt and to every harm,

326
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,820
 to the person who lied about you behind your back,

327
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,080
 to that parent, the response is to turn the other cheek,

328
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,120
 to start new, to forgive them.

329
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,640
 To DeAndre Jordan, when he says, I'm coming,

330
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,020
 and then says, just kidding, to forgive.

331
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,460
 That our response in every situation,

332
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,620
 from big and small, is that you are to forgive them.

333
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,180
 Don't take a step back and plot revenge

334
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,540
 or take a step back and replay the tapes on how could they.

335
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,400
 Take a step forward towards reconciling the relationships.

336
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,520
 And I think where I get stuck is I begin to think,

337
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,500
 look, if I do that, I'm going to look weak

338
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,660
 or it's going to appear weak or that's just weak.

339
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,060
 I'm just letting them run all over me.

340
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,020
 And the Bible teaches this crazy thing.

341
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,340
 Retaliation is not a sign of strength.

342
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,300
 It's a sign of weakness.

343
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,620
 God, in fact, says, don't retaliate.

344
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,720
 I want you to trust me.

345
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,460
 In Romans 12, retaliation is a sign of weakness

346
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,420
 'cause it says, I don't trust that you, God,

347
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,700
 who say vengeance is yours, are going to do what is right.

348
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,880
 And Jesus says, it is a sign of weakness if you retaliate.

349
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
 I want you to turn the other cheek, forgive that person,

350
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,820
 and to trust God that there will be a day

351
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,980
 where there is reckoning, where God says, vengeance is mine,

352
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,220
 and he doesn't look at you and me

353
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,180
 and all the hurts that you experience and say,

354
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,820
 it's not because I don't care.

355
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,440
 It's not because what they did wasn't wrong.

356
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,780
 All of it was wrong.

357
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,700
 That hurt, that abuse, that pain, everything was wrong.

358
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,180
 And it's not because I want them to get away with it

359
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,640
 or I don't care about how you're feeling.

360
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,780
 That's not why God does it.

361
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,280
 It's because I care about you and there is a day

362
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,140
 where I am going to have a reckoning for every abuse,

363
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,460
 every pain, everything that's ever been done wrong.

364
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,780
 And I'm inviting you now to forgive

365
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,380
 and to turn the other cheek.

366
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,340
 That I don't look lightly on the pains of my children,

367
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,900
 but now I want you to forgive.

368
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,140
 God is like the ultimate father

369
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,620
 that's like sitting on the front porch with a shotgun.

370
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,460
 You know what I'm talking about?

371
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,200
 He's like in a wife theater like, have her home by 10.

372
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,460
 And you're like, I'm just gonna have her home now, okay.

373
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,260
 That's who God is, that he says that to all of his children.

374
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,180
 There will be no wrongs that do not get made right

375
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,980
 or there will be no wrongs where there isn't a reckoning for

376
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,580
 and I'm inviting you now to forgive.

377
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,740
 The Christian response in every situation

378
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,620
 which feels extreme, Jesus says,

379
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,800
 is to turn the other cheek or to forgive.

380
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,900
 And let me say this really quickly.

381
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
 This is a side note on physical abuse in marriage.

382
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,760
 More conversations probably in the last 10 days

383
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,740
 have I had or our team had with people

384
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,220
 who have been a part of an abusive relationship.

385
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,860
 And so what I wanna make really, really clear,

386
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,100
 'cause this has been something that's come up a lot.

387
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,620
 Are you saying that Jesus' teaching on divorce

388
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,300
 and remarriage and is the teaching on turn the other cheek,

389
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
 does that mean that God wants them to go back

390
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,180
 into an abusive environment?

391
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,840
 No.

392
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,840
 If someone is in a violent environment,

393
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,900
 we based on the character of God would say

394
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,500
 they need to step out of that environment

395
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,060
 because it's not loving.

396
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,700
 Jesus' whole point is be about reconciling the relationship

397
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,740
 and it is all to be done in love

398
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,540
 and it's not loving to stay there

399
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,860
 and be abused.

400
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,940
 The most loving thing is to get out,

401
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,960
 pray for that person, pursue reconciliation

402
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,260
 by just praying for them.

403
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,380
 Call the police if they're in an abusive environment.

404
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,700
 But as a church, if someone is in your community group,

405
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
 if that's a question you need to know,

406
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,780
 how you would answer that.

407
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,480
 We would never say to stay in a place

408
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,300
 where you are potentially in danger

409
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,500
 and we do not believe that God would.

410
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,660
 And the most loving thing in that scenario

411
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
 is not to stay there and just turn the other cheek,

412
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,840
 but to remove yourself 'cause his point

413
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,020
 is reconciliation of a relationship.

414
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,740
 So inside of marriage, that would be the answer

415
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,700
 that Jesus keeps going and really addresses

416
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,220
 what to do if we harm someone.

417
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,940
 Verse 40, if anyone wants to sue you

418
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,260
 and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.

419
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,940
 So anyone sues you, that would be a time

420
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,260
 where you've done something wrong.

421
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,220
 So they're gonna sue you and he essentially says,

422
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,860
 hey, don't just do the bare minimum.

423
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,540
 If you wronged that person, don't go,

424
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,180
 hey, what's the bare minimum I can do here?

425
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,540
 Make it right.

426
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,500
 Be about restoring the relationship,

427
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,420
 reconciliation, verse 41.

428
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,560
 If anyone forces you to go a mile,

429
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,780
 go with them two miles.

430
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,260
 Give to the one who asks of you

431
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,860
 and do not turn away from the one

432
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
 who wants to borrow from you.

433
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,900
 Now here, when we read that, everyone's like,

434
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700
 what, Jesus is concerned about how far I walk?

435
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,320
 What Jesus just said, everyone in his audience

436
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,780
 is now sucking air because what Jesus just said

437
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,380
 pointed to something that was very a part

438
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,140
 of their every single day life.

439
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,260
 Here's what he just said.

440
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,380
 If someone asks you to go a mile, go with them two.

441
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,620
 Here's why that was a part of everyday life.

442
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,260
 Inside of where they were right now,

443
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,580
 which is in Jerusalem and in Judea, which is that area,

444
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,260
 the entire area and really the known world

445
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,320
 was ruled by this one army, Rome,

446
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,060
 by the Roman army, by the Roman Empire.

447
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,260
 And so everywhere that you went,

448
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,480
 anywhere inside of the empire,

449
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,580
 there were soldiers everywhere

450
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,500
 because Rome was ruthless and they wanted to make sure

451
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,240
 you don't mess with, you mess with the bull,

452
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,100
 you get the horns.

453
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,780
 And so if you mess with Rome, you're going to pay for it.

454
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,500
 So they put soldiers everywhere.

455
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,220
 How did they pay for those soldiers?

456
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,820
 They taxed their people 80 to 90%.

457
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,800
 Imagine that.

458
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,620
 We're like, Obamacare, and they're 80 to 90%.

459
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,460
 80 to 9%.

460
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,620
 And so of course, everyone is,

461
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,940
 it's not a statement or official stance on Obamacare.

462
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,020
 That's more just like taxes.

463
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,320
 Save the email.

464
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,820
 Okay, so everyone in this time is going,

465
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,980
 we hate Rome because we're giving everything

466
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,540
 we have away to have soldiers around

467
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,820
 that basically have hurt our siblings,

468
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,480
 have hurt our cousins, some of them been killed

469
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,860
 and crucified, all by these Roman soldiers who we hate.

470
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,180
 And they had this one law that said any,

471
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,440
 this is the mile thing, any Roman soldier, Roman law,

472
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,300
 and if you step out of line with Roman law, you die.

473
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,500
 And any Roman soldier can come up to any civilian they want

474
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,380
 and say, carry my armor for a mile.

475
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,040
 It was a Roman law to give soldiers a break.

476
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,080
 So any civilian, any Jewish person,

477
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,040
 they could come up and say, I want you to carry the weapons

478
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,700
 that were used to kill some of your family members

479
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,980
 for a mile.

480
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,580
 And they had to do it.

481
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,940
 And so of course, they're going, we hate this law.

482
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,780
 We hate that.

483
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,020
 And Jesus looks at them and says,

484
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,700
 I want you to carry it two miles.

485
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
 I mean, think about that.

486
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,700
 Think about it today if there was a law like that

487
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,460
 and the police were like, yeah, I need you to drive me

488
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,300
 for the next mile.

489
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,460
 Or if you're living in the first century,

490
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,260
 how do you even make plans with people?

491
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,900
 And you're like, yeah, you wanna meet at Petalicious

492
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,920
 in Jerusalem and we'll go down there.

493
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,120
 And you're like, they never show up.

494
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,960
 They got caught.

495
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,480
 They had to walk a mile and then they had to walk

496
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
 a mile back.

497
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,360
 And every single day and everywhere they looked,

498
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,400
 this would be enforced.

499
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,800
 And Jesus just said, even to your enemies,

500
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,280
 I want you to go above and beyond in loving them.

501
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,240
 And it's as though they're going, Jesus,

502
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,880
 how can we do that with our enemies?

503
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,440
 And he says, on the note of enemies, let's go there next.

504
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,300
 You've heard that it was said, verse 43,

505
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,400
 love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

506
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,380
 Finally, Jesus, these audiences, thank you,

507
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,000
 you're saying something we agree with.

508
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
 Love your neighbor, hate your enemy.

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray

510
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,760
 for those who persecute you,

511
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,540
 that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

512
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,840
 He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good

513
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,500
 and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

514
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,780
 That no longer, Jesus says, for my followers,

515
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,200
 is the standard, love their neighbor and hate their enemy.

516
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
 I don't want there to be any boundaries on love.

517
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,460
 All people, you are to not love.

518
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,180
 And really, what's crazy is pray for your enemies.

519
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,800
 Think, to us, you may have heard it before

520
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,500
 and you're like, yeah, it's so beautiful.

521
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,940
 To them, they're hearing it for the very first time,

522
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,880
 they go, Jesus, pray for your enemies.

523
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
 Enemies to us is kind of abstract.

524
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
 To them, it was this guy in the Roman armor.

525
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,280
 And they're going, pray for our enemies?

526
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,120
 You want us to pray?

527
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,600
 Jesus, we don't even pray for our friends.

528
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
 You serious, pray for our enemies?

529
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,860
 I mean, most of us, we pray for like grandma

530
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,280
 and this food and one sick guy that we know.

531
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,320
 And you're telling us to pray for our enemies?

532
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,800
 How radical is this?

533
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,240
 And Jesus says, yes, even them, I want you to pray for.

534
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,620
 That I want no boundaries to be put on love.

535
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,680
 And I think as an American, where I get caught in like,

536
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,880
 how do I apply this?

537
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,540
 Like, who are my enemies?

538
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,280
 ISIS, Time Warner Cable?

539
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,220
 Like, who is my enemy?

540
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,180
 AT&T?

541
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,520
 And I think what Jesus would say,

542
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,880
 if you don't think you have enemies, great.

543
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,320
 The standard is love all people.

544
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,760
 Love the people who on social media

545
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,760
 call you a bigot for what you believe.

546
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,060
 Love the people who hate you

547
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,600
 because the color of your skin.

548
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,580
 Love the people who treat you poorly at work.

549
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,040
 Love every single person.

550
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,180
 Your response is to be loved and to pray for them.

551
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,280
 And I love the next verse, which says in 45,

552
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,340
 that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven.

553
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,160
 That you will look in doing so like your Father.

554
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,240
 Like, what do children do as it relates to their parents?

555
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,080
 They look like them.

556
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,100
 My wife is pregnant right now.

557
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,440
 She's 18 weeks pregnant.

558
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,600
 And every time that we go to the doctor,

559
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 they do a sonogram, which is a really interesting experience

560
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,280
 but save that for another time.

561
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,120
 And so while we're there,

562
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
 they will show us the baby inside of her.

563
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,760
 And it looks like a little alien right now,

564
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
 but here's what I know.

565
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,480
 The more that it grows and develops,

566
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,360
 and the older and more mature that it gets,

567
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
 the more it's going to look like its parents.

568
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,880
 Hopefully its mother.

569
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
 But the more that it continues to grow,

570
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,280
 the more it looks like its parents.

571
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,040
 Because children look like their parents,

572
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
 just kind of the way things work.

573
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,200
 And Jesus just said, here's what I want you to do.

574
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,680
 I want you to be the kind of person

575
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,620
 that even in the face of hatred,

576
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,360
 the Christian response toward those who hate us,

577
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,400
 which is our second point, is love.

578
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
 I want you to do that.

579
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,380
 And when you do that, here's what you look like.

580
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,080
 You look like your Father in heaven.

581
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 He's a God who loves his enemies.

582
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
 He's a God who loves those who run from him.

583
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,040
 He's a God who loves bad people.

584
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,320
 As bad as you may be in the room, if you don't know that,

585
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,800
 God is a God who loves you right now where you are.

586
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,120
 He's a God who loves every person that's ever lived,

587
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,000
 ever been born, made in his image.

588
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
 And he says, when you love like that,

589
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,340
 you love and you look like your Dad in heaven.

590
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,240
 There's actually a story of someone in the Bible

591
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,520
 who in dying, prays for those persecuting him,

592
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,200
 or prays for those who are killing him.

593
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,120
 You know who it is?

594
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,280
 Jesus, there you go.

595
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,200
 Safe church answer, I like that.

596
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
 (congregation laughing)

597
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,440
 It's Jesus on the cross, Luke 23.

598
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,920
 Says that even in the Son of God's last breaths,

599
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,840
 he knows everything, he knows everything

600
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,280
 that they would ever do, and he looks out

601
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,040
 at those who just drove nails through the palms of his hands

602
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,080
 and he says, Father, forgive these men.

603
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,520
 Have mercy on these men.

604
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,360
 Forgive them.

605
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,640
 That even in his dying breaths, he loves his enemies.

606
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,640
 But there's actually another place in Scripture

607
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,480
 and another man who says something eerily similar

608
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,080
 to what Jesus said.

609
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,920
 Anyone know who it is?

610
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,440
 Stephen, man, we have the most educated crowd, I love it.

611
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,940
 Stephen, so let me tell you about Stephen

612
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,780
 if you're new in the room.

613
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,440
 Stephen, who says something very similar.

614
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
 Here's who Stephen is.

615
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,080
 Stephen is the very first martyr of the church.

616
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,280
 No one's ever been killed, no one had been persecuted

617
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,160
 other than Jesus.

618
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,680
 The church movement begins and Stephen would become

619
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,180
 the very first martyr, but here's how it begins.

620
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,920
 Jesus goes back to heaven and really,

621
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,420
 the movement explodes.

622
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,700
 There's like thousands of people getting saved,

623
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,960
 things are taking off, they're going well.

624
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,940
 And there's so many people that they begin to realize,

625
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,160
 oh my gosh, the 12 dudes, they're not gonna cut it.

626
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,380
 We need a details guy.

627
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,840
 Peter, you're not a details guy.

628
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,620
 We need somebody who can execute around here.

629
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,920
 So they bring in a guy named Stephen.

630
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,260
 Stephen is a details guy.

631
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,980
 Anyone, anyone, any detail people in the room?

632
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,820
 God bless you people.

633
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,740
 Anyone who's like Excel spreadsheet,

634
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,860
 holla at your girl, that's me, okay.

635
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,700
 That's Stephen.

636
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
 Stephen is a guy who's like, I'm a details guy,

637
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,460
 I'm an executor, I love Excel, that's who he is.

638
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,140
 And Stephen is put in charge inside of thousands of people

639
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,780
 of caring for the widows and the orphans,

640
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,420
 making sure they get food, making sure they get all this.

641
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,180
 And that's who Stephen is.

642
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,900
 And shortly after that, Stephen really begins going around

643
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,140
 and his new faith, he begins sharing his faith everywhere.

644
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,100
 He begins going around the city of Jerusalem saying,

645
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,820
 hey Jesus, if you trust in Jesus, you can have eternal life.

646
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,060
 If you believe in Jesus, he's the Messiah.

647
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,660
 And he goes all over the city and pretty soon,

648
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,300
 this Sanhedrin or the like court system,

649
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,900
 Jewish religious leaders found out

650
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,220
 that Stephen is preaching?

651
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,820
 Nah, Stephen is going around.

652
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,420
 We were okay with the 12 dudes, they're a little off it.

653
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,260
 We're okay with that.

654
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,720
 But Stephen, we know Stephen, he's going around telling,

655
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,580
 Jesus is the only way?

656
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,880
 Uh-uh, that's bad for business.

657
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,100
 Bring Stephen in here.

658
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,180
 They bring Stephen, they drag him and they throw him

659
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,380
 in front of the Sanhedrin, which is the court of the day.

660
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,380
 And they throw him in front of the court.

661
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,860
 And they say, Stephen, we hear that you've been telling

662
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,700
 people Jesus is the Messiah, is it true?

663
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,180
 And this is in Acts 6, 7, and 8,

664
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,500
 if you wanna go read it later.

665
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,740
 And he says, yes, Jesus is, he's the only way

666
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,820
 to eternal life.

667
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,260
 And they bring in these different people,

668
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,540
 some men in the crowd bring in different people

669
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,840
 to make accusations, to make up accusations,

670
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,940
 lies about him.

671
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,740
 Well, I saw him do this, I saw him do this.

672
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,900
 And Stephen says, I didn't do any of that.

673
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,380
 All I did was say, Jesus is the only way.

674
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,260
 And anyone who believes in him will not perish,

675
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,500
 but has eternal life.

676
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,220
 And they look at Stephen and he begins to give

677
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,780
 this incredible speech.

678
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,980
 You can go read it later.

679
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,100
 And at the end of the speech, which culminates in him

680
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,740
 saying, Jesus alone, trust in Jesus,

681
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,340
 they rip their clothes.

682
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,580
 And the Sanhedrin says, this man deserves to die.

683
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,780
 And they drag him outside of the city.

684
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,100
 And they prepare to stone him.

685
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,240
 Outside of crucifixion, stoning was one of the worst ways

686
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,080
 to die.

687
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,140
 They pelt you with rocks until you're dead.

688
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,820
 And Stephen looking at these men who are beginning

689
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,040
 to stone him says two last things.

690
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,940
 The last two things or sentences he would ever say.

691
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,740
 And the first one is eerily similar to what we just read.

692
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,420
 He looks into the eyes of the men who were pelting him

693
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,600
 with rocks.

694
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,460
 And he says, father, forgive these men.

695
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,220
 Have mercy on them, God.

696
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,680
 They don't know what they're doing.

697
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,080
 He looks like Jesus.

698
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,460
 And then he says something else that only appears here

699
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,560
 in all of the Bible.

700
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,220
 It says in one of his last statements,

701
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,700
 he's sitting there on the ground and they say his face

702
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,740
 shunned like an angel.

703
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,980
 And all of a sudden they see Stephen looking up

704
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,060
 at the heavens.

705
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,380
 And he says, I see the heavens open.

706
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,300
 And the son of God is standing at the right hand of God.

707
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,020
 Standing, Stephen, you see Jesus standing.

708
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,540
 Standing, why is that significant?

709
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,860
 And every other place in the Bible,

710
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,620
 Jesus is always seated at the right hand of God.

711
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,900
 And there's a lot of them, Old and New Testament.

712
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,400
 And it's as though in Stephen's last breaths,

713
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,920
 Jesus who looks down and says,

714
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,300
 I'm gonna see you in a second.

715
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,140
 But he rises like the crowd when a bride enters the room

716
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,220
 to give a standing ovation to this man

717
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,740
 who looks like his daddy.

718
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,960
 That's my boy.

719
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,780
 And he looks like Jesus.

720
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,580
 Father, forgive these men.

721
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,260
 The only time we see the son of God rise,

722
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,300
 kings don't rise.

723
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,320
 They're always seated victorious.

724
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,540
 And Jesus stands as he sees the son or a man

725
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,300
 who looks like his father in heaven,

726
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,660
 loving even his enemies, even in his last breaths.

727
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,780
 And he calls all of us that the response to those

728
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,980
 who hate us and hurt us is love.

729
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,420
 And he finishes up and really gives our final response.

730
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,060
 He says this in verse 46.

731
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,420
 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

732
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,380
 Are not even tax collectors doing that?

733
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,660
 And if you greet only your own people,

734
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,080
 what are you doing more than others?

735
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,060
 Don't even pagans or people who don't believe in God

736
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,100
 at all do that?

737
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,660
 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect.

738
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,660
 You and I are to treat others like God treats his enemies

739
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,820
 or like God has treated us.

740
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,380
 Essentially what he just said, be perfect.

741
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,440
 I want you to be in the way you respond to others perfect.

742
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,620
 That's the goal.

743
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 And by perfection, I mean the same way God responds

744
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,940
 to his enemies, the same way God responds.

745
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,580
 In other words, a Christian responds

746
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,700
 the way Christ has responded to them.

747
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,500
 A Christian responds to all people, all their enemies,

748
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,240
 the way God responds to his enemies

749
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,740
 or the way God has responded to them,

750
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,180
 that we as believers in Jesus, he says,

751
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,940
 are to treat others who hurt us, not as they've treated us,

752
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,500
 but as God has treated us.

753
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,780
 That you and I are to treat in the response,

754
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,820
 regardless of the situation, which is such a tall order,

755
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,700
 are not to treat them the way they treated us

756
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,780
 or even the way others say, yeah, I would do this,

757
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 but the way God has treated us

758
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,020
 or the way God has treated his enemies,

759
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,380
 of which we were a part.

760
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,500
 Probably the clearest portrait of Jesus loving his enemies,

761
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,860
 I read this past week and it was so powerful to me

762
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,380
 'cause I've never noticed it before.

763
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,960
 It's in Jesus's last day on earth.

764
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,860
 Like he's got one more day left

765
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,700
 and what he decides to do with his time

766
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,860
 is he gets all of his boys together

767
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,500
 at what's called the last supper.

768
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,460
 And he doesn't do what you and I would wanna do,

769
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,860
 hey, what can we do on the last day?

770
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,940
 I've got one day left.

771
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,020
 Doesn't do what we do.

772
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,900
 He begins to get down on his hands and knees

773
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,140
 and do what only a servant did.

774
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,700
 Here's what it says in John 13.

775
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,560
 The evening meal was in progress, verse two,

776
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,960
 and the devil had already prompted Judas,

777
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,080
 who's at the meal, so it's Jesus and the 12 boys,

778
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,800
 including Judas, who's already decided

779
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,920
 I'm gonna betray this man for 30 shekels of silver.

780
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,040
 I'm betraying him.

781
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,800
 Luke 23 says that Judas had some way,

782
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,600
 in some way, been inhabited by Satan,

783
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
 that he'd given his heart over to the point

784
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,020
 where Satan was a part of it.

785
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,480
 And now Jesus sitting there with his 12 boys

786
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,880
 and Judas, who's already inhabited

787
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,440
 or given himself over to Satan,

788
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,280
 to betray Jesus, is sitting there with him.

789
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,200
 And what does Jesus do?

790
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,840
 The devil had already prompted Judas,

791
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,960
 the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.

792
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,440
 Jesus knew that the Father had put all things

793
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
 under his power, that he could do anything.

794
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
 I could blink and Judas would just disappear.

795
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,780
 And that he had come from God and was returning to God,

796
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,040
 so he got up from the meal,

797
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,600
 he took off his outer clothing,

798
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,540
 he wrapped a towel around his waist,

799
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,520
 and after that he poured water into a basin

800
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,940
 and he began washing the disciples' feet,

801
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,000
 drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

802
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,340
 That Jesus, in his last moments,

803
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,960
 he gets down on his hands and knees.

804
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,020
 The Son of God, perfection in sandals,

805
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,640
 gets on his knees and he begins washing the feet.

806
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,560
 Here's why that's significant.

807
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,240
 Rabbis didn't wash feet.

808
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,800
 Normal people didn't wash feet.

809
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,200
 That was only for a servant.

810
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,340
 This would only be something that would happen

811
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,920
 when you'd go into the home of someone

812
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,480
 who had means enough to have a servant.

813
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,280
 It's like going to the home of someone today

814
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,160
 that has means enough to have a valet or something.

815
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
 You're like, you have a valet?

816
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,620
 Really, where does he sleep?

817
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,040
 It's like showing up at a house like that

818
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,640
 and only rich people would have this

819
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,680
 and Jesus takes the role of a servant and he gets down

820
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,640
 and he begins taking off the sandals

821
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,520
 and washing these feet that are caked with dirt

822
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,040
 from being in a desert climate

823
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,920
 and he begins doing what only a servant would do.

824
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,320
 God begins washing and he doesn't just choose the 11.

825
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,520
 He looks his enemy, Judas, who's inhabited by Satan

826
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
 and he looks him in the eyes

827
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,200
 and he begins washing his feet

828
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,360
 that even in his last moments, he would have a Judas.

829
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,540
 He still loves, I love Judas.

830
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,420
 I'm gonna die for him in all of humanity.

831
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,560
 That's how God responds to his enemies

832
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,100
 and tonight, what I wanna make really clear

833
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,660
 is the invitation that Jesus calls all of us to

834
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,260
 is he says, I want you to love like that.

835
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,660
 I want you to treat others who've hurt you,

836
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,740
 not the way that they treated you,

837
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,260
 but the way God has treated you

838
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,660
 or the way God treats his enemies

839
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,380
 and the message tonight is not just,

840
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,220
 hey, go love like that because outside

841
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,460
 of realizing that inside of that story,

842
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,320
 who you are, that's impossible.

843
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,260
 In other words, in that story,

844
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,660
 you're not called to just go love the Judases in your life

845
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,060
 or be Jesus to the Judases.

846
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,580
 You are Judas and so am I

847
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,980
 and the God of the universe got down on his hands and knees

848
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,780
 and he washed your feet, came to serve

849
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,580
 and he died on a cross for his enemies

850
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,460
 and outside of first encountering that,

851
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,920
 if you leave here and you're like, yeah,

852
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,900
 I'm gonna go just try to love the Judases in my life,

853
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,960
 if you don't realize you are Judas,

854
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,220
 and you don't encounter that God's love

855
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,420
 for you in that moment, despite everything you've ever done,

856
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,660
 every silver that you've ever turned to,

857
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,940
 every pain pill, every pornography

858
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,400
 or pornographic image you've looked at,

859
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,500
 every time that you've slept with that guy or that girl,

860
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,740
 that all of those things that he said,

861
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,140
 I know they're coming and I'm gonna die for you

862
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,460
 and it's encountering that,

863
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,860
 that we're able to both be loved

864
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,900
 and then to give that same love that we received.

865
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,760
 John, who was known as the,

866
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,020
 he called himself the disciple Jesus loved.

867
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,860
 You think about that?

868
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,940
 Like how weird would that be?

869
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,220
 I'm the guy that JP loves.

870
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,260
 He's calling himself, he was so familiar

871
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,500
 and so in belief that Jesus loves me.

872
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 Well, am I driven by the fact of how much I love Jesus?

873
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,780
 No, I'm driven by I'm the one Jesus loves.

874
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,500
 He saw himself that way

875
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,780
 and it would be like all of us

876
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,140
 should see ourselves that way, he would say.

877
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,980
 I mean, if you're reading what John,

878
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,860
 his gospel, in the gospel he says,

879
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,180
 the disciple Jesus loved.

880
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,540
 If you're the other disciples, you're like,

881
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,760
 John, take it easy, buddy, you loved all of us.

882
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,380
 But John's like, he loved me.

883
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,020
 And John would write in his last years,

884
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,220
 you know how we love, you know why we love?

885
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,460
 In 1 John 4, we love because God first loved us.

886
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,600
 That's how we love and that's why we love.

887
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,820
 And God's invitation is not just go love

888
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,580
 the Judas's in your life.

889
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,340
 Realize you are a Judas and he's loved you.

890
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,860
 And in encountering that,

891
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,040
 you'll be able to extend that love to others.

892
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,300
 I think the application in this room,

893
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,780
 like what does it look like to apply this radical

894
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:52,420
 relationship, love driven message?

895
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,260
 For all of us, as we look back in our past,

896
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,580
 there's probably relationships hurt,

897
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,740
 things that were done against you,

898
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,380
 relationships today that are broken,

899
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,580
 parents who walked out,

900
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:10,220
 relationships in dating that just didn't end well,

901
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,500
 mistakes that you made, mistakes that were made against you.

902
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,660
 And I think there's two responses that all of us,

903
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,220
 as we work towards reconciliation, not retaliation,

904
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,480
 as we forgive like we've been forgiven,

905
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,720
 and love like we've been loved,

906
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,120
 the first application is some of you in the room

907
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,100
 need to extend forgiveness to someone who's in your past.

908
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,920
 Maybe there were a parent who hit your mom.

909
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,960
 Maybe they hit you.

910
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,000
 Maybe it was someone you were dating

911
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,800
 and she got pregnant and they went and had an abortion

912
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,400
 and they never involved you in that,

913
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,840
 you still carry pain from it.

914
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,000
 Maybe it's just someone that you thought

915
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,260
 we were definitely getting married.

916
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,600
 They took purity from you and you still carry scars

917
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,160
 and pain when you think about them.

918
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,660
 When you even hear their name.

919
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,000
 That all of us, as we look behind us,

920
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,120
 who are the people that you're still carrying pain,

921
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,720
 that you haven't forgiven, and Jesus's invitation

922
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,460
 is to turn the other cheek, extend forgiveness.

923
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,440
 You may need to leave tonight and go

924
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,400
 and one of the best things you can do

925
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,080
 for many of you who are carrying pain

926
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,320
 that is from past things done against you,

927
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,680
 you were the victim, is to go and get alone

928
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,880
 and begin to work through that forgiveness

929
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,100
 and here's what I mean by that.

930
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,700
 To get alone, to write down the things

931
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,520
 that were hurt, that were taken from you,

932
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,840
 that were stolen from you.

933
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,400
 Anytime there's sin, there's a debt created.

934
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,500
 To write those things down, you took from me this.

935
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,880
 And I'm choosing to forgive you, I'm canceling the debt.

936
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,880
 Like God canceled my debt.

937
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,660
 Despite how much it hurts and despite how hard it is,

938
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,780
 we sit down and begin to work through that pain.

939
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,220
 And the second group is some of you may need

940
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,440
 to just call and ask for forgiveness

941
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,180
 or meet up with and ask for forgiveness.

942
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,500
 Probably the most healthy habit you can now develop

943
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 as you date someone is to begin the process

944
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,220
 of like anytime you think I hurt someone

945
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,860
 or you know you hurt, you call and you say,

946
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,880
 will you forgive me?

947
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,540
 And you very specifically say,

948
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,100
 for hurting you when I did X.

949
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,420
 Maybe you just, you told a girl you were gonna call her back

950
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,260
 and you didn't call and you need to call and say,

951
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,940
 will you please forgive me, that was wrong.

952
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,880
 And I lied to you, will you forgive me?

953
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,300
 Or across the board, things maybe that much,

954
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,180
 at a much deeper level, you need to call and say,

955
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,480
 will you forgive me?

956
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,640
 And ask for forgiveness, seeking reconciliation

957
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,840
 with that other person.

958
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,380
 And as you prepare, I mean, this is like

959
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,980
 the biggest determiner for marriage.

960
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,820
 And because every day there's a hurt.

961
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,060
 My wife and I have conflict only like one time a day.

962
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,460
 And when that happens, it happened today,

963
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
 will you forgive me?

964
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,700
 And as you begin to develop that habit right now,

965
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,300
 so asking forgiveness and extending forgiveness

966
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,520
 or canceling the debt, I'm not gonna hold this against you.

967
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,200
 How do we respond to those who harm us, we forgive.

968
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,680
 How do Christians respond to those who hate them, we love.

969
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:37,600
 Our response is God's response to us, to everyone.

970
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,000
 That's what we're to do, respond in the same way

971
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,960
 that God responded to us.

972
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,960
 I had to do that first step personally,

973
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,080
 a few years back when I was in school

974
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,560
 and I had to just work through the process

975
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,600
 of forgiving someone.

976
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,480
 I realized I was carrying pain from my father.

977
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,880
 And my dad, and just for whatever reason,

978
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,600
 I was at A&M, woo, and I beat you to it.

979
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,480
 And I was there and I just realized I just had some pain,

980
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,240
 I was carrying around from my past.

981
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,760
 My dad, I was raised almost exclusively by a single mother

982
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,820
 and had struggled with alcoholism as long as I know.

983
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,160
 Is to the best of my knowledge, not a believer.

984
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,760
 And he was never around, I have very few memories

985
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,260
 of him being around and the ones I do aren't good.

986
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,760
 Abusive to my mom.

987
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,360
 And I realized there came a day

988
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,080
 where I just had to deal with that, I'd never forgiven him,

989
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,320
 I'd never taken that step.

990
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,680
 And I don't even know that I would've been like,

991
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,760
 yeah, I'm holding a grudge, I'm holding this,

992
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
 I'm not letting it go.

993
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,460
 I think it just, I began to realize I've never forgiven him.

994
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,180
 And I began to sit down and I went and got away

995
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,400
 and I sat down and I began writing

996
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,340
 all the things that he had taken.

997
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,280
 They were sins ultimately against God,

998
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,680
 but as his son, they were hurts or things taken from me

999
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,680
 and I began to write down, you took from me.

1000
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,120
 You took from me a dad who was there.

1001
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,240
 You took from me the chance at a normal childhood.

1002
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,680
 You took from me Monday nights, every other Monday night

1003
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,040
 where I had to drive across town to your terrible apartment

1004
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,920
 because that's what the custody court ordered.

1005
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,580
 You took from me holidays where you were wasted.

1006
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:39,180
 You took from me a chance to see someone love my mom.

1007
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,500
 You took from me the example of a father.

1008
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,920
 And I wrote them all down and at the end of the list,

1009
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,100
 I said, I'm not holding those things against you.

1010
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,140
 I'm canceling the debt like my debt has been canceled.

1011
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,980
 Holding onto these will only hurt me

1012
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,420
 and I'm making the decision,

1013
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,260
 I'm not gonna hold those against you.

1014
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:09,060
 And it wasn't easy, but there was this unbelievable feeling

1015
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,700
 of freedom that came from the God who says, I love you

1016
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,460
 and holding onto these things will only hurt you.

1017
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,380
 I'm inviting you to forgive as you've been forgiven

1018
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,240
 and I didn't do that because I'm a good person, I'm not.

1019
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,580
 I just came to the realization that

1020
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,140
 if what Jesus says is true,

1021
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,100
 if I've really been forgiven like that,

1022
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,240
 how can I not forgive him?

1023
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,460
 And I decided to cancel the debt

1024
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,260
 and some of you may need to do that.

1025
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,980
 Because you're holding onto things

1026
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,620
 inside of your heart from hurts

1027
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,520
 and things wrong that happened to you.

1028
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,260
 I love this message because

1029
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,100
 what if the church got this?

1030
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,580
 Like in Dallas and in Fort Worth,

1031
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,700
 what if like every person in this room really did this?

1032
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,300
 What if they really loved like this?

1033
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,900
 Has there ever been a time in our nation's history

1034
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,120
 in the last maybe few decades,

1035
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,620
 arguably the civil rights era,

1036
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,100
 where hatred was so common or hatred is so common?

1037
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,180
 Bigotry is so common.

1038
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,860
 Racism.

1039
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,500
 There's wounds all over our country

1040
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,140
 and if there was ever a time where people in our nation

1041
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,740
 needed to see a group of people

1042
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,700
 who loved like their father in heaven,

1043
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,660
 who said no matter what you do to me, I'm going to forgive.

1044
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,580
 I'm making that decision like I've been forgiven.

1045
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,720
 And that's how I'm gonna conduct my relationships.

1046
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,400
 Was there ever a time where people so desperately

1047
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,360
 needed to encounter that kind of love?

1048
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,960
 A love more powerful than hate, more powerful than racism,

1049
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,140
 more powerful than the divides of how much money you make

1050
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,440
 or the color of your skin?

1051
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,160
 In the church, we have a chance to do that now

1052
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,440
 and you and I get to do that.

1053
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,720
 And when we do so, individually, it will change your world.

1054
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,280
 It will.

1055
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,440
 And if we do it, it will change this world.

1056
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,100
 If you're not a Christian,

1057
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,820
 this message really isn't for you.

1058
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,380
 But Jesus is and forgiveness is.

1059
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,980
 And as we just work through those pains tonight,

1060
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,520
 if you don't know the God who forgave you,

1061
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,680
 I don't know honestly what to tell you.

1062
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,560
 Because it's only in the shadow of the cross

1063
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
 that I'm able to forgive.

1064
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,680
 Like if I just look in the shadow of my pain against my dad,

1065
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,060
 I'm not able to forgive.

1066
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,480
 But in the shadow of that cross,

1067
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
 all that I'm doing is extending forgiveness

1068
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,400
 like I always extended.

1069
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,280
 And that's what he invites us to.

1070
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,320
 And if you don't know that God,

1071
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,560
 we'd love to invite and talk to you about that.

1072
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,720
 And if you do, we'd love to call and invite you

1073
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,960
 to go extend and ask for forgiveness.

1074
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,400
 I'm gonna pray that we would.

1075
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,400
 Father, thank you that you are the God

1076
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,400
 who washes the feet, metaphorically,

1077
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,880
 of us in the room and actually

1078
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,320
 of those men in that room 2,000 years ago,

1079
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,780
 including one who you knew would betray you.

1080
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,880
 Thank you that you're the God who dies on a cross,

1081
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,900
 who loves your enemies like me

1082
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,100
 and through your love changes us.

1083
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,920
 Would you make us more like our Father in heaven,

1084
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,160
 more like Stephen?

1085
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,680
 I pray for hurts in the room that are deep,

1086
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,680
 even ones that maybe have been offended

1087
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,640
 or felt like I was belittling pain

1088
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,960
 through just things that I said,

1089
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,300
 of calling them to forgive.

1090
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,640
 Would you do what only you can do,

1091
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,280
 move on their heart, move on all of our hearts

1092
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,720
 to seek forgiveness and ask for it where we need to

1093
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,640
 and extend it.

1094
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,680
 And I pray for those who don't know you,

1095
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,000
 that they would experience your forgiveness tonight

1096
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,080
 for the very first time. We love you.

1097
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,720
 We thank you for Jesus, the man of sorrows,

1098
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,800
 acquainted with grief, who died for all of us

1099
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,400
 and gives us new life.

1100
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,680
 In his name we pray, amen.
