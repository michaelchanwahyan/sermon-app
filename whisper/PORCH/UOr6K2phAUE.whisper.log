[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.680]   - Well guys, good evening.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.040]   My name's Harrison Ross.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.520]   I am on staff here at Watermark.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.880]   And recently I have started eating differently.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.580]   Anybody else kind of on this trend of changing what you eat?
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.180]   Yeah, so recently I have cut out gluten and dairy
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.660]   from my entire diet.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.020]   Okay, so some people are celebrating me.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.940]   Other people are judging me and going,
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740]   "You hippie, what is your problem?
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.560]   "Eat a burger."
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.420]   Okay, before, hey, I'm all in on the burger
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.340]   now without a bun and cheese.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.260]   It's terrible.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.900]   But hear me out, okay?
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.140]   Few years ago, I did Whole30.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.820]   I did it kicking and screaming.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.340]   Anybody else on the Whole30 trend?
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.700]   Anybody out there?
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.000]   Anybody on Whole30 right now?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.040]   No, we've all just said, "Screw Whole30, it's terrible."
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340]   So I tried Whole30.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.860]   I hated it.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860]   And then I kind of loved it.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.380]   It really started to change the way I was thinking.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.840]   My wife was already not eating gluten and dairy
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.420]   because of some health stuff.
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.460]   And so it was something that I kind of enjoyed
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.220]   and I quickly bailed from.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.920]   I got to 30, I ran away from it,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.660]   and was like, "This is not for me."
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.780]   But recently, now I'm back because of some other things,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.380]   of how it's affecting clarity of thought,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.380]   other things like that,
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.380]   and partially because I have been haunted my entire life
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.840]   from this picture in high school.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.740]   So this is me.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.640]   I know.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.780]   There's not even judgment.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.920]   There's just shame and sorrow.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.060]   This is me on Easter.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.540]   I'm a ninth grader in high school.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.580]   I have frosted tips that I did unintentionally.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.600]   I'm wearing a rope choker necklace
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.140]   that I think I have a scar indented from
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.180]   because I was so chubby in the neck.
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.900]   And I definitely suffered from what's called moobs,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.360]   man boobs.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.920]   They are real.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.620]   Yes, you shout because you understand.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.180]   This is my life in junior high and high school.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.860]   I was the kid that was deathly afraid
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.620]   to go to the end of the year school party
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.500]   at the masses house 'cause it was a pool party.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.820]   I was that guy.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.480]   I was deathly afraid because of how I looked,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.460]   because I was overweight, because I felt chubby,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.340]   because I had puffy nipples, and I just didn't,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.780]   I did not, I'm serious, I did not want to go
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.660]   and submit myself to this.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500]   And so here I am years later now trying to change
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.900]   what I eat, but I think our society as a whole
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.060]   is obsessed, interested, but really obsessed
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.180]   with losing weight, whether that's changing how we eat
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.980]   through Whole30 or keto, which doesn't work.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.740]   I'll fight you on it.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.060]   It works for a little bit, but so anyways.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.180]   Paleo or getting on the CrossFit trend
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.240]   or going back to your Insanity DVDs
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360]   that you had to dig out of your closet.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240]   He's gonna shred you.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.140]   We are obsessed with trying to lose weight.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.380]   Couple of pounds here and there, a complete life overhaul.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.740]   Because we all know what it's like to have one or two
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.800]   or 50 too many chips when you go to Chewy's.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.320]   And then to down the rest of the queso bowl
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.020]   before the rest of your table can.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.540]   I mean, no one else is going to, so I had to.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.900]   We all have this little extra that we kind of grab
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.560]   here and there and we don't think about
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.220]   and late night Sour Patch Watermelon, man, those get me.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.100]   We kind of grab all these things and hold on
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.260]   and there's the phrase, I have it on a coffee mug
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.660]   that says, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.220]   And I have love handles to prove it.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.800]   And so we all can relate to that.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.140]   We all have weight that we want to get rid of
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.180]   and all of us walked in here tonight
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.140]   with something we're holding on to
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.820]   and a weight that we want to get rid of.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.100]   You're looking at me going, bro, speak for yourself.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.620]   I look amazing.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   I looked at myself today.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.260]   I posted it on Instagram.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.220]   I'm incredible.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.380]   I'm in summer shape.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.340]   But I want you to hear me again.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.540]   Each of us walked in here tonight
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.460]   holding on to something, carrying weight
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.860]   that we want to get rid of.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.420]   And tonight we're gonna talk about how to lose the weight.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.100]   We're not gonna talk about how to lose physical weight.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.200]   We're gonna talk about how to lose soul weight.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.740]   Because most of you, if not all of you,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.320]   walked in here carrying something really heavy,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.260]   a burden, something that's overwhelming you,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.180]   something that's wearing you out, making you tired,
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.220]   maybe even hurting you, depleting you.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.380]   What's soul weight?
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.660]   Soul weight are things from your past, struggles,
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.740]   maybe things that are happening currently.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.660]   For most of us, that's sin.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.780]   For most of us, it's the choices that we make,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.620]   the things that we grab at,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.340]   whether we're thinking about it intentionally
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.340]   or we just kind of aren't thinking about it,
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.420]   and it adds to our soul weight.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.300]   But the soul weight that we carry
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.380]   is not just sin and struggles,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.900]   but it's emotional weight,
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.100]   emotions that well up inside us because of us
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.420]   or because of others, could be disappointments
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.700]   or could be hurts that others have done to us,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.500]   and we hold on to it, we carry it.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.380]   And it then begins to affect all of us,
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.620]   all of our body, not just sticking to our love handles,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.460]   but sticking to our heart and our soul
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.460]   and affecting the rest of the way that we live our life.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.660]   And it's heavy.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.620]   Why do I need to get rid of soul weight?
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.140]   Why do I need to lose the weight?
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.140]   Because the weight that you carry causes guilt and shame,
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.020]   and it affects the way that you look at everything.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.740]   The soul weight that you carry affects the way
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.380]   that you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.180]   It affects the way that you look at others around you,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.860]   and it even affects the way that you look at God.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.780]   What if, just imagine for a second,
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.060]   if you didn't have to carry around the guilt and shame
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.420]   of your sexual sin,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.340]   replaying over and over and over that one night stand
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.900]   or the end of that relationship,
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.460]   laying in bed late at night,
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.540]   replaying that tape or that mistake.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.660]   What would it be like to not have to deal
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.180]   with anxiety anymore?
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.140]   Could you imagine?
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.460]   To not have to deal with that crippling pain in your chest
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.620]   or that nagging, ah!
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.860]   If it could go away, would you wanna get rid of that weight?
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.860]   Or what would your relationships be like
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.380]   if you could fully trust people again
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.540]   and not assume that everyone was always gonna hurt you?
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.540]   What burden did you walk in here carrying?
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.060]   What weight are you holding onto that you need to lose?
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.340]   Not just so that you can feel better about yourself,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.460]   and I want you to hear this clearly,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.580]   and you're gonna hear it throughout.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.420]   Not so that God can love you more,
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.580]   'cause that's not the point,
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.060]   but so you can be free.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.180]   So you can live the life that God intended you
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.060]   so that you could be healthy,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.020]   so that you could be fully who God created you to be.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.940]   God wants to free you of your burdens.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.060]   Jesus said, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.100]   "and take my yoke upon me,
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.500]   "for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.580]   Do you want that?
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.860]   'Cause most of us walk around
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.860]   and we don't feel easy and light.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.300]   We feel burdened from the soul weight that we carry.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.420]   So how do we get rid of the weight?
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.020]   Hebrews 12, one says, "Therefore, since we are surrounded
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.580]   "by so great a cloud of witnesses,
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.580]   "let us also lay aside every weight,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.820]   "every sin which clings so closely right here."
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.020]   (laughs)
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.460]   Right here.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.540]   (laughs)
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.100]   Let us lay aside every weight,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.180]   every sin that clings so closely,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.100]   and let us run with endurance the race set before us.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.860]   Let us be free.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.660]   That's a command.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.660]   Get rid of it.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.340]   Run in freedom.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.700]   So how do we get rid of the weight?
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.860]   Tonight, we're gonna look at how to get rid of the soul weight,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.140]   the ABCs of shedding the weight.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.300]   And the first one is you've gotta admit you have a problem.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.180]   You just gotta first be honest with yourself.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.260]   'Cause here's the problem you have.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.220]   It's sin.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.340]   It is coursing through your veins,
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.340]   and it will wreck your life.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.620]   It will destroy you.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.500]   And it may not be sin that you're carrying,
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.780]   but because of your sin, we wanna hide these things
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.420]   from others, but even from ourselves,
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.900]   we wanna just pretend it's not there,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.620]   or mask it, or control it, or manage it in some way,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.980]   and just think that maybe if we move on, it will go away.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.420]   Because every person in this room struggles with sin.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.500]   "and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.420]   Everybody's on the same playing field.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.980]   First John 1, verse eight, it says,
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.140]   "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.820]   "and the truth is not in us."
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:52.660]   We all have problems.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.860]   For me, the stuff that I'm walking in here,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.620]   just from today, is I wanna stare
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.220]   at every woman that walks by.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.460]   I sat at a coffee shop today,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.620]   just trying to spend time with the Lord,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.980]   and a girl would walk by, and I would see myself
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.900]   wanting to go that way.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.020]   When I say stare, I don't mean just like,
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.300]   oh, oh wow, okay, there's a woman.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.460]   I mean I wanna gawk at, feast on,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.980]   I want to linger long on a woman who's not my wife.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.900]   I wanna run to porn, most days,
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.740]   especially on days where I'm feeling overwhelmed,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.500]   or tired, or stressed, or insignificant and insecure.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.900]   I wanna run back to this safety blanket
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.620]   that I ran to for so long.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.580]   Those are like today, and recently in my life.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.020]   Those are the burdens that I carry every single day.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:55.180]   So we have to admit to ourselves that we have a problem.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.940]   It's as simple as this.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.220]   I like porn.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.700]   Stop trying to make excuses.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.660]   Stop trying to call it something else.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.780]   Be honest and admit it to yourself.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.860]   I like porn.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.620]   I drink a lot, and I hate myself.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.660]   And then I hate myself more,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.180]   so it drives me to drinking continually.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.460]   I hate the way that my body looks.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.460]   I don't like who I am.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.380]   I need to lose that extra 10 pounds
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.380]   that my mom always reminded me to lose all growing up.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.380]   Whatever it is for you, admit that you have a problem.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:38.740]   And some of you who are in here right now,
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.060]   some of you are listening to me,
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.860]   and you're responding the strongest.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.580]   Not in writing notes, but kind of welling up an emotion
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.340]   and just like, oh, come on, man, no.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.060]   No, I don't have a problem.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.700]   You're getting kind of like maybe pissed off at me
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   of calling you out.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.540]   You're like, no, dude, get off me.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.660]   Well, you're who I'm most concerned about.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.980]   'Cause if this was a lose weight message,
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.380]   it's the guys like me who have a high metabolism
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.720]   and think that they can eat whatever they want
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.260]   that are the ones that get diabetes
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.160]   and heart failure later down the road.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.500]   If you think that you don't have something
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.980]   that you're struggling with or you're carrying,
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.780]   then you're gonna exhaust yourself.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.660]   I want you to live in freedom.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.100]   You don't have to carry that anymore.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.900]   God wants to take that from you.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.300]   Because when we carry these things,
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.180]   most of the weight that we carry,
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.940]   a lot of you know, if you have real weight like I did,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.380]   you wanna conceal it.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.140]   You wanna wear the stripes and the plaids.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.700]   We don't wanna show people.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.920]   I didn't wanna go to pool parties.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.700]   And so what we do with our struggles
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.500]   is we just carry it around.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.860]   It's like we're carrying a giant thing of weight
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.020]   all the time.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:05.220]   And if you can't tell from how hard it is to put it on,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.100]   it's heavy.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.420]   We measured it.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.780]   There are 62.5 pounds on this vest.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:22.020]   And on here are the burdens that we carry.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.420]   Some of them are things that I personally carry.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.700]   Some of them represent the things
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.100]   that you may struggle with.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.000]   And again, I want you to hear, this isn't just sin.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.180]   But the weight that we carry, the weight we need to lose,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.180]   the burdens we have could be sin, could be emotions,
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.300]   could be disappointments, or it may be hurt
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.540]   from recent or in the past,
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   that you're just holding onto and carrying for far too long.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.660]   But you don't have to carry it.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.940]   You can see these right now.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.060]   But if I walked out of here the rest of the night,
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.300]   the rest of the week, you'd be like,
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.140]   dude, get that freaking vest off of you.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.460]   That looks exhausting.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.360]   That's the point of tonight's message.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.140]   You gotta admit that you have a problem.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.700]   And then second is bring it into the light.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.560]   Staying in 1 John, 1 John 1, verse nine,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.980]   it says, "If we confess our sins,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.800]   "he is faithful and just to forgive our sins
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.220]   "and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.380]   You don't have to hide it.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.660]   You don't have to conceal it.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.060]   You don't have to manage it.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.280]   You can confess it and be free.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.620]   And God's not gonna look at you and go,
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.620]   ah, why'd you do that?
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.880]   He's not gonna spank you.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.820]   He's not looking to rip you off or to punish you.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.860]   He wants to set you free.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.280]   We have to bring it into the light.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.980]   We've gotta come to him and say,
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.580]   Lord, will you help me with this?
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.220]   But guys, that's not enough to just go,
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.020]   God, take this from me.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.180]   We've gotta take it a step further
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.900]   and bring others into our lives.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.300]   James 5, 16 says, "Therefore, if you confess your sins
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.060]   "to one another and pray for one another,
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.780]   "that you may be healed."
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.200]   God loves you and he wants to set you free,
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.700]   but a part of his provision and healing for you
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.040]   is all around you,
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.060]   is his people who will love you and walk with you
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.540]   and bear your burdens together.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.960]   So guys, to bring it into the light,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.620]   you just have to confess it
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.060]   and watch that weight disappear.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.540]   One of the things that I struggled with for a long time,
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.020]   and you heard I still am tempted towards it, is porn.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.860]   I was addicted to porn for 12 years.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.020]   In high school, there were nights that I could not
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.460]   go to sleep without looking at porn and masturbating,
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.440]   sometimes several times.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.400]   And it wrecked my life all the way into college.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.500]   And I have to confess it.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.740]   And when I do, when I bring that into the light,
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.620]   and for a long time I hid it.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.540]   For a long time, I didn't want anybody to know.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.980]   I thought, I'm this Christian kid
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.140]   that's struggling with this.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.100]   Why do I have to do this?
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.380]   And I bought that lie of, well, God knows.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.380]   I can come to him and he'll set me free.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.940]   And yes, I've got eternity with him
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.420]   because of my belief in Jesus.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.300]   But healing comes when I confess to others.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.980]   And so in college, I finally let these guys in
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.620]   and I got over the fear of what they would think of me.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.540]   I got over the fear of how then I would look or feel
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.300]   if now that they know this about me and I confessed it,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.060]   I brought it into a light and that weight disappears.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.340]   Another one I struggle with is pride.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.460]   I'm full of myself.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.140]   I love people and I'm nice to people,
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.940]   but deep down, I am consumed with me.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.660]   And when I confess that, that weight goes away.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.780]   The struggle doesn't go away,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.620]   but I don't have to hide that and hold onto it anymore.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.700]   I can be free.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.340]   The other thing that I want is I want to be famous.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.260]   I wanna be known.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.580]   I wanna be celebrated and applauded.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.700]   I want people to like me.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.300]   And I've gotta confess that to a room of people
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.580]   who I want to like me.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.420]   And when I do, that burden disappears and it goes away.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.800]   And then I'm crippled with fear, fear of failure,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.260]   fear of the future, fear of what if I'm not good enough?
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.420]   What if I can't produce?
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.140]   What if I can't perform?
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:50.260]   And I can confess that and that weight drops to the ground.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.020]   And then because of those things,
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.620]   I'm riddled with insecurity,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.900]   constantly thinking I'm not good enough.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.060]   I can't match up.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.660]   My gifts aren't good enough.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.820]   I feel small in a room full of people.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.060]   But I can confess and be free.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.620]   Those are some of mine.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.460]   What are some of yours?
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.220]   Maybe, maybe you really struggle with anger.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.900]   Maybe you have these like fits of rage in your house
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.740]   and you try to hide it and you try to make sure
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.300]   that your roommates don't see,
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.540]   but you're just punching the pillow
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.780]   or screaming in your pillow.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.460]   Don't hide it anymore.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.300]   Let some people into your life and be free.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.900]   Maybe you struggle with anxiety.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.500]   Anxiety is not sin.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.980]   And before you think, oh, he's just gonna cut it
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   and it disappears, I want you to hear,
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:48.220]   anxiety and all of these things don't just disappear,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.620]   but you can bring others in so that the burden
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.060]   that you carry alone is no longer on your shoulders
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.340]   and you can walk in freedom as you walk towards healing
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.180]   with Jesus.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.780]   If you struggle with anxiety in any sort of way,
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.740]   and when I mean struggle,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.460]   that that's just constantly in your head,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.260]   man, find somebody and tell them.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.980]   And let that weight be lifted.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.180]   Maybe you're just really into the party scene.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.420]   Whatever drug you can find,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   whatever party you can go to on the weekend
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.980]   to just smash yourself Friday and Saturday night
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.060]   to forget whatever happened throughout the week,
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.420]   and you live in this constant cycle.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.980]   You live this double life.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.100]   Let people in and be free.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.460]   Maybe you're a liar.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.260]   Maybe you just are constantly telling mistruths
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.060]   or close truths, and you're just a chronic liar
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.300]   continually building a story and a fantasy,
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.940]   and it's this game that you play.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.380]   Live in the light.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.780]   Bring it to the light and lose the weight
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.140]   and walk in freedom.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.780]   Maybe you have an eating disorder.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.860]   You try to control your life and control your emotions
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.620]   and control the way you look by what you do.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.620]   You control the way you look by what you eat or don't eat
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.940]   or gagging yourself,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.140]   and it is literally wasting away your body.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.340]   You don't have to anymore.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.060]   You don't have to hide.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.740]   Be free.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.660]   Walk in the light.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.460]   Maybe you struggle with homosexuality
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.140]   and same-sex attraction.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.620]   Maybe nobody knows.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.260]   Maybe you're just deathly afraid to tell somebody.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:37.660]   I would love for you to see people love you,
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.260]   whether it's this or any of the things
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.860]   that are on this vest.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.860]   You can be honest with where you are,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.740]   with where you're tempted, with where you struggle,
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.020]   with where you've been,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:52.140]   and watch that burden disappear.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.420]   Maybe it's sexual sin.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.340]   Maybe it was that one-night stand
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.100]   that you were in the bathroom with your boyfriend
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.060]   and you're like, "I'm not gonna do it again."
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.420]   Maybe it's the fact that you're here.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.500]   Maybe it's you're living with your boyfriend
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.420]   or your girlfriend.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.100]   Maybe you're confused about your sexuality
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.660]   and you're contemplating making a change.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.460]   Whatever that is, bring it in to the light
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.380]   and walk in freedom.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.020]   Maybe you've had an abortion,
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:26.220]   and the weight of that haunts you every day.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.100]   Let people in to love you
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:36.660]   so that we can just help carry that pain with you.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.460]   Maybe you're materialistic.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.260]   You're consumed with what you buy, what you wear.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.100]   I struggle with that.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.980]   I stand in the closet for way too long
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.700]   picking out what it's like.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   Ridiculous.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.820]   But maybe you're just obsessed with buying stuff
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.980]   and continuing this addiction to stuff.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.220]   Maybe you're depressed.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.460]   Maybe it's beyond just anxiety that creeps in here or there.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.060]   Maybe you are consumed.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.660]   You are not just heavy.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.060]   You are depleted.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.300]   You are exhausted.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.500]   And again, this is not something that disappears,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.700]   but bring people into your life
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.980]   so that we can help you shed the soul weight
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.820]   and bring it in to the light.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.780]   Maybe you're suicidal.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.820]   Maybe the burden that you came in here with
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.180]   tonight is going,
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.300]   is tonight the night?
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.500]   Maybe it was last night.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.780]   Maybe it was one time in the past.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.580]   Maybe it's a recurring thought.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.020]   Jesus died so that you don't have to.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.140]   Bring that into the light.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.020]   Confess it.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.700]   Let us walk with you and walk in freedom.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.540]   Then there are other things.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.420]   Maybe you've got an addiction, drugs,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.660]   alcohol, yourself, whatever it is.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.540]   Be honest and be free.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.500]   But there are other things that we carry
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.660]   that can't just be cut off.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.580]   Things that have happened to us
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.380]   could be disappointments, could be hurts.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.900]   Things like divorce.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.020]   Maybe you were divorced.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.260]   Maybe your parents were divorced early on
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.980]   and that really affected your life
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.260]   and the way that you live.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.660]   The way that you have relationships with people.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.220]   The way that you date or don't.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.220]   Maybe somebody in your family got a diagnosis of cancer.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.540]   Or some other terminal illness, or maybe you did.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.260]   And it's heavy and it's hard.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:41.100]   Maybe there was a death in your family recently.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.140]   Death of a friend.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.180]   Death, loss of some kind of someone close to you.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.260]   Maybe you're a single parent.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.100]   My wife and I, a few years ago, we had a miscarriage.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.660]   That was hard for us.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.060]   We didn't know how to carry that.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.460]   It was a weight that I didn't know how to handle.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.740]   The death of my own child.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.580]   Those are things that you can't just be like,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.340]   okay, they're gone.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.980]   But we can still confess them and bring them into light.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.700]   And then maybe there are things
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.100]   that you've tried to just put behind you.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.900]   Maybe there are things that you've tried
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.620]   to just ignore from yourself.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.460]   Hurt that was done to you,
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.460]   that you have just tried to push away.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.460]   Not only from the world, but even from yourself.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.980]   It's not on the front of your chest.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.620]   It's way behind you and buried in your life.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:38.300]   So maybe, maybe you were abandoned
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.820]   early on as a little boy or as a little girl
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.980]   by one of your parents.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.140]   Or by a close friend.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.260]   Or by a boyfriend or girlfriend or fiance.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.420]   Maybe you were abused.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:02.180]   Physically abused, emotionally abused,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.420]   sexually abused by a family member,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.180]   a friend, or someone close to you.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.340]   Those are weights that are heavy.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.620]   Those are weights that we tend to bury
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.900]   deep down inside of us.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.340]   And guys, you don't have to carry that alone.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.620]   Galatians 6.2 says that we are called
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.940]   to bear one another's burdens.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.020]   When we bring these things into the light,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.660]   then others come around us,
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.940]   just as you are coming around me now.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.260]   And through community, we can take those things
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.500]   and we can throw off these weights that hinder us
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.340]   and cast them aside.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.980]   And the weight that we carry that was so heavy
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.860]   and was so burdensome and was so hard,
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   you can be free.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.820]   You can be free tonight.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:57.660]   You can shed that weight, the soul weight,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.580]   that clings so closely as you confess
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.180]   and walk in the light.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.660]   But here's what happens.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.780]   I hope you do that tonight.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.820]   But then we tend to walk away,
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.100]   and I do the same thing.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.620]   We have these things that we've confessed,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.860]   but we wanna then pick the weight up again.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.500]   We wanna pick up that struggle that was,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.940]   and we wanna grab onto it,
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.860]   because it just kinda felt comfortable.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.620]   We know it's bad, but it just feels safe.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.220]   It feels known, even if it hurts us.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.500]   So guys, this isn't a message of just,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.940]   it's not a get it off your chest message.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.260]   It's not just tell somebody once and move on.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.580]   This is something that we have to practice
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.540]   all the time, continually,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:53.660]   so that we can run, as we're called and commanded to do,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.220]   to get rid of the weight.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.700]   So you've gotta admit that you have a problem.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.780]   You've gotta bring it into the light,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.940]   and as you bring it into the light,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.300]   then third, you've gotta continue in community.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.860]   Not just do it once.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.460]   It's not just a one and done,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.860]   but then gather people around you
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.100]   who will love you and walk with you
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.260]   and help you walk in health and freedom in Jesus.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:25.900]   This is not a message of, hey, you've gotta sin less.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.220]   You've gotta do less bad things.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.100]   We just gotta cut out the crap from your life.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.780]   We want you to walk and run with Jesus,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.660]   and to do that, we've gotta continue in community.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   Hebrews 3:13 says, "But exhort one another every day."
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.380]   Another translation says, "Encourage one another every day,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.540]   "as long as it is called to that,
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.540]   "that none of you may be hardened
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.900]   "by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.700]   Not only are these weights heavy that we carry with us,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.740]   we are deceived because we're sinful people,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.900]   and we quickly forget, and we quickly run
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.780]   to these things again and hold onto 'em and run with them,
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.780]   instead of running in freedom and health.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:18.620]   And so we need God's people around us, like Galatians 6:2,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.780]   to bear one another's burdens, to carry them with us,
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.420]   to walk with us, to help us shed that weight,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.740]   because we're gonna want to run back to it.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.100]   For me, recently, I had to come to my community,
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.020]   and I had to confess that I was hashtag chasing on Instagram
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.620]   to try and find something sexy.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.820]   It wasn't just like a, no, no, whoa, that's nice,
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.420]   and then keep going.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.980]   I was intentionally clicking to hope
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.380]   that I'd maybe find something lucky.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.660]   You know what I wanted to do?
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   Hide it, control it, manage it.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.260]   It's not that bad, it's not porn, it's nothing.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.940]   It was one time, I'll move on.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.700]   But then that turns into, well,
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.740]   maybe another time down the road.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.020]   Maybe another time, how about a little longer,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.620]   and then I'm back on the road to addiction.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.860]   'Cause a lot of people in here did Whole30.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.340]   You guys have gone through these 30 days,
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.900]   and you cut everything out of your life,
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.660]   but for most people, when Whole30 ends,
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.380]   so does the dieting process.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.580]   You then just jump back into life.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.260]   That first night you celebrate, and you're at Brahms,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.580]   and you're like, oh, I love this stuff!
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.100]   And you're just taking it all back in,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.540]   and within a couple weeks, you're close to
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.620]   or right back into fitting in the fat genes that you had.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:51.300]   Because we think, we kinda get in these fad diets.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.820]   Confessing sin is not a fad diet.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.820]   This isn't something that we're just calling you
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.060]   to do once or do a little bit.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.900]   But we've gotta do this continually.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.340]   I got to sit with my community,
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.260]   and I got to sit with my wife and just say,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.660]   hey, I need to be honest, here's where I went.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.460]   Because I don't wanna continue down that road.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.140]   I don't wanna carry this burden anymore.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.380]   I wanna choose to walk with Jesus,
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.140]   even when I stray from Him and wanna run from Him.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.100]   I want to run with Jesus,
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.180]   to run the race that is set before me.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.180]   And in our society, most of us lose the physical weight
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:38.420]   so that people will love and accept us,
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.820]   so that we'll look better, we'll look thinner,
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.500]   look cooler, whatever it is,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.980]   or maybe so that we can just stand in the mirror
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.580]   and love and accept ourselves.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:53.900]   But God doesn't call us to lose the spiritual weight
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.900]   or lose this soul weight so that He'll love us more.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.940]   We can lose the weight because of God's love for us.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.380]   We don't have to earn His approval,
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.900]   we don't have to look good for Him,
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.700]   we don't have to look more spiritual,
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.020]   we don't have to look like we have it all together.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.380]   He wants us to be free.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.300]   We read Hebrews 12 together at the beginning.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.980]   I'm gonna reread verse one,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.900]   and then I wanna give the key to that.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.100]   And then I wanna give the key verse of verse two.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.700]   If you've never heard this verse,
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.380]   or if you're looking for a verse to memorize,
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.860]   this is one to put in your head
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.300]   or to put in the dashboard of your car,
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.540]   to write on your mirror,
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.100]   or to make the home screen of your phone
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.500]   so that you don't forget.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.540]   Here's what it says.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   "Therefore, since we are surrounded
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.580]   "by so great a cloud of witnesses,
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.000]   "let us also lay aside every weight and sin
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.860]   "which clings so closely right here."
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.420]   Lay it aside, get rid of it,
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.500]   and run with endurance the race
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.560]   that is set before us looking to Jesus.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.000]   Not looking to your own perfection,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.740]   not looking to what you can do,
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.820]   not looking to your own goodness,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.380]   to your own spirituality,
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.540]   to your own, wow, look how great I am at confessing sin.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.200]   This is nothing that you do,
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.580]   it is all what God's gonna do in and through you
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.460]   by the power of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.980]   As you lay this aside, looking to Jesus,
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.180]   the founder and the perfecter of our faith
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.580]   who for the joy that was set before him,
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.100]   endured the cross, despising the shame,
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.500]   and he is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.740]   God came down to this earth
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.580]   to bear the burdens that we all carry,
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.100]   to live a life that we live,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.300]   to walk as a man, Jesus came,
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.400]   and he lived it perfectly.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.780]   And then what it says that he did
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.340]   is he went to the cross for us
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.340]   to carry all of this junk that we've carried for so long.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.700]   And he took it upon himself
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.440]   knowing that we would choose this,
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.340]   knowing that we'd run to our addiction,
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.140]   knowing that we'd run to our pride,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.500]   knowing that we'd run to our self-righteousness
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   or self-loathing, and he said,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.020]   "I will carry it for you."
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.580]   The shame that we feel,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.460]   the shame that we're holding onto,
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.260]   the weight that clings so closely,
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.920]   he said, "I despise that shame.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   "I will put it on myself so that you can be free."
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.480]   All you have to do is look to me.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.260]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.080]   and I will give you rest.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.160]   Rest for your souls.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.500]   Rest for eternity as we live forever with him
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.060]   for those who believe in him,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.560]   but today you can be free.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.620]   If you're in here and you don't know Jesus,
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.300]   you need to know that God is crazy about you.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.780]   All this junk that I carry and we carry,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.940]   God doesn't look down on you and look at you with pity
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.500]   or sorrow or shame or disappointment.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.920]   He looks at you and he loves you.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:29.940]   So he calls us to throw these things aside,
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.000]   to not try to fix our own weight,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.860]   to not try to get all this stuff
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.180]   and try to carry it on our own,
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.880]   but to throw it aside and to look to Jesus.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.880]   Who endured the cross for us,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   who rose again from the grave to give us life
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.960]   so that you could have life.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.280]   Get rid of the weight.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.880]   Get rid of the soul weight that you're holding onto.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.340]   There's no easier time than tonight.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.440]   Don't make the excuse of, "Well, I'm not ready,"
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   or maybe two weeks from now.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.320]   Find somebody tonight.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.240]   And if you're not in community, then come find one of us.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.160]   We'd love to help you find people
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.440]   that can come around you and love you
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.620]   so that you can be free because Jesus loves you.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.520]   And he died for you to set you free.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.440]   Heavenly Father, thank you.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.520]   Thank you that you love me in spite of my crap.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   That 2,000 years ago, while I was still a sinner,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.080]   before I had committed any sin,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.000]   before I thought of any sin, before I was even born,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.480]   you loved me, you chose me, you died for me.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.920]   Thank you, Lord, that I don't have to come
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.520]   and get cleaned up and fixed up and look prettier
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.960]   and look more spiritual to come to you.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.640]   I can come in my brokenness.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.320]   We can come in our brokenness and fall before you
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.960]   and find life in you.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.520]   Jesus, will you help search our hearts,
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.000]   know our anxious thoughts,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.520]   see if there is any grievous way in me
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.200]   and lead us in the way everlasting.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.080]   Expose our junk, Lord, and give us courage
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.200]   to bring it into the light so that we can be free.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.700]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
