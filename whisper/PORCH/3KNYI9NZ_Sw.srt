 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 >> All right, all right, all right, Parch! How we doing? So good to be back this Tuesday night.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 You already heard from me once. I'll be quick. But first and foremost, man, thanks for being here.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We're so glad you would choose to be in this room with us. And special shout out to our Porch Live locations,

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 tuning in from all over the nation. Give it up for Porch Live, everybody, please, one more time.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Porch Live, Tulsa, Scottsdale, Midlands, special shout out to you guys.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Okay, I'm going to get out of the way very quickly because I'm very excited about what we have in store for tonight.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 We have a really, we have really the privilege of listening to what I would consider to be one of the best Bible teachers I know.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But more than that, somebody that I would consider to be the genuine article, goals when it comes to walking with God.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And I'm not just trying to hype him up so you'll listen. I think he can more than take care of himself.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We have a good friend in the room named Drew Worsham here tonight. Would you all just help me say hi to Drew?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 It's great. Porch, here's what I want you to know about Drew real fast.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 He's an illusionist. He's an executive coach. He's a pastor, speaker, Bible teacher.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 He's got a long list of things on his resume. But the thing that I love most about Drew is,

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 every time I spend with him, he just sets the pace for me very personally of what it looks like to walk with Jesus.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The way he talks about God is the way that I want to talk about God.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 The way that he cares for people is the way that I want to care for people.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And so we really do have such a gift in him being here with us tonight.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And I'm excited for where he's leading us over the course of the next few minutes together.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 But without further ado, would you all do a great job of helping me welcome Drew Worsham to the stage?

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 How are you guys doing? Good? Okay. Still waking up. I love it.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Well, like Kylan said, my name's Drew. I live in San Antonio, Texas, which is, you've heard of it.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Yeah. Small city south of here. And I feel so honored to get to be just a small part of what God's doing tonight.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I love Kylan deeply, believe in just his leadership and his heart.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 There's very few men that I meet that are as passionate about the name of Jesus and who have such a heart for me.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And not even just the porch, but for Dallas, the metroplex area, like for people to fall in love with Jesus.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And so I'm so, and Kylan, love you, grateful as like, gosh, seven, eight years ago that we met.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And it's been cool to watch you from College Station to Houston and now here in Dallas.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And so my wife and I love you and Brooke so much and so grateful to be a part of this.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I love Watermark Church. I mean, one of my favorite people is one of your pastors and TA.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And so, and I say this sincerely, last week we were here and my wife and I had these really deep conversations of like,

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 if we were to ever move to Dallas, not saying we would, but if we were,

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I think the number one reason right now would be to be a part of a church like Watermark and what God is doing in this space and with the porch.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And so when I say it, I mean it. We love you dearly.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So Kyla mentioned that along with being a pastor for the last 20 years,

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I've traveled and toured as a professional magician or illusionist for the Christians that are here tonight.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It's usually a joke. We'll see. So here I thought, listen, there's really,

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 the moment you tell people that everybody's like, prove it. And so I was like, OK, we'll do something real quick if you're down with that.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And so, sir, what's your name? What is it? John. Would you take this package?

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I want you to hold on to this. Guard it with your life. OK.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 If anyone around you tries to mess with it, you just karate chop them.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And then if for any reason, John, you need to go and use the restroom in the next five minutes, just don't.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 OK, here's what we've got. If you have a cell phone, I'd love for you to pull it out tonight,

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 because what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to manipulate someone's mind using satellites that you're going to control.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So here's what I want you to do. I want you in just a second.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 You're going to go to your contact list, address book, whatever it's called on your device.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And I want you to scroll through there and you're going to pick someone, your choice.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You can pick anyone that you want to, someone that's specific to you.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 But I would encourage you pick someone that if you were to place maybe a phone call to them tonight,

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 you think that they may answer the phone. Got it. So you can start kind of making your way.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And here's how this is going to work. This game, all of you get a chance to play.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 In a moment, when I tell you to, not before, but the moment that I tell you to, what you're going to do is this.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You're going to place a call to that person. OK, not yet, not yet.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The moment that you place the call and you can hear the phone ringing,

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 what I want you to do is I want you to stand up where you are. OK, and then this is crazy.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Here's what gets intense. The moment that you have someone on the other line, like a real person, like a robot.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 OK, like there's a real person on the other line. You're going to do two things simultaneously.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Here's what you're going to do. First off, you're going to do whatever you can to keep them on the phone,

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 while at the same time trying to get my attention. Got it.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Here's the reason that's important is because tonight we're actually going to use one of you.

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 We'll use the very first person to get the person on the phone. Go and place that call right now.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The moment it's ringing, you're going to stand up. The moment you have someone on the other line,

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 make some noise, do a dance, whatever. You guys help me out. Oh, oh, oh.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I saw you jump up. You got somebody on the other line. You got this blue thing.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Yeah, that's you. Yes. OK, OK, OK. Are they still on there?

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 You still got to come on up. Come on up, ma'am. Right here with the glasses.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yes. The rest of you. The rest of you. Go ahead and hang up. Hang up. Hang up. Hang up. Hang up.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Come on up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can just hang up. Yes. Come on up, ma'am.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Pause right here. OK, do me a huge favor. Do me a huge favor.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 If you haven't already, hang up. And then secondarily, if you would, make sure that you put your phone on silent,

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 because every person that you just called is about to call you back. OK, so tell me your name.

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Your name. Mia. Mia. OK, Mia. Tell me, who do you have on the other line?

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 My cousin. Your cousin. OK, where is your cousin right now?

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Do I ask her? Yeah, sure. Where are you at?

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Does she live in DFW? No, in the colony. The colony. Is that in the metro?

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Yeah. OK, OK. So she's like close. She's not like in another state.

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 No. OK. And what's your cousin's name? Emily. Emily. What's her last name?

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Flores. OK, here's what we're going to do. Miss Flores or Emily, what I want you to do is first tell Emily to stay on the phone.

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 You can take it off speaker. I want this to be as fair as possible. OK, you may want to so you can hear.

80
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Yeah. Tell her that this conversation is about to get very, very strange.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Yes. And if you haven't already, tell her you're safe. OK, perfect.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Here's what we're going to do. I want you to tell your cousin just to go with us.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 This is going to be strange, but I want in her mind to imagine a deck of playing cards.

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It's so weird. OK. And I want you to tell her with all those cards spread out in front of her to imagine reaching in there and grabbing one card.

85
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 OK, imagine them spread out and then imagine just grabbing one card.

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 OK, now here's the deal. People have a tendency to pick easy ones like an ace or king.

87
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 OK, if she picked one of those or the queen of hearts, tell her to put it back.

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 OK, put it back if you pick that. Which one? Like an ace or a king.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She did. No. Did you pick that one? No.

90
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 She picked the queen of hearts. The queen of hearts, of course. Yeah, it's hard to put it back. I know. I know.

91
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It happens every time. Now pick a different one. Pick a hard one. There's no way that I'd be able to guess.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 She got it? So in her mind, she should be able to see the value of the card and the suit.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Like the number in the suit. Does she have both of those?

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Yes. I'm going to take a step back. I can't hear. But if you would, for the first time, I want you to have her tell you the name of the card.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So now you know it. Perfect.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I want you to tell Emily that you love her so much. You're so grateful that she answered the phone.

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And that in just a little bit, what you're going to do is when we're all this is done, OK, we're done tonight at the porch.

98
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 You're going to call her back and you're going to explain everything that happened up here on stage.

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And when you do that, it's going to blow her mind. Tell her all those things.

100
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's going to blow her mind. Perfect. You can hang up. I love it.

101
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Perfect. I love it. It's great. OK, here's what we're going to do. This is crazy.

102
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Everyone tonight had opportunity to call whoever they wanted to.

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 There's no way possible that I could have predicted out of everyone in here that you would be the first person to call.

104
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 They get somebody on the phone and that of all the people in your contact list that you would call your cousin, Emily.

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 OK, now this is crazy. And that she just thought of a playing card, put it back and then changed her mind for the first time out loud.

106
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Would you please tell us what was the card that your cousin Emily selected?

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 What was it? Five diamonds. The five of diamonds. That's exactly right.

108
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 If you guys would give a round of applause. Well done. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 That would be horrible. No, I'm here impressed that easily. Just wait. Five of diamonds.

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 OK, all of you had this choice. You called Emily. She selected a card, put it back and then landed on the five of diamonds.

111
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 John, you've been holding on to that package the entire time. I want you to look at me.

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Look at me. Be very honest. If tonight we opened up that package and inside of it was a large deck of playing cards.

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 If we were to pull out all those cards, go through there, there was one, one single card that was flipped over in the deck.

114
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And it happened to be Emily's card, the five of diamonds. Be honest. Look right here at me. Would that impress you?

115
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Yes. It would impress me, too. But we got to check it out. So I tell you what, if you would, ma'am, would you please walk to the edge of the stage?

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 John, would you please walk up here? Would you give them both? Oh, right here. Give them a huge round of applause.

117
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Well done. Give it to her. Oh, I love it. Come here.

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 OK, would you please open up this package? Oh, my gosh, I'm so nervous.

119
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Open it up. Open it up. Take your time. We have all night.

120
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 OK. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. OK. OK.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 What was the card? Five of diamonds. She just thought of a card. She's in Las Colinas. Where is it?

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The colonies. Who knows? She's not here. That's all that matters. Oh, my gosh. We're going to do this so, so slow.

123
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Oh, would you please hold this deck? Oh, my goodness. We're going to go through these cards very slow.

124
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 They're large. There's no sleight of hand that can happen. In just a second, you're going to see one car that looks a little different than all the other cards.

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Would you please tell me when you see it? It should be really, really obvious.

126
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Tell me when you see it. You see it. It's a big red one. Good eye.

127
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 OK. Here. Oh, my goodness. Once again, every single person tonight had free opportunity to call whoever they wanted to.

128
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You just happened to be the first person to get someone on the other line.

129
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Out of all the people you called, you called your cousin Emily. She picked the queen of hearts and changed her mind to once again.

130
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 What card? The five of diamonds. The only card in this entire deck flipped over is the five of diamonds.

131
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 If you guys would, would you give her a huge round of applause? Well done, ma'am. You can have a seat.

132
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Oh, yes. OK. I don't even know how that one works.

133
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Here's here's what's really strange tonight. Tonight, there's really this was there's no stooges.

134
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's there's no sleight of hand. It's just literally this happens in the moment.

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 But as I flew in this afternoon, I tell you what, if you still have your phones out, would you go to Instagram?

136
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Once again, ma'am, what's what's Emily's last name? What was it? Flores? Flores. Emily Flores.

137
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 If you would go to Instagram and if you wouldn't mind, I'd love for you to just type in my name.

138
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It's just Drew D-R-E-W-W-O-R-S-H-A-M. Drew like worship, but with an A-M.

139
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 If you click on my profile, what I want you to go is go to the bio and then can you pull that out here?

140
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Would you you got it? Would you, Kylan, can you turn your mic on? Would you read what my bio says?

141
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I wrote this literally on the flight here. Can you can you read that out loud?

142
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Here it is. Here it is. For those of you who can't see it. Read it out loud, Kylan.

143
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Tonight, I have a feeling that a young woman with initials E-F will answer a phone call and think of the playing card, the five of diamonds.

144
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 If you guys would, once again, would you give this young lady a huge round of applause? John as well.

145
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Thanks, Kylan. Yes.

146
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Tada. Oh, well, cool.

147
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Hey, let me let me do one more one more thing, if you don't mind.

148
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Because everywhere I go, this is the question that I get asked and many of you will ask immediately when we're done.

149
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Drew, how?

150
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And I'll be honest with you, the moment that the secret is revealed for a trick like that or any other trick, it's like the balloon pops.

151
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 The magic literally leaves the room.

152
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But occasionally there's these moments where the way the trick works is so cool that it's actually to me more impressive than the trick itself.

153
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Like the psychology, the method. And so if it's cool with you, can I show you how to do a trick?

154
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So are you down with this? I know I'm breaking all the rules.

155
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 OK, this is a real simple. It's real quick. You'll be able to do this from here on out.

156
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'm going to show you what it looks like and then we'll go from there.

157
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Cool. So here's here's here's the trick.

158
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I've got this domino here and I'll try to move slow, but this is important.

159
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The domino has a single dot on this side, which is cool.

160
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But on the backside of this domino, it's got four dots.

161
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 OK, on the other side of the domino, there's three dots and on the other side, there's six dots.

162
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 You got it. I'll try to do a little bit faster. There's one dot on this side. There's four dots on this side.

163
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 There's three dots on this side. There's six dots on this side. Got it.

164
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Now I'll show you how it works. This is so cool. So random.

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 That works. Kind of neat, right?

166
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 This is if you're curious. Yeah. OK. There's some of your piece in this together.

167
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The way the trick works is this. So if I take my hand and I place it over this dot,

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 what happens is your brain fills in the gaps and goes, oh, it's a domino with one single dot.

169
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Why? Because you've seen a domino that looks like this. You have never seen a domino that looks like this.

170
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So if I do this, there's one dot. Or if I do this, your brain actually fills in the gaps and puts the third dot there.

171
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It's fascinating. The same is here. You've got six dots or here it becomes four dots.

172
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Now, here's what's really, really interesting. Here's the reason I kind of I do this for us tonight is because.

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 You're more likely to be fooled by something like that, the more educated that you are.

174
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Let me explain. Your brain creates shortcuts when it sees things like this.

175
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So all of a sudden it sees this. It's got to like just conserve energy.

176
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's got to kind of just kind of implant that. OK, that's a single dot moving on.

177
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 There's a lot more information that we're receiving. And so it just kind of fills in the gap.

178
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And so the more educated, the more experienced, the more likely that you are able to be fooled by that.

179
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Who's not fooled by that is little kids. They're like, I bet there's two dots.

180
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 They're just putting his hand over one. And here's the reason that I even bring this up tonight.

181
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 It's just a moment. We're going to dive into the scripture.

182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And I believe that God has something in store for each and every one of us in this space.

183
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Like on a personal note that Jesus wants to lean in, to pull the chair up close to you,

184
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 go knee to knee and speak to your heart in a language that's special to you.

185
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And my fear is that we dive into this scripture and what I believe God wants to show us tonight.

186
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Is that the longer that you've been in the church. Or the longer you've been a Christian.

187
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The more acclimated you are with how we do all of this.

188
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Or maybe the more accustomed that you are to the story of Jesus.

189
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I think it makes it harder for us to actually see what Jesus is going to invite us into tonight.

190
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And my fear is that it would be right in front of us.

191
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 How the trick works. The presence of God.

192
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And he would invite us into deeper waters than we've ever experienced.

193
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And we miss it. Because we've been here before.

194
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 We're inoculated to it.

195
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's like we've got just a flu shot.

196
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Just enough of Jesus where it doesn't affect us anymore.

197
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So tonight I want to pray for us.

198
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And then we're going to dive into the text.

199
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Jesus, I desperately need you in this moment.

200
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 There are no words. There's no preparation.

201
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 There's no magic trick or jokes or illustrations.

202
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That can actually change a heart.

203
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 But Jesus, your words and your spirit can do just that.

204
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And so Father, tonight would you open up the ears of our heart or the eyes of our heart to really see you.

205
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Father, we feel the invitation into deeper waters than maybe we've ever felt before.

206
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And maybe, just maybe, we would walk out of this room completely changed and different because we met with you.

207
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Remind us of our identity.

208
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Remind us tonight just how much you love us.

209
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Let's hear you pray.

210
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Amen.

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Well, on August 5th of 2010, a copper mine in San Jose, Chile, caved in,

212
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 leaving 33 Chilean miners trapped 2,300 feet below the earth's surface.

213
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And search and rescue teams began to drill down to see if anyone had survived and maybe found their way to a rescue shelter.

214
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 In 17 days, two and a half weeks into the search and rescue,

215
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 one of the drill bits that went down, it came out and written in bright red color were these words,

216
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "We are well in the shelter," signed the 33.

217
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And immediately countries across the world began to leverage all their resources and technology to try to figure out how to save these 33 men,

218
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 including the USA and our very own NASA.

219
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And then 69 days after being trapped, all 33 miners made their way to the surface one at a time.

220
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And over the course of the next few months, these men found themselves on news channels, late night shows,

221
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 like Jimmy Fallon, telling their story of how they survived.

222
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But slowly, we begin to lose interest and we went back to our lives

223
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 and they tried to do the same.

224
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And one year after their rescue, Time Magazine went to check on the miners and to see how they were doing.

225
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And a few were doing, we'd maybe say, okay.

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 But most of them had major issues.

227
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 One of them, the day before, like Time Magazine arrived, had just been arrested for domestic violence.

228
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Almost all of them were wrestling with sleep issues, panic and anxiety disorders, PTSD.

229
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Some were dealing with drug and alcohol abuse.

230
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Some started hoarding food and choosing to sleep on the hard floor instead of their mattress.

231
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 One miner that they went to interview, they found him literally building a wall around his house.

232
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And when they asked him, "Why are you doing this?"

233
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 His response was, "I have no idea."

234
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Which led Time Magazine to write an article entitled, "Do the Miners Need a Second Rescue?"

235
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 "Do the Miners Need a Second Rescue?"

236
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Why?

237
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Because here's the deal.

238
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They were free.

239
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But they weren't really free.

240
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They were free.

241
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 They weren't in the mine shaft anymore.

242
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But they weren't free.

243
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And the reason that I even open up with that illustration is because this.

244
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I believe for so many people, especially in the West, in the Western church, many of us as followers of Jesus know what it's like to live forgiven.

245
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 But very few of us know what it looks like to live free.

246
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Sure.

247
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Our hands and our ankles, wrists and ankles don't have chains.

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But our hearts are far, far from free.

249
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And I believe that there is a spirit of orphan, a spirit of slavery that has invaded our country, our nation, our churches, and even the hearts of our leaders.

250
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And whether it's a scarcity mindset, people pleasing, approval seeking, applause chasing, performance anxiety, worry, fear, stress, all of it comes from this spirit of slavery or orphan.

251
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And can I be honest with you, church?

252
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It's not freedom.

253
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 It's not freedom.

254
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And listen, I just want to be really honest with you today.

255
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 If wherever you find yourself in the spiritual journey, there's these moments where we pick up maybe God's word and we look at Jesus's words and we look at these really crazy promises that he makes.

256
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Like John 10 10, where Jesus goes, hey, hey, you know what?

257
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I came to give you life and to give it to the fullest.

258
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Or Jesus in Matthew 11, what makes these days ago, hey, are you tired?

259
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Hey, come to me.

260
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I'll give you rest.

261
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I'll show you how to live in the unhurried rhythms of grace.

262
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And we hear those verses and there's this part of our heart, if we're honest, where it's like maybe, maybe those are cute metaphors.

263
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Maybe, maybe Jesus, maybe he's talking about after we die.

264
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But if we're honest, like life and life to the fullest rest for our souls.

265
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Freedom.

266
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 It is for freedom's sake that you have been set free and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

267
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And we kind of just want to call BS.

268
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Or maybe it doesn't work for me.

269
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And tonight I want to invite you into what God has been showing me about what the secret of actually living in freedom looks like.

270
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 If you guys are cool with that.

271
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And if you have a copy of your scripture, I'd love for you to turn with me to Luke chapter 15.

272
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Luke chapter 15 and before we dive into what it looks like to start to walk in freedom.

273
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 What I want to do is I want to give you three lies from the scripture.

274
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And I'll just go ahead and I love this.

275
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 If, if man, if you're into reading God's word, these three lies and the story that we're about to kind of show you in the motif of scripture, you're about to see it everywhere from this moment forward.

276
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And we're looking tonight at these three lies and we're going to look at it at a story that Jesus told that he tells in a trilogy.

277
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 He tells these three back to back stories.

278
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And the first story, Jesus tells this story about this lost sheep and how this shepherd leaves 99 sheep and he goes and he grabs the one and he brings it home.

279
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And then Jesus rolls into the next story where he goes, hey, there's this woman who has these coins and she loses one and then she tears the house apart.

280
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And then she finally finds this coin and immediately she invites all of her friends over and they throw this like fat daddy party to celebrate the fact that she lost this one coin and she found it.

281
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And then Jesus shifts and he tells this very popular story that maybe you've heard of about this lost son, the prodigal son story.

282
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And so I just kind of recap and I want to kind of show you some key pieces of the story.

283
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 But Jesus tells this story about a younger son who looks at his dad and essentially says this, hey, dad, I wish you were dead.

284
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I want, I want my inheritance.

285
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I want what's coming to me and I can't wait any longer.

286
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 So would you just give me what's mine?

287
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And the father gives him his inheritance and the scripture says that he goes into the big city and he immediately begins to live it up.

288
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Partying, we'll find out later that he's like wasting his money on parties and prostitutes.

289
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And he gets to a point where he loses everything.

290
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 And he's just like man, scrape and bite where he's got to get a job like feeding pigs.

291
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And Jesus tells the story that there's a point where he's so hungry that he's like, man, even the foods the pigs are eating look good to me.

292
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And so he, scripture says he comes to his senses and he's like, what am I doing?

293
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Like even the servants, even the slaves in my dad's house, they're way better off than me.

294
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Now, listen, I'll never be a son again.

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I've lost that privilege.

296
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So what I'll do is I'll just head home and I'll just tell my father that I'm sorry.

297
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And maybe just maybe he'll give me a job.

298
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 So the scripture says that he's on his way home and he's practicing the speech.

299
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 He's like, man, God, I mean, father, I totally blew it against God and you and I just I don't deserve to be a son.

300
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Just make me a slave.

301
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And he's practicing this speech.

302
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And the scripture says that the father, while he's a long ways off, sees him and begins to run to him, which was so undignified.

303
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Men did not run in this day and age.

304
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And he begins to run, wraps his arms around his son, and his son starts to go over that rehearsed apology.

305
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And the dad doesn't even hear it.

306
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 He just kind of cuts him off and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

307
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 My son, who was once dead, is now alive.

308
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 He was lost and now he's found.

309
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Kill the fattened calf and buy coldplay.

310
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Let's throw a huge party.

311
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And then we meet the older brother.

312
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Who the whole time is just out in the field and gets frustrated and refuses to go to the party because of the special attention that his brother's getting.

313
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And then the story just ends.

314
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And tonight, what I want you to see is that this story is about two sons.

315
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 They both carried a spirit of slavery or maybe orphan on them.

316
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And both look biological by position.

317
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 They're sons, but both acted like orphans.

318
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Both acted like slaves.

319
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 One through rebellion, one through religion.

320
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And both almost missed out on the very inheritance that God was trying to give his kids.

321
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So I want you to see tonight three lies that you and I are prone to hear and to receive that would allow us to walk in a spirit of orphan.

322
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I want to encourage you tonight.

323
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I have a feeling there will be one of these that speaks just a little bit louder to you.

324
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 As you hear it, I'd ask you to maybe sit with it for a moment.

325
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I'd like to go, "Hey, why does that one seem to kind of have my email address?"

326
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And it just may be that the spirit of God may speak to your heart and start to invite you into more freedom.

327
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But it's going to start when we first have to realize what lie we're believing.

328
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So I'm going to kind of give you all three of them, and then you just kind of see which one maybe sits with you.

329
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Got it?

330
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 So here we go.

331
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 We'll dive into the story.

332
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Lie number one, if you're taking notes, is this.

333
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Lie number one is that you'll never have enough.

334
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 If you're a spirit of orphan or spirit of slave, this lie circles around your mind.

335
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 You'll never have enough.

336
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 I'll tell you how it plays out.

337
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Verse 17, the younger brother looks and says, "When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare?'"

338
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And then here I am.

339
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I'm starving to death.

340
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I don't have enough.

341
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 I'm acting like an orphan.

342
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Or the older brother, later on in verse 29, he looks at his father.

343
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 When his father comes out to plead with him, beg him to come celebrate the fact that his brother who was lost is now found, is dead, and now he's alive, come celebrate.

344
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And the way he says it to his dad is, "Look, this whole time I've been working for you, and you never gave me even a young goat that I could celebrate with my friends.

345
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 You never gave me a goat.

346
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Father, you've been holding out on me.

347
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 You don't take care of me.

348
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I've got to take care of myself."

349
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And it's the spirit of orphan that lands on both sons.

350
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 You'll never have enough is the first lie.

351
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Now, this is how it may play out for you and I.

352
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 That in the back of your mind, you feel like you'll never have maybe enough money.

353
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You'll never have enough friends.

354
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Enough resources.

355
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Enough time.

356
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Energy.

357
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And even, oof, there's this part of you that goes, "God, have you forgotten me?

358
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 How much longer will I be single?

359
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 God, are you going to actually put someone in my path, or am I going to have to do this myself?"

360
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 I know it's a little close to home, but like these are indicators that there's a spirit of orphan slave that begins to creep into our heart.

361
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 It's a scarcity mindset that leads us to worry.

362
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 It leads us to anxiety, to fear.

363
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And it's not freedom.

364
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It's a spirit of slavery, of orphan.

365
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Let me give you a quick example.

366
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 If your family, or you know someone who's maybe adopted a young child,

367
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 or maybe that was a part of your upbringing,

368
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 you can watch that there's this young child that goes from not having, you know, maybe parents,

369
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 or parents that are fit.

370
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And then legally, there's a moment, they stand before the judge that this child moves from what the state considers an orphan,

371
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 now into being a child of these two parents.

372
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Like that's now mom, and that's now dad.

373
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 The court sees it, the state sees it, the mom and dad see it.

374
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And that child now has access to everything that is that family's.

375
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So they get to sit at a table,

376
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 where full access to everything that's placed, every meal that's placed on that table.

377
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 What's interesting is in almost every case a child is adopted, legally,

378
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 they'll still have full access to everything on the table,

379
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and they still find themselves hoarding food.

380
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 They'll find themselves with a little drawer in their room where they stash snacks.

381
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Why?

382
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Because even though they're legally adopted,

383
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 there's still an orphan spirit that rests on them.

384
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 My daughter Tilly, who's five years old,

385
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I think we have a picture of her, yeah there she is.

386
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Tilly is gosh so fun.

387
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And if you were to ever like, if you come to San Antonio,

388
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 and you want to like visit, and you come to the house,

389
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 and you want to play with Tilly, and whether it's bubbles, or fruit snacks,

390
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 like she's just so hospitable, and she like finds out there's something that you like,

391
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 she's like quick to be like, "Oh my gosh, you want some fruit snacks?

392
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 I can give you more fruit snacks."

393
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Like whatever you want, just take them.

394
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And you're like, "It could be her, like maybe like her Easter candy."

395
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And she's like, "Yeah, you can have some, you can have some."

396
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 And we noticed like a couple of weeks ago,

397
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 is that she'll find herself, like if you come over and you're playing with Barbies,

398
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 and she feels like you're having a really good time,

399
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 then it's almost every time she will give you the Barbie,

400
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 and say, "You can take this one home, it's yours."

401
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And so, we had kind of a little, had to have a conversation.

402
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Where we're like, "Hey Tilly, listen, fruit snacks, give them away.

403
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 You just throw them.

404
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Barbies, they're expensive.

405
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 So we're going to hold on to those, cool?"

406
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 The true story, my daughter looked at me,

407
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 and she said, "But daddy, you can always get me more Barbies."

408
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 But this is where it hit me.

409
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 My daughter knows that she has a dad who loves her deeply.

410
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 A dad who's always going to take care of her.

411
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And she's not wrong, she can give away all of her Barbies,

412
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and go, "Dad, I want some new Barbies."

413
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 And we'll go, "Yes, get in the car, we're going right now."

414
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Because she's got a dad that loves her, and will always take care of her.

415
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Like never, not one time will I let her go without.

416
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 And so the question is, is that how you and I walk through life?

417
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Do you realize that when you claim to know and to love Jesus,

418
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 yes, you've been adopted into the family.

419
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 But more than just that title shift,

420
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 you have a father who loves you deeply and dearly.

421
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And he knows every single one of your needs and your desires,

422
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and your wants, and he looks at you and he goes,

423
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 "I'm going to take care of you."

424
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 You don't have to kind of hoard,

425
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 you don't have to play with this scarcity mindset.

426
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 You can take your life with an open hand and go,

427
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 "Yeah, I can give it all away."

428
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Why?

429
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Because I have a really good father.

430
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 And he will always, always take care of me.

431
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 It may not be in my timing.

432
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 It may not be when I want it.

433
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 I thought I'd be further in that job by now.

434
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 I thought I'd be married by now.

435
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 I thought I'd have kids by now.

436
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 That you have a good father who sees you

437
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 and goes, "I'm not holding out."

438
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 But so many of us, we don't live like that.

439
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 We still live as orphans.

440
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Maybe that's not your lie.

441
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Maybe it's not the first one, maybe it's the second one.

442
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 First one is you'll never have enough.

443
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 The second lie that orphans believe

444
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 is that you'll never be enough.

445
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 You'll never be enough.

446
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Verse 19, younger brother, that's how it plays out.

447
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 He looks and he says, "Hey, I'm..."

448
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 He looks at his father, he goes, "I'm no longer worthy.

449
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 "I'm not worthy to be called your son.

450
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 "Just make me a hired servant."

451
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Like that's an identity statement.

452
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 The older brother looks at his dad and says,

453
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 "Hey, but when this son of yours came home."

454
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Once again, he's just like his younger brother,

455
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 just a different factor.

456
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 He's distancing himself from the relationship of the father.

457
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 He's distancing himself from being a son.

458
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 It's a being question, I'll never be enough.

459
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And the way this plays out for you and I in real time,

460
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 it's fear of abandonment.

461
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 It's people pleasing.

462
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 It's addiction to approval, attention, affirmation.

463
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 It's walking through life with a deep seated shame

464
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 or toxic shame.

465
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 If you struggle with a lack of boundaries,

466
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 it's not sonship.

467
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 It's not freedom.

468
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 It's a spirit of slavery or orphan.

469
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And the root of this lie, I mean, a lot of them are,

470
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 but this one specifically is a shame.

471
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And I want you to see this, this is really deep.

472
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 I'm about to give you just my counseling notes,

473
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 my own journey.

474
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 This is free, you didn't pay for it.

475
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 So the root of this lie is shame.

476
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 And when we, shame always pushes us into hiding.

477
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 That goes all the way to page three of the book.

478
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 We hide and when we hide with shame,

479
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 there's only two outcomes.

480
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 We either become a victim or we become a hero.

481
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 It's the only two options when we're walking in shame.

482
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 Okay.

483
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 So this is going to step on some toes,

484
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 but maybe this is where we get invited into freedom.

485
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Okay.

486
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 If we find ourselves walking as a victim and you can,

487
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 listen, you, you know it, you feel it.

488
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 You've got the friends around you where immediately when people

489
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 go, Hey, how's your day?

490
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And you just immediately rattle off all the hard things that

491
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 happen.

492
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Well, I got struck in traffic and now it's 10 minutes late.

493
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 And then this happened and this happened and they didn't have my

494
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 favorite coffee drink.

495
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And you're like, Ooh.

496
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 And it's not just because you had one hard day.

497
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 It's like, that's your like default dialect.

498
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Oh, then that orphan spirit is heavy on you.

499
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 That victim that's never going, or just like always complaining.

500
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 That's one side.

501
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Ooh, here's the side that sadly gets celebrated.

502
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 It's the hero.

503
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 The shame all of a sudden creeps into our story and we have to be

504
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 the hero of the story.

505
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 So guys, we find ourselves constantly dating the damsel in distress.

506
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Why?

507
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Because we have deep seated shame issues and we believe that will

508
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 never be enough.

509
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 And so we think that maybe if we save you,

510
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 that will somehow validate our existence.

511
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Once again, anyway, it's not the topic.

512
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 But I'll just give you a quick example.

513
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 We have to be the hero.

514
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 We have to step in.

515
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 That's why that people pleasing kind of creeps in and all of a

516
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 sudden like it plays itself out in so many ways.

517
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 I'll just give you, I'll listen.

518
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Let me fly it up to 30,000 feet.

519
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 So it's not so sensitive.

520
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 In 2012, a brilliant film, dark night rises.

521
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Okay.

522
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Batman, Christian Bale.

523
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 So good.

524
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 So, so good.

525
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 There's this particular scene in the movie where Bruce Wayne goes

526
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 to this masked gala and everyone has like a mask on and except

527
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Bruce Wayne.

528
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And he finds himself dancing with Anne Hathaway,

529
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Catwoman.

530
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 And she poses this question.

531
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 This is the scene here.

532
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 She poses this question.

533
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 She says, you're the only one without a mask.

534
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Who are you supposed to be?

535
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 And his response is I'm Bruce Wayne, a centric billionaire.

536
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Now this scene gets lost on many of us,

537
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 but it was incredibly important to the director,

538
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 Christopher Nolan.

539
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 And here's why he was trying to communicate in a small moment that

540
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 because of Bruce's childhood trauma and deep seated shame,

541
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 that Bruce actually considers Batman his true identity and that Bruce

542
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 Wayne is just the mask that he wears to the public.

543
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Oh, it's so good.

544
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Let me take it a little step further.

545
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Christopher Nolan says that meaning for Bruce Wayne,

546
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 the true self, the true being,

547
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 the only person that was actually worthy of the love that he never got

548
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 from his parents because they were murdered.

549
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 He's an orphan, so he's an orphan spirit.

550
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Okay.

551
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Is the person hiding behind a mask all alone,

552
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 trying to prove that he's more than human.

553
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And it's performative and it's not love.

554
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 And the root of this lie is shame and it creates a distance between us

555
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 and the father.

556
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 And it doesn't lead us to freedom.

557
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 The lie that we'll never be enough.

558
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 So maybe it's you never have enough.

559
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 Maybe it's never be enough.

560
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Or maybe it's the third lie that you'll never do enough.

561
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 You'll never do enough.

562
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 This is a younger brother who looks at his father and he goes,

563
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.

564
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 So just make me a hired servant.

565
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Here's the younger brother's rationale.

566
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Hey, listen, I have totally blown it.

567
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 Like there's no way possible that I could ever earn my way back into the family.

568
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 But just maybe, maybe I could get a job.

569
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 And maybe I could do enough.

570
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 Then maybe you would love me again.

571
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 So if I could do more, maybe then you would approve of me, God.

572
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 The younger brother at the end of the story looks at his father and this is what he says.

573
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 He says, look, this whole time,

574
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 this whole time I've been slaving for you.

575
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 Not one time did I disobey an order.

576
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Like how interesting is it, his language here?

577
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Like he's not even like, like trying to hide the fact that he's got this like spirit of slave and orphan that's on him.

578
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 The whole time I've been working so hard for you.

579
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 I've been slaving back here.

580
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Not one time did I get it wrong.

581
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 And you've been holding on to me.

582
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 It's like no matter what I do, it's never enough to you, is it God?

583
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Like what do I got to do?

584
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And both of these sons believe the lie that they'll never do enough.

585
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 And for us, this plays out in validation junkies, addicted to comparison.

586
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 It's performance anxiety.

587
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 It's the imposter syndrome.

588
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 It's this trap that we get in and constantly trying to prove our worth by what we do.

589
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 We quickly find ourselves introducing ourselves and immediately telling people what we do for a living.

590
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 As though somehow maybe that would validate our existence.

591
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Oof, can I bring it close?

592
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 Some of us believe this lie so much that we'll spend way more money than we actually have

593
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 to buy clothes that we do not need or really fancy cars that are way beyond what are actually practical.

594
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 Why?

595
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Because when we get inside of the car, we put that jacket on, there's a moment where we feel validated

596
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 and the spirit of orphan and slave just doesn't speak as loud as it normally does.

597
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 So we medicate for a second.

598
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 This is deep.

599
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 But once again, it's like the magic trick.

600
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 The longer you've been walking in this, the harder it is for many of us to see it.

601
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 I'll maybe give you one more quick example.

602
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 If your day or your mood is affected, okay, you feel the shift by criticism.

603
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 The amount of likes that you got on that social media post.

604
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Someone not recognizing or validating your hard work.

605
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 Or, none of you in this room would struggle with this, but people back in San Antonio sometimes do.

606
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 Or, if you feel like your standings with God are dependent on your Bible reading consistency,

607
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 your attendance at church or the porch, or your management of sins.

608
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 If you feel like God's view of you is somehow shifted or gets better based upon how well you play the Christian game,

609
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 how moral you are, how well you read the scripture, how often you show up,

610
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 how you are able to somehow manage your morality.

611
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 It is the spirit of slave.

612
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 And you're believing the lie that you'll never do enough.

613
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Oh, gosh.

614
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Because the truth is, hopefully you know this, Christianity is not about what you and I can do.

615
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 It's about what Jesus has already done.

616
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Like so many of us, we have this mindset that Christianity is like this giant list of do's and don'ts.

617
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 And that's why we feel like maybe we're doing well.

618
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 I'm following the list. I'm doing things well.

619
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 I'm staying away from the don'ts and I'm doing the do's.

620
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 And God, I guess, is going to be somehow pleased with me. He's happy, right?

621
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 And we find ourselves jumping through all of these religious hoops.

622
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 And can I just free some of you tonight?

623
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 That that's not what the journey towards Jesus is about.

624
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 It's about the moment that we actually come face to face with Jesus.

625
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 When we actually bask underneath the waterfall of his grace and his mercy and his love.

626
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 And yeah, yeah, well, look at those things.

627
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 Yeah, I don't want to do those things. I don't want to be a part of those things.

628
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 But those things don't matter. Why?

629
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Because I'm your son.

630
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 And I'll walk away from whatever it takes to get more of you, Jesus.

631
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 Not in order to earn your favor, but because I'm already loved and cherished by you.

632
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 You and I, listen, weren't just set free from a spirit of slavery or orphan.

633
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 We were set free to something.

634
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 We were set free into a spirit of sonship.

635
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 This is huge. Don't miss it, please.

636
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 From this moment forward, my prayer tonight has been that you can't not see this everywhere.

637
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 But I'll give you a few.

638
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 Romans 8.

639
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 Scripture says this in verse 15, "For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear."

640
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 It's one of the lies.

641
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 "Instead, you receive the spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"

642
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 "The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit that we are God's children."

643
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 I love it. You go back.

644
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 I don't have time for this, but just look at the Father's response.

645
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
 Actually, we do have time. I'll just share this really quick.

646
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 I love that this Father's response in those last few verses of the chapter is he speaks against the lies.

647
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 So this whole idea, like, I'll never do enough.

648
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 He looks, he says this, he's like, "Wait, what do you mean?

649
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 Like, what do you mean?

650
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 Like, I'll never have enough. I'll never be enough."

651
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 The Father looks at him and says, "My son."

652
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 Immediately speaks into his identity, the being.

653
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 Then he looks at you, "You'll never have enough? Like, what do you mean?

654
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 I'll never do enough? You were always with me."

655
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 "But I'll never have enough. What are you talking about?

656
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 Everything I have is yours."

657
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 Or, listen, Paul picks up again in Galatians 4.

658
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 So good.

659
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 "But when the time was just right,

660
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
 God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

661
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 to redeem those under the law that we might receive adoption to sonship.

662
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 And because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,

663
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 the Spirit who calls out, 'Abba, Father.'"

664
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Verse 7, "You are no longer a slave.

665
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 You are God's child.

666
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 And since you are his child, God has made you also an heir."

667
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 The story of Scripture is that you and I, listen, on page 3 of the book,

668
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 watch this. You ready for me?

669
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 Blow your mind.

670
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 Page 3 of the book, the enemy shows up and he really, he poses three lies.

671
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 And he guesses what those three lies are.

672
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 He looks at Eve and he says, "Hey, you're never going to have enough.

673
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 God's holding out on you."

674
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 He said, "Oh, eat of all the fruit," but there's one that he didn't.

675
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 He's holding out on you.

676
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 "Oh, you feel like your being's broken, right?

677
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 But if you had this knowledge, oh, then, then you'd be fixed.

678
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 And not only that, then you'd be able to do what God can do."

679
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 And they believe that lie and the spirit of orphan came crashing into our planet,

680
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 broke everything that we know.

681
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
 And the whole Old Testament, although it's filled with a bunch of wild stories,

682
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 watch this, please don't miss this, okay?

683
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 It's really just one giant promise.

684
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 And the promise is this, that God sees you and I and all of our brokenness

685
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
 in our orphan spirit, and one day, he's sending a hero to fix every bit of it.

686
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 So when he turned the pages from Malachi to Matthew,

687
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
 the Old Testament and the New Testament, the hero shows up.

688
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 But it's not what any one of us expected, because the hero is actually God himself.

689
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 Jesus steps out of heaven, wraps himself in human flesh,

690
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 teaching you and I, as we walked on earth for 33 perfect years,

691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 what it means to be fully human and to be fully alive.

692
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 You know what's really interesting?

693
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 What's the title that the God man, the God who put on flesh, chose to wear?

694
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 What's his part in the Trinity?

695
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 What's it called?

696
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
 Son.

697
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
 Have you ever stepped back and be like, "Why son?

698
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 It's not biology.

699
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 Jesus isn't Hercules.

700
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 He's not a demigod.

701
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 He was the God who put on flesh and moved into our trailer park.

702
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
 Why bear the title of son?

703
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 To show us what our inheritance looks like.

704
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 To show us what our new identity looks like as sons.

705
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 And what's crazy is there's so much.

706
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 I'll just give you a couple more.

707
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 Jesus, I think this is important for you.

708
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
 Jesus, he gets baptized right before he starts his earthly ministry.

709
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 Scripture says that he goes into the water, he comes out,

710
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 and all of a sudden the sky opens up, the father's voice speaks,

711
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 as there's a dove that descends and kind of the symbol of the spirit.

712
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 And the father's voice says something really interesting.

713
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 He says this.

714
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 That one?

715
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 That, that's my boy.

716
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 And I am madly in love with him.

717
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 And I'm super proud of him.

718
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 What?

719
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 What are you proud of?

720
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Jesus hasn't done any of the things that we celebrate.

721
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 He hasn't walked on water, hasn't healed anybody, hasn't turned water to wine,

722
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 hasn't cast out demons, hasn't healed the sick, or called the dead out of the grave.

723
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 He hasn't gone to the cross.

724
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 What's the father proud of?

725
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 He's proud of him no matter what he does, because he's his.

726
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 These are the words that are spoken over you and I as we get adopted into the family.

727
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 They combat all three of those lies.

728
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
 Oh, you think you'll never like have enough?

729
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 You think you'll never be enough?

730
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
 You think you'll never do enough?

731
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 Well, guess what?

732
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 You're mine.

733
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 And I deeply love you.

734
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
 You're mine.

735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 I'm a good dad.

736
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 And you don't have to do another thing.

737
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 I'm already wildly proud of you.

738
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Jesus from that moment gets led into the desert where he faces those three lies yet again.

739
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 Hey, Jesus, you'll never have enough.

740
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
 Stones right here, all you got to do is turn them into bread.

741
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 Jesus, you're never going to be enough.

742
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 So why don't you throw yourself off of this temple called the angels?

743
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 They'll grab you and then guess what?

744
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 You'll get to be the savior that everyone wants you to be,

745
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 instead of the misunderstood Messiah that you've been called to be.

746
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 Jesus, you're never going to do enough.

747
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 So why don't you just bow right now and I'll just give you the kingdom.

748
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 You really think the cross will be enough?

749
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 It won't.

750
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 So just bow, I'll give it to you.

751
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 And Jesus is able to combat all three lies in the spirit of orphan because he's the son.

752
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 And he's able to walk in this deep levels of freedom.

753
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
 So tonight, let me just kind of maybe share one more thing.

754
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 The million dollar question is how?

755
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
 Cool, true, you expose the lies.

756
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 Now what the heck do we do?

757
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
 How do we actually start to walk in the spirit of sonship?

758
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 I want to tell you this real quick.

759
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 This is important.

760
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 The spirit of slave or orphan, whatever this is, cannot,

761
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
 it's the only spirit that I'm learning.

762
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 And I didn't grow up in a charismatic home,

763
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 but it's the only spirit that cannot be revoked or abused.

764
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 It's a spirit that has to be replaced.

765
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 And it can only be replaced by the spirit of sonship.

766
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 I want you to hear me.

767
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
 So how do we get that?

768
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:29,000
 The only way that we start to walk with the spirit of sonship is by proximity to the father.

769
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 That's it.

770
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 I'd love to be able to give you an app, a pill, Whole30 diet plan.

771
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
 I don't know, like 75 hard.

772
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 Like I wish there was some type of thing that I could give you that would somehow fix.

773
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
 But here's what I'm learning.

774
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 Is that the only thing that works is actually proximity to the father is what makes us actually become sons.

775
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 That's it.

776
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 And sadly, in the Western church, the reason this spirit is so rampant,

777
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 that's because very few of us know how to just be with the father.

778
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 Can I give you a quick example?

779
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 Many of you, when I said that,

780
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 immediately created a to-do list of what you're going to do tomorrow a little bit different.

781
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 And immediately believing line number three,

782
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 maybe I could do more.

783
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 So maybe the question for you is what would it actually look like to just learn to sit,

784
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 to be, to turn your phone off, to close your mouth.

785
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 It is so difficult in our day and age.

786
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 And it's why the spirit I believe is so thick in our churches.

787
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 I started with this cheesy little domino trick.

788
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
 What's interesting about the domino is like I told you that it's just psychology.

789
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
 It's just a trick.

790
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 But what's really cool is at first, once again, this is for a lot of us, this is Christianity.

791
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
 Oh, that's kind of neat. That's cool how that works.

792
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
 And it just kind of wears off from like, yeah, we're all used to two dot a domino. No big deal.

793
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
 But as we get closer,

794
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 my prayer for you is that you would start to realize

795
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 that the presence of Jesus is more real than the chair you are seated in tonight.

796
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 And many of you start to experience and sit in his presence.

797
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 You're going to start to see things that you never saw before.

798
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
 Many of you walk out here and you're like, wait, question was it two? Was it three? Was it four? Was it five?

799
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
 I don't know how many dots, but some of you will swear up and down that you really did see six dots.

800
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 Like you're like, no, no, no. I don't know what you saw.

801
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 Maybe it was all in your head, but I really did see six dots.

802
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
 And then some of you are going to walk out and be like, well, what about the other side?

803
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 Would you see two? Do you see three? I felt like he started off with that.

804
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
 And you'd be like, no, no, I promise I saw three dots.

805
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 It was the weirdest thing. I don't know if that's you.

806
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 And here's what's really wild.

807
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
 As some of you tonight, as you get step in and a little bit closer to Jesus,

808
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
 as you begin to walk in the freedom that he offers,

809
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 and my prayer and my hope is that you'll go, there's so much more than I ever thought possible.

810
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 Because Jesus just keeps, keeps getting better and deeper.

811
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 And so tonight, here's how I want to end. Here's how I want to end our time.

812
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
 If you're cool with it, my invitation application for you is this week.

813
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 What does it look like for you to actually learn to just sit with the father and to receive your identity as a son,

814
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 so you can learn to walk in real freedom.

815
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 So tonight, listen, if you're okay with it, here's how I would like to end my time.

816
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 I want to speak a blessing over you, a father's blessing.

817
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 So if you would, I invite you to stand wherever you are.

818
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 You can take whatever posture tonight that's comfortable for you.

819
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 You can stand, you close your eyes, you can open your hand, whatever, whatever is, is fitting for you.

820
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:47,000
 And tonight, just give me 60 more seconds. Don't miss this.

821
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Many of you like myself, never received a blessing from your father.

822
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 Maybe most of your life, it's been just a lot of course, like curses.

823
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 And it's why you walk in this orphan spirit.

824
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 And so tonight, not from me, but on behalf of our heavenly father, I just want to speak a blessing over you.

825
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:23,000
 And my prayer is that wherever you find yourself in a spiritual journey, that you would receive it.

826
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 So tonight, to the college student, to the young professional, to the single, to the solo parent, to the religious, to the skeptic.

827
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 You are my child. You're mine.

828
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 Like, and I love you and I'm proud of you and I'm pleased with you.

829
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 And tonight I release you from all performance and trying to like somehow earn my love or try to earn a sense of belonging with me.

830
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 Or to maybe earn my pride over you.

831
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 Even if you were to never do any of those things ever again, those three truths will always be true.

832
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 I love you. You're mine. And I'm proud of you.

833
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 I see you and I know you.

834
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 I desire to be with you. I want you to abide with me.

835
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 I love time with you. I care about what you're feeling.

836
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 I care about what you're thinking. I value your dreams and your wants and your desires.

837
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 I want, I want to talk to you about them.

838
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 I see your heart to really know and to really love me.

839
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 I see your heart and aptitude to really love your friends and family, to engage them and to make them feel valuable.

840
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 And seeing, I see many of you fighting to let me be the father that you never had or the friend that you never had.

841
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:09,000
 And I want to teach you and I want to be with you in all of these areas.

842
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 I am the dad that you long for.

843
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
 I love you, son.

844
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
 I love you, daughter.

845
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:35,000
