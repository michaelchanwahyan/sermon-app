1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,720
 - All right, all right, welcome to the porch.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,040
 My name is Josiah and we are jumping into week three

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,020
 of Ephesians, introducing the new you.

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,860
 But before we get there, help me welcome our friends

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,880
 across the nation, our Porch Live locations,

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,960
 Porch Live Tulsa, Oklahoma, Boise, Idaho,

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,240
 Scottsdale, Arizona, and not but least,

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,920
 or was that right?

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,380
 Yeah, yeah, not but least, our friends right down the road,

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,960
 Fort Worth, Texas, come on, the Porch Live.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,800
 Let's go.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,720
 (audience applauding)

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,760
 Love it.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
 Well, hey, any iPhone users in the room tonight?

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
 (audience cheering)

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,160
 Okay, all right, me too.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,440
 Any Android?

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,700
 (audience cheering)

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,960
 You can be dismissed.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,240
 I'm playing, I'm playing.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 Is that one Android user on the group text

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,440
 that you can't name the texting thread, you know, that one?

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,540
 You know, you got to use group me instead?

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,480
 Oh man, Android people, got to love them.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,780
 Hey, 15 years ago, about two and a half months ago,

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,640
 15 years ago, so two, excuse me, two months ago,

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,360
 we celebrated 15 years of this thing right here,

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,440
 the iPhone.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,400
 The iPhone came out.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,920
 I know you probably didn't know that, that's okay.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
 A man named Steve Jobs had a vision, yeah, look at it,

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,320
 had a vision that he would create a phone

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,480
 that would change everything,

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,900
 almost everything about our life.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,040
 Like, it was crazy, like, I got to thinking,

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,980
 man, I was 24 years old, I know I just dated myself there.

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,560
 I was 24 years old in 2007 when the iPhone came out.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,140
 And I just got to thinking, man,

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,140
 he used this one phone that began to change our culture.

41
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,700
 It began to change the way we communicate,

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,340
 the way we interact, and ultimately,

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,340
 he created this phone to change the world.

44
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,420
 Let me give you a few.

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,540
 It was the first modern touchscreen smartphone.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,280
 It allowed us to basically carry a computer around

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,860
 that fit in the size of our hand.

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,140
 That's what he created,

49
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,620
 the first modern touchscreen smartphone.

50
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,100
 It put internet in our pockets,

51
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,160
 whether you have, you know, wifi or not,

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,300
 like, you have the internet at your disposal.

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,060
 We're connected all the time.

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,940
 Everything is now instant gratification.

55
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,380
 We now expect everything to be on demand.

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,540
 We take for granted that we have unlimited music

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,040
 and TV shows and movies and books on our phone.

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,020
 It turned all of us into wannabe photographers

59
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,540
 and influencers, right, man?

60
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,820
 It gave us platforms.

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
 Some of you really are influencers, praise God.

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,560
 Hopefully you're influencing the right thing.

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,660
 It transformed photography from a hobby to,

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,020
 man, there's not a day that goes by

65
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,820
 that you and I probably don't take a picture of something.

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,140
 I mean, we sit across the table with friends

67
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,020
 and we have fajitas and we wouldn't,

68
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,100
 it would never cross our mind 15 years ago

69
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,860
 to take a picture and share that with the world.

70
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,940
 We would just talk to each other, right?

71
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,040
 But we don't really do that anymore.

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,080
 The iPhone gave way to apps.

73
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,940
 Now there is more than two million apps in the App Store.

74
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,100
 It shaped modern social media.

75
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,320
 For a great part of my life,

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,940
 I would have to log on MySpace, anybody?

77
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,060
 Ooh, oh, a few, okay, older generation,

78
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,980
 let's go, millennials.

79
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,020
 Facebook, we'd have to log on from our computer.

80
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,580
 Now we just get to log on to social media from our phone.

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,280
 Yeah, come on.

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,880
 You can FaceTime with anyone around the world.

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,700
 There's navigation on your phone now.

84
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,900
 Like, this'll blow your mind.

85
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,300
 There was a thing called Maps.

86
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,900
 Like, it was a paper deal that you had

87
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
 that you would fold up or unfold,

88
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,480
 but you would put it in your glove box.

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,620
 Like, some of you are like, what?

90
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
 That's just crazy.

91
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,820
 I don't, really?

92
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
 Yeah.

93
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,720
 On top of that, like, it was 500 bucks when it came out.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,540
 Like, that was unheard of.

95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,500
 Like, I said, no, man, this isn't gonna get any traction.

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,340
 There's no way.

97
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,580
 Like, you can get the Razr or the BlackBerry,

98
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,260
 just sign a contract and it's almost free.

99
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,660
 And now we just drop one grand.

100
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,660
 You know, we just drop $1,000 on, you know, getting the phone.

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,900
 I start there tonight because in the same way,

102
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,180
 the iPhone and this one man, Steve Jobs,

103
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,500
 changed the world.

104
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,580
 It changed how we interact with each other.

105
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,940
 It changed how we spend our time.

106
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,540
 Like, the average person spends eight hours a day

107
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,020
 on their phone, which I'm not promoting, right?

108
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,720
 I'm just saying it changed everything.

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,060
 The way we talk.

110
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,380
 And tonight, like, we're gonna look at a passage

111
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,180
 in scripture, I believe it's one of the most powerful

112
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,800
 passages in all of the Bible.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,680
 In Ephesians chapter two, tonight, that I believe

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,620
 has the power to change everything in our life.

115
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,280
 And for some of you, it has.

116
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,060
 Like, it's changed the way you live.

117
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,400
 It's changed the way you talk.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
 It's changed the way you date.

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,700
 It's changed the way you spend money.

120
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,520
 It changes the way you work.

121
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,100
 Like, it's changed the way you even use your time.

122
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,380
 In this passage, it paints the clearest depiction

123
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,320
 of the gospel, who is Jesus and what did he come to do.

124
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
 The gospel has the potential to change everything about us.

125
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,460
 And for some of us tonight, like, we don't believe this.

126
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,140
 Like, we don't believe this message

127
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,700
 and that's why some of us are gonna spend eternity

128
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,060
 apart from Jesus, separated from him forever and ever.

129
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,220
 In a place called hell.

130
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,900
 And that's sobering for some of us.

131
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,540
 But if you believe this, then it changes everything

132
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,100
 about your life.

133
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,300
 Ephesians two, starting in verse one.

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,100
 If you have your Bibles, you can turn them

135
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,220
 to Ephesians chapter two.

136
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
 It'll be up on the screen if you don't.

137
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,800
 We're gonna see who we were before Christ,

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,240
 what Christ has done and who we are now.

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
 Ephesians two.

140
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,660
 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins

141
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,140
 in which you once walked.

142
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,420
 Following the course of the world,

143
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,500
 following the prince of the power of the air,

144
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,300
 the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.

145
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,060
 Among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,

146
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,460
 carrying out the desires of the body and the mind.

147
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,340
 And we're by nature children of wrath

148
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,260
 like the rest of mankind.

149
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,100
 Point number one.

150
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,940
 Point number one, this is who we were.

151
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,220
 Who we were.

152
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,900
 We were dead, the Bible says.

153
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,060
 Not physical, but spiritual.

154
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,360
 Like we're separated from God.

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
 Why?

156
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,020
 Because of sin.

157
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,120
 Like dead in our trespasses and sins means

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,860
 that sin is not just an action,

159
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,840
 but it's a condition of our heart.

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,460
 Like sin isn't just something we do.

161
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,180
 Sin is something we are.

162
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,960
 And that's hard for some of us because we like

163
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,740
 just believing that this is just something we do.

164
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,180
 Because if it's just something that we do,

165
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,280
 then we can just pull our bootstraps up

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,680
 and white knuckle this thing and change our behavior

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,200
 and modify it and go to the self-help section

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
 at Barnes and Noble and just get some self-help books

169
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,300
 to help us build a better you.

170
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,460
 But we see that we're not sinners because we sin,

171
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,440
 we sin because we are sinners.

172
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,180
 It's in our nature, this text is saying.

173
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,120
 Dead in our trespasses and sins.

174
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,300
 Think about it like this one.

175
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,320
 This way, the iPhone, for example,

176
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,000
 or any phone, you plug it in.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
 I told you I had an iPhone, come on.

178
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,720
 You plug it in and it's charged up.

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,540
 You do that the night before like I do

180
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,780
 and then it's charged up for the day,

181
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,980
 but it only lives for so long and then what happens?

182
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,720
 It dies.

183
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,840
 It dies and this is like you and I,

184
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,200
 we're not independent beings,

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,240
 we're dependent beings on the God of creation,

186
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,360
 the one who's pumping breath into your lungs,

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,200
 is giving you a heart that beats and eyes that see.

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,860
 We're not independent from him,

189
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,160
 we are dependent on him.

190
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,920
 And when we sin against him,

191
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,120
 it's as if we're unplugging from the source of life

192
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,880
 and the results are we're still alive,

193
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
 but we're in this cycle of death now

194
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
 and eventually we're gonna be disconnected

195
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,940
 from the source of life completely.

196
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,400
 This is how the Bible explains our deadness.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
 This is how the Bible explains our life.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 We can be living physically but dead spiritually.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,760
 And in the process of dying physically,

200
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,840
 you stand before God and then you experience eternal death

201
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,120
 which is forever punishment away from God,

202
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,820
 separated from the grace of God

203
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,480
 instead of being connected to the grace of God.

204
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,880
 And listen, I warn you because I love you.

205
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,620
 Like this isn't a popular message of our day,

206
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,720
 but maybe God brought you into this place tonight

207
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,280
 to hear this message that could change everything

208
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,520
 about your life.

209
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,680
 The text explains why we're dead.

210
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,680
 It says we're dead because we're following the world.

211
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,640
 It goes on, it says we're following the course

212
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,920
 of this world and think of the world

213
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,080
 or think of culture as like this fast moving river.

214
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,200
 It's this strong current and has this deep undertow.

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,080
 And anything that goes into the river

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
 just gets swept downstream.

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,640
 The Bible's saying that this is the culture,

218
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,280
 this is the world that when you jump in

219
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,760
 and you begin to follow the world,

220
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,080
 then it's just gonna take you down that path

221
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
 that the world goes down.

222
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,920
 That, you know, hey, that's just how they think.

223
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,960
 Or that's just what they do.

224
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,400
 That's just, you know, how everyone acts

225
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,200
 and you just start seeing it as normal.

226
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,560
 And it's because what everyone else is doing

227
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,440
 and you just date like everyone else dates,

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
 you spend like everyone else spends.

229
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
 And in fact, the Bible says that there's a way

230
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 that seems right to man, but there's not.

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
 It seems right to man, but that way ends in death.

232
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
 And so tonight we gotta get some altitude,

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
 we gotta get some perspective and understand

234
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
 that we're all born in that river

235
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,320
 and we're all headed downstream.

236
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,880
 And for some of us, like we know what this feels like.

237
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 For some of us that we've committed our life to Christ,

238
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,480
 our life is marked by a difficult swim

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,280
 against that strong current of the world and culture.

240
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
 Like some of you know what I'm talking about.

241
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,000
 Like it's easier for you to sleep around

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,720
 than it is to put your sexual desires in check

243
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,480
 and protect your purity for your future husband

244
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
 or your wife.

245
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
 Like it's easier for you to spend all your money

246
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,240
 on yourself instead of spending it on others

247
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,480
 and furthering God's kingdom.

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,840
 Like it's easier for you to numb the pain of singleness

249
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,360
 by running to a two-dimensional image on your phone

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,240
 just to get a quick release rather than,

251
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,960
 man, get up from that place and pursue that woman.

252
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,200
 But you think, man, but I got rejected the last time

253
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,240
 or the last four times I went out on dates,

254
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,640
 it didn't work out.

255
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,960
 But that's not an excuse to keep pursuing

256
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,200
 a woman and being God's man.

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,480
 For some of you, the pain of hurt, the pain of suffering,

258
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,960
 it's easier for you just to numb it with the bottle,

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,320
 just run to alcohol instead of extending forgiveness

260
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
 for that person who hurts you.

261
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
 It's easier for you just to have a corrupt sexuality

262
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,880
 or correct morality than it is to repent

263
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,640
 and seek the Lord and grow by the grace of God.

264
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:27,080
 It's easier for you to build a platform on social media

265
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
 than to build God's kingdom.

266
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,280
 This is why the Bible says we're dead,

267
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,920
 because we're following the course of the world.

268
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,120
 It doesn't just say we're following the course of the world

269
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,040
 but it says we're following Satan,

270
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,680
 following the prince of the power of the air,

271
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,360
 the spirit that is now at work and the sons of disobedience.

272
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,960
 Not only are there God's people but there's Satan's people.

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,360
 Not only are there people that are submitted

274
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,380
 to the work of the Holy Spirit

275
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,760
 but there's also people that are submitted

276
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
 to Satan and his demons.

277
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
 And so the question begs is,

278
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,760
 hey, how do you know if you're submitted to Satan?

279
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
 Well, just let me tell you this for a second.

280
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,080
 The motto of Satan is to worship Satan.

281
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,480
 It's not to worship Satan, it's to worship yourself.

282
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,340
 Self-worship.

283
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,320
 How do you know if you're following him?

284
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,400
 You just do you.

285
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,600
 You think about you.

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
 You rise up thinking about you.

287
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 You go to bed thinking about you.

288
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,720
 You live for you and that's all Satan

289
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,280
 is trying to get you to do.

290
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,800
 And listen, the Bible says that he disguises himself

291
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,840
 as an angel of light.

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,400
 And just because someone looks good on the outside

293
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,840
 and they have health and they have the materialism

294
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,080
 and they have the job and they have the money,

295
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 that's not always blessings from God.

296
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,680
 Because Satan will lure you and I into thinking that,

297
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,920
 hey, as long as we get those things,

298
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,000
 I must be blessed, bro.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
 And it's like, whoa, he doesn't care

300
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,680
 as long as he gets that one thing, your soul.

301
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,320
 As long as he can distract you

302
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,520
 from the creator of the universe.

303
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,240
 Listen, this was my story.

304
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,480
 I found myself thinking that I had everything

305
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
 by the world's standards.

306
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,200
 By the world's standards, I would say I had it.

307
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 I had the girl and I had the sport.

308
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,280
 I was playing baseball in college

309
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,040
 and I had the affirmation and the accolades and the awards.

310
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,300
 And man, that was the life of the party.

311
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,920
 And listen, I ran to that drug

312
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
 just to get that temporal high.

313
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,920
 I had the car.

314
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,660
 I had the materialistic possessions.

315
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,840
 I had some money.

316
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,340
 And by the end of my junior year,

317
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,400
 I just began asking myself the question, is that it?

318
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,880
 And I remember grabbing a Bible that was dusty

319
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,900
 up in my bookshelf in my apartment.

320
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,920
 I was like, man, there's gotta be something more.

321
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,480
 There's gotta be more that meets the eye.

322
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,300
 If I got everything that the world calls success,

323
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,480
 I checked that box and I'm still feeling empty

324
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,400
 and unsatisfied, then what else is there?

325
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,740
 And I remember opening to 1 John chapter three.

326
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,020
 And it says in 1 John three, I believe verse four,

327
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,900
 it says that when you live in continuous sin,

328
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,460
 it shows that you belong to the devil

329
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,960
 who's been sinning since the beginning.

330
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,820
 But the son of God, Jesus, came to destroy

331
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,340
 the works of the devil.

332
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,980
 And those who have been born into God's family

333
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,100
 do not make a practice of sinning because God is in them.

334
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,420
 I realized that I was a child of the devil.

335
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,220
 Like that seems extreme, right?

336
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,500
 But the Bible says that when you make a practice of sinning,

337
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,380
 you keep doing the same thing over and over

338
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,260
 and not having any convictions to turn from that sin,

339
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,340
 then you are a child of the devil.

340
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,540
 And that night, man, my mouth was stopped

341
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,820
 of all justification.

342
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,140
 I was following the prince of the power of the air

343
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,700
 and everything on the outside, man, it looked good.

344
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,360
 I had it.

345
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,360
 I thought I reached success only to find myself

346
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,180
 in a place of depression, full of anxiety.

347
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,420
 I was a child of the devil.

348
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,820
 I was a child of the devil.

349
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,180
 I was a child of the devil.

350
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,420
 I was a child of the devil.

351
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,620
 I was a child of the devil.

352
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,940
 I was a child of the devil.

353
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,260
 I was a child of the devil.

354
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,540

417
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,020
 I was a child of the devil.

418
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,840

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,680
 I was a child of the devil.

420
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,520
 I was a child of the devil.

421
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,340
 I was a child of the devil.

422
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,180
 I was a child of the devil.

423
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,020
 I was a child of the devil.

424
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,840
 I was a child of the devil.

425
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,680
 I was a child of the devil.

426
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
 I was a child of the devil.

427
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,340
 I was a child of the devil.

428
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,180
 I was a child of the devil.

429
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,020
 I was a child of the devil.

430
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,840
 I was a child of the devil.

431
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,680
 I was a child of the devil.

432
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
 I was a child of the devil.

433
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,340
 I was a child of the devil.

434
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,180
 I was a child of the devil.

435
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
 It feels good.

436
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:45,320
 Bible says, it goes on, it says,

437
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,520
 "By nature, we're children of wrath

438
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,860
 like the rest of mankind."

439
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,860
 What that means is that we were born apart from God

440
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,100
 with a sinful nature.

441
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,140
 By the time we came out of our mama's womb,

442
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,640
 by nature, we're sinners.

443
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,780
 Like, you gotta understand this.

444
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,980
 When I was reading this, I'm like,

445
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,900
 this is just natural.

446
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,280
 This is just what we gravitate to, right?

447
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,060
 Like, this is, no one has to teach me how to sin.

448
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,700
 Like, I'm varsity.

449
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,440
 Like, that's just my life, right?

450
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
 Sin isn't just something we do.

451
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,360
 Sin is something we are.

452
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,940
 Psalm 51.5 backs up what I'm saying here.

453
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,420
 It says this, "Surely I was sinful at birth,

454
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,940
 sinful from the time my mother conceived me."

455
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,700
 And this became also real when my wife and I,

456
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,240
 Kathy, started to have kids about six years ago.

457
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,140
 And we birthed these kids, we, she did, praise God.

458
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,580
 (laughing)

459
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,620
 Bless you.

460
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,020
 If you're listening to this right now, babe, I love you.

461
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,660
 Thank you.

462
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,660
 But we began to start, you know, just being parents.

463
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,220
 And it was cute, man.

464
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,420
 Like, they come out of the room and they start crying,

465
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,940
 but then they put them on their chest.

466
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,940
 And man, this is one of the most amazing experiences

467
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,920
 of my life.

468
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,280
 But then they begin to grow up and become toddlers.

469
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,820
 And it's like you're raising a,

470
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,060
 you're raising a small terrorist.

471
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,540
 (laughing)

472
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,060
 I mean, that's kind of what it is, right?

473
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,020
 I mean, they scratch and they bite

474
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,900
 and they throw temper tantrums in the grocery store.

475
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
 And they're just, I mean,

476
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,140
 and I didn't have to teach them that.

477
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,180
 It's just, that's just what came natural, right?

478
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,460
 I mean, this was the other day.

479
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,300
 I mean, I'm trying, we're trying to put our,

480
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,260
 our four-year-old daughter down to sleep.

481
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,780
 And here's a picture.

482
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,880
 And she's just mean mugging us.

483
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,100
 This is Isabella and her sister in the back, man,

484
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,700
 she's doing, she's doing what all older brothers

485
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,220
 and sisters do, they're rule followers.

486
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,780
 So she's sleeping.

487
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,740
 And she's just looking at us like, now what?

488
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,580
 What are you going to say?

489
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,420
 You're going to make me go to sleep?

490
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,560
 It's like, what do we do with that?

491
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,580
 I guess just like, you know, put her outside and, you know,

492
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,700
 tell her to do some laps in the backyard.

493
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
 But she's just looking at us right there.

494
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,260
 And she's just like, man, what, what are you going to do?

495
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,900
 And I didn't have to teach her that.

496
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,020
 She's like, no, I'm not taking a nap.

497
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,940
 It's like, okay, I guess you're not taking a nap,

498
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,300
 but I'm going to give you a consequence for that.

499
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,700
 And so that's the crazy thing.

500
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,420
 Like it's been so good being a parent

501
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,120
 because you see this sinful nature

502
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,580
 from the time they were born.

503
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,720
 And listen, we can laugh at her rebellion.

504
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,680
 And it's kind of cute when you're five,

505
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,820
 but it's destructive when you're 25.

506
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,380
 And what she needs is a new nature.

507
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,140
 And the same is true for you and I.

508
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,980
 We were born with a sinful nature

509
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,160
 that has no cure apart from Christ.

510
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,220
 Let me illustrate it this way.

511
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,600
 (pages flipping)

512
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,640
 This is you, this is you and I, right?

513
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,920
 And the Bible says that God created everything to be perfect

514
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,160
 but he wanted to give you and I a choice.

515
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,020
 He wanted to give man, woman a choice.

516
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,200
 So he gave them one rule and you know what happened

517
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
 in the garden, they ate the apple

518
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,280
 and sin entered the world that sent creation into chaos.

519
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,960
 And so everything is broken because of sin.

520
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,080
 There's nothing that's just perfect.

521
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,620
 There's nothing holy, there's nothing right.

522
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,920
 Sin is a result of, suffering is a result of all sin,

523
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
 I should say.

524
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,600
 And so we feel it throughout our week,

525
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,120
 sometimes in small ways and sometimes in big ways.

526
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,440
 Whether it's cancer or someone mismanaging information

527
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,240
 about us and gossiping, like we feel the weight of sin.

528
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,480
 And so the Bible says that all have sinned

529
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
 and fallen short of the glory of God.

530
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,440
 And it's just, it's tainted our life.

531
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,080
 Like we're no longer perfect.

532
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,400
 Like we've fallen short of God's standard.

533
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,840
 His standard is perfection.

534
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,360
 The Bible says in Romans 6, 23,

535
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,160
 "For the wages of sin is death."

536
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,560
 It's brought death and destruction upon our life.

537
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,400
 And no matter what you try to do to make that right,

538
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,520
 the Bible says you just make a bigger mess

539
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,260
 and sin just continues to rule you more and more.

540
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,440
 And the Bible says in Romans 3, 11,

541
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,000
 "That there is none righteous, no not one."

542
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,760
 Like we've fallen so far away from God's standard,

543
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,220
 which is perfection.

544
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,440
 And the Bible says if we die in our sin,

545
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,320
 we forfeit the grace of God.

546
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,480
 And the only thing left for us is His wrath.

547
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,320
 Did you see that?

548
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,080
 Like earlier in the text, it says we're children of wrath.

549
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,800
 And listen, we don't like talking about wrath

550
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,040
 and we don't like talking about hell,

551
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,840
 but this book, Jesus talks about hell twice as much

552
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,640
 as he talks about heaven in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

553
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,320
 And I meet with young adults every single week

554
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,360
 and I just say, "Hey, if God allowed sin into heaven,

555
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,240
 "what would it look like?"

556
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,900
 And they're like, "Man, it would look broken,

557
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,180
 "like my life and the world would no longer,

558
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,520
 "or heaven would no longer be a perfect place."

559
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,160
 I said, "You're right."

560
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,720
 So therefore God must assess a penalty for sin.

561
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
 And that penalty is hell.

562
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,680
 Total separation from God, your creator.

563
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,720
 And I just say, "Hey, but God never intended

564
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 "for it to be that way, so He came up with another plan."

565
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
 And this is where we see the good news in Ephesians 2.

566
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,640
 Verse four, look at what it says.

567
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 "But God being rich in mercy."

568
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
 Like that's a great big but right there.

569
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,040
 Like that is huge.

570
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,240
 That's what I'm talking about right now,

571
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
 your sinful nature, right?

572
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,540
 Your guess, your mind is all up in the gutter.

573
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,320
 (congregation laughing)

574
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,240
 But thank the Lord for that, that one phrase,

575
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,160
 "But God being rich in mercy

576
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,080
 "because of the great love with which He loved us,

577
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,800
 "even when we were dead in our trespasses."

578
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 What did He do?

579
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,740
 "He made us alive together with Christ.

580
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,560
 "By grace you have been saved.

581
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,800
 "And He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him

582
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,520
 "in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

583
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
 That's our standing, that's where we're headed

584
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,240
 for those of us in Christ, so that in the coming ages

585
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,680
 He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace

586
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,760
 and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.

587
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
 The coming ages, when He comes back,

588
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,000
 I've read the rest of the book.

589
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,840
 Revelation, He's coming back.

590
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,940
 This time, not as a suffering servant hanging on a cross,

591
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:03,400
 but as a mighty warrior coming for His church,

592
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,320
 for the believer.

593
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,080
 And it goes on and says, "For by grace you have been saved

594
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,560
 "through faith, and this is not your own doing.

595
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,360
 "It is a gift of God, not a result of works,

596
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,960
 "so that no one may boast."

597
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,140
 Point number two, what Christ has done.

598
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,600
 What Christ has done, but God,

599
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,720
 this one phrase, being rich in mercy,

600
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,180
 it's this idea of abundance, it's this idea of overflow.

601
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,640
 It never runs out, like some of us,

602
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,700
 man, we're worried about cost of inflation rising, right?

603
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,200
 Like the cost of food or the cost of gas

604
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,640
 or the cost of rent, like, talked to a bunch of young adults

605
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,520
 like, man, my rent is just skyrocketing,

606
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,120
 and I don't know if my paycheck is gonna be suffice

607
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,860
 to pay for all these things.

608
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,840
 But God's saying, hey, not in my economy.

609
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,580
 My grace is rich in mercy, and it never runs out.

610
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,000
 His grace never runs out.

611
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,180
 There will always be enough for those of us

612
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,980
 that bend the knee and surrender our life to Him.

613
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,820
 Why?

614
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,540
 Because of the great love in which He loved us.

615
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,200
 He proved this by dying on the cross for your sin and mine.

616
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,980
 Grace, it's this idea that you can't earn it.

617
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,940
 There's nothing you can do.

618
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,320
 We don't deserve it, but that's the whole point of grace.

619
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,060
 If you could deserve it, then it would not be grace.

620
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,480
 There's no one in this room tonight

621
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,160
 that has done something so terrible that grace won't cover.

622
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,820
 Like, some of you are like, no, no, not me,

623
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,380
 just you don't know what I've done.

624
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,440
 My sin is just too great for God.

625
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,080
 Like, my life is stained.

626
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,040
 That past abortion, you know, that embezzling money.

627
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,760
 I mean, you don't know what's happened to me.

628
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,720
 Like, maybe even murders are part of your story.

629
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,560
 Like, nothing is too great for God.

630
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,080
 That adultery, nothing is too great for God.

631
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,680
 The thing that you think that you're gonna take to the grave,

632
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,120
 nothing is too great for God.

633
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,520
 Oh, no, no, not me, just you don't understand my story.

634
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,320
 No, no, no, I might not understand your story,

635
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,200
 but you don't understand the grace and the mercy of God.

636
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,080
 It's for you, all you need is need to come to God.

637
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,680
 The prereq, the prequalification to come to God

638
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,240
 is not you trying to pull your bootstraps up

639
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,720
 and white knuckle it and modify your behavior

640
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,660
 and do some good works to make yourself right.

641
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,960
 No, it's to bend the knee.

642
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,880
 Like, that's the problem for some of us, man.

643
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,120
 Like, we don't understand,

644
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 we don't fathom the grace that's being offered to us.

645
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,600
 Like, some of us think, man, our works,

646
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 like, good works right here, right here.

647
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,920
 The good works that I do,

648
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,800
 this is gonna be enough to make me right with God.

649
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,360
 I'm gonna, you know, maybe volunteer

650
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,580
 at the animal rescue shelter.

651
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,160
 I'm gonna go to church every Sunday.

652
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,900
 Oh, I'm gonna be at the porch, the porch.

653
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,740
 That's what I'm gonna do.

654
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,360
 I'm gonna climb to the porch every Tuesday night.

655
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm gonna carry my Bible.

656
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
 I'm gonna get, I'm gonna know some memory verses.

657
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,360
 I'm gonna memorize scripture.

658
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
 Hey, I'm gonna get the cross tattoo, man.

659
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,240
 I'm gonna look good on the outside.

660
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,240
 Some of you are like, man, I'm gonna go a step further.

661
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,320
 I'm gonna be a member of this.

662
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,160
 That's what I'm gonna do.

663
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,720
 I'm gonna be a member of Watermark Community Church.

664
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,520
 I'm gonna get in community group.

665
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,380
 Hey, I might even get baptized.

666
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,380
 That sounds like the next thing for me to do.

667
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,780
 On this hamster wheel of just performance, good works.

668
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,000
 And all you do is make a bigger mess.

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,380
 Because it's your work that you're submitting to,

670
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,000
 not his work.

671
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,340
 And that's not the point of the gospel.

672
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,180
 The point of the gospel is God, I can't, but you can.

673
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,640
 Like I talk to young adults and I say,

674
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,140
 hey, if God should let you into heaven,

675
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,160
 what would you say?

676
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,700
 And a lot of times it starts with because I,

677
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,860
 and I'm like, you missed it.

678
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,180
 If you could get to heaven because of you,

679
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,580
 what was the point of Jesus dying on the cross?

680
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,080
 There's nothing we can do.

681
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,340
 That's the whole point of grace.

682
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,460
 Well, that's scandalous, Josiah.

683
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,540
 What, I can't do anything?

684
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,640
 You can't do anything.

685
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,140
 Because if you could do something,

686
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,780
 then you and I would surely boast about it.

687
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:46,420
 And when we boast about it, then who gets the credit?

688
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,260
 We do.

689
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,560
 Not him, not what he did for you on the cross.

690
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,200
 And so the only thing that we can do is point to him,

691
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
 point to Christ.

692
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,300
 Like some of us, like we can't fathom this grace

693
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,200
 because when you're a kid, you would mess up

694
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,500
 and maybe you got caught by your parents

695
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,380
 or you would go confess something to them

696
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,060
 and you would just be met with like just this,

697
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,060
 just this anger and they would shun you.

698
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,420
 Maybe you confessed that you lied

699
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,180
 or you got found out at that party that you threw

700
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,480
 when your parents went out of town

701
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,180
 and the house was cleaner than it was before they left.

702
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,200
 They're like, something ain't right.

703
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,140
 That was my story.

704
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,180
 But, but, but, but, but that's what we would do, right?

705
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
 And then they found out and they just shunned it

706
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,060
 and they didn't create a space and a place

707
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
 for you to be real and authentic.

708
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,940
 So you went into hiding.

709
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,260
 Or maybe you confessed that you were gay

710
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,060
 and they just said, I'm done ostracizing.

711
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,840
 And you can't fathom grace because that was your experience.

712
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,620
 And so you view God in the same way

713
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,060
 that you view your parents.

714
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,900
 As a dad of three kids, I wanna create a safe place

715
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,700
 for them to be able to confess

716
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,380
 or for them to be able to share

717
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,400
 whatever they're going through.

718
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,940
 So I'll put my little girls down to bed,

719
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,260
 you know, every night except Tuesday

720
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,020
 and I'll just say, hey, how's your heart?

721
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
 What was the high of your day?

722
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,180
 What was the low of your day?

723
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,220
 What, how are you doing?

724
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,620
 Hey, you know, daddy, you can tell daddy anything you want

725
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,100
 and I promise you, I'm still gonna love you

726
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,460
 not because you did or didn't do what daddy wanted.

727
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,740
 And so I'll ask them this question before we go to bed,

728
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,500
 just say, hey, what's the gospel?

729
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,340
 Like, what is it?

730
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,300
 Camille, Isabella, what is the gospel?

731
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
 And I'll begin to reiterate it to them

732
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,900
 and we were out and they were in their princess dresses

733
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,700
 the other night when they were riding scooters

734
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,980
 and I just sat them down, I just said,

735
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,180
 hey, what is the gospel?

736
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,620
 And I filmed it, here's what they said.

737
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,180
 What is the gospel?

738
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,580
 - The gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ.

739
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,380
 That he died on the cross for our sins

740
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,300
 and rose again on the third day

741
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,980
 to the feet of sin and death.

742
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,700
 - That's right, this is the gospel, my friends.

743
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,180
 The gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ

744
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,740
 that he died on the cross for our sins

745
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,180
 and rose again on the third day.

746
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,820
 And listen, like it's cute when they can regurgitate it

747
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,780
 at four and almost six years old.

748
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,820
 And I love that and my wife and I were praying

749
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,580
 that, hey, that would become a reality,

750
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,860
 the truths that we're giving to them,

751
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,140
 the truths that we're sharing to them

752
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,140
 would begin to be a heart belief,

753
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,980
 that it wouldn't just be this intellectual belief

754
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,260
 and they wouldn't follow Jesus

755
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,540
 because mommy and daddy does it.

756
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,660
 And that's our heart, that's our prayer

757
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,640
 every single day for our kids.

758
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,540
 And so for some of us, man, like we see that

759
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,300
 and it is cute and I love it

760
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,000
 and I go back to that video all the time.

761
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,300
 And it's cute at four and six to regurgitate that,

762
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,320
 but when you're 25, 35 years old

763
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,060
 and you know how to answer that question,

764
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,500
 but then you look back at your life

765
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,040
 and like nothing's changed.

766
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,060
 It's not as cute.

767
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,280
 Listen, I don't say that to shame you.

768
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,540
 I don't say that to guilt you.

769
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,740
 I say that to challenge you

770
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,780
 to do an inventory tonight and say,

771
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,380
 what am I really doing with Jesus?

772
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,860
 Like, am I allowing him to change everything about my life

773
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,140
 or am I hanging on to the parts that I don't disagree with?

774
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,800
 Like when you and the Bible disagree, who wins?

775
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,700
 Like I have been going through the scriptures

776
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,340
 and I'm like, oh, that one's hard.

777
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,500
 Slow to speak, quick to listen

778
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,140
 for the anger of a man does not produce the right,

779
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,260
 ooh, that hurts.

780
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,620
 And God begins to convict me of my anger

781
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,620
 and my short tempered and my tone with my kids and my wife.

782
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:09,220
 Our salvation is an act of God's love.

783
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,420
 Jesus did what you and I can.

784
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,540
 Like Jesus lived the life that you couldn't live.

785
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,760
 He was perfect in thought, word and action.

786
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,420
 And all of our sin was poured out on him at the cross.

787
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:31,820
 And the Bible says that he soaked up

788
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,740
 the sin of the world on the cross.

789
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:46,200
 And there's nothing else that can pay for your sin

790
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,340
 and my sin.

791
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,060
 I've studied all the other religions.

792
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,100
 There's not another religion that teaches

793
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,060
 that there's a God who left the comforts of heaven

794
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,460
 and came to earth to bear a cross.

795
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,740
 And there's nothing you and I can do

796
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,900
 to be made right with God.

797
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,460
 It's everything that he's done.

798
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,900
 Like we don't climb this ladder to get to heaven

799
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,240
 and reach in spiritual enlightenment.

800
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,720
 We submit to God, the only one

801
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,960
 that died on the cross for our sin.

802
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,960
 And so he soaked up every last ounce of our sin.

803
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,720
 And the Bible says that while we were yet sinners,

804
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,640
 Romans 5, 8, Christ died for us.

805
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:42,160
 The Bible says that if we would confess with our mouth

806
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,020
 that Jesus is Lord and believe in our heart

807
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,060
 that God raised him from the dead, we would be saved.

808
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,020
 That when we put our faith and trust in Christ,

809
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,020
 he begins to soak up the sin in our life.

810
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,020
 Like he begins to forgive the sin in our life.

811
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,980
 There's nothing that can take us away from Christ.

812
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,700
 He begins the work that started in us

813
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,820
 and he finishes that work.

814
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,160
 Jesus is the only one, my friends,

815
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,740
 that can forgive you of your sin.

816
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,740
 There's no amount of good works, only Christ, only Christ.

817
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:35,020
 And so we come to God and say,

818
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,700
 "God, would you take all of our sin on you?

819
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,200
 "Would you forgive me of my sin?

820
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,200
 "Would you allow this bag of bones to become life

821
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,760
 "because we're dead in our trespasses and sins?"

822
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,660
 But the Bible says he's made us alive together in Christ.

823
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,980
 Have you made that decision?

824
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,800
 Have you made that decision

825
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,080
 that could change everything about your life?

826
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,900
 It goes on, it says in verse 10

827
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,520
 that we are his workmanship,

828
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,820
 created in Christ Jesus for good works,

829
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,020
 which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.

830
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,960
 Like we go back to good works,

831
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,100
 not so that good works would save us,

832
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,580
 but the Bible says that, hey, once you are saved,

833
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,180
 like you've been saved from work,

834
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,020
 you don't work for your salvation,

835
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,020
 that is a free gift of God so that you and I can't boast.

836
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,020
 But it says, hey, once you've accepted that free gift,

837
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,360
 that grace, that mercy,

838
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:48,080
 then he has prepared good works for you to walk into.

839
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,340
 The sin in your life no longer conquers you.

840
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,820
 And so you don't work for your salvation,

841
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,220
 but you do work from your salvation

842
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,620
 and you take what Christ has done in your life

843
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,200
 and now you begin to pour it into the good works

844
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,820
 which he has prepared beforehand

845
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,260
 and you begin to walk in those good works.

846
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:17,020
 We are people created in Christ Jesus for good works.

847
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,480
 If your salvation is not followed by good works,

848
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,980
 then you might not be saved.

849
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,360
 Do you see good work in your life?

850
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,880
 Once God saves you, he creates you for good works,

851
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,400
 which just means that he's put desires in you

852
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,020
 that were not there before.

853
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,020
 Like I had no desire to pick up my Bible

854
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,660
 before that night in my apartment my junior year

855
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,880
 and read it, no desire.

856
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,720
 I had no desire to step foot into a church

857
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,000
 and get plugged in and serve.

858
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,480
 I had no desire to give my life away

859
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,040
 so that others could come to know

860
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,620
 the hope that lied within me.

861
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,600
 I had no desire until God awakened that in my life.

862
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,220
 I had no desire to go around and tell people about Jesus

863
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,220
 and share my story until God awakened that desire within me.

864
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,940
 I had no desire to memorize scripture.

865
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,080
 I had no desire to confess my sin

866
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,760
 to a smaller group of men that could know me

867
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,780
 and I could know them and they began to hold me accountable.

868
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,040
 I didn't want accountability, what?

869
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,260
 No, that's a dirty word, man, get away from me.

870
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,220
 That wasn't me.

871
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,020
 But now I desire to be fully known.

872
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:44,140
 And it gives people an opportunity to fully love me

873
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,980
 because they know all of me.

874
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,980
 They know all of me.

875
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,940
 He begins to change your desires.

876
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,220
 That's what this text is saying.

877
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,880
 And you begin to walk in those good works.

878
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,900
 So if your faith is not producing good works,

879
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,740
 what do you do?

880
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,900
 Though the answer isn't that you would just

881
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,700
 start walking out what I just said.

882
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,300
 That would be just as useless as you taking a piece of fruit

883
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,540
 and putting it on a dead tree,

884
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,300
 hoping that it would become alive.

885
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,900
 No, that you would see that you are dead apart from Christ,

886
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,060
 that you need a new nature,

887
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,900
 that you need him to come into your life

888
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,420
 and you need to bend your knee

889
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,460
 and you need to surrender your life to Christ

890
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,540
 and say, God, I need you.

891
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,900
 I can't produce these desires apart from you

892
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,500
 because my nature is bad.

893
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,660
 It's destructive.

894
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,500
 Is that you tonight?

895
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,980
 Do you need a new nature?

896
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,780
 Have you embraced the overwhelming love and grace

897
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,380
 given to you by Christ

898
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,220
 and what he's done for you on the cross?

899
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,620
 And through his resurrection

900
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,300
 that he defeated sin and death.

901
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,340
 For those of us that are saved,

902
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,180
 we need to understand that we are his workmanship.

903
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,260
 This Greek word, poema,

904
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,780
 it was where we get the Greek word,

905
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,900
 or before we get the word poem.

906
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,580
 We are his workmanship.

907
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,760
 He's created us in Christ Jesus

908
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,360
 to compose something beautiful that will glorify him.

909
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,060
 There's a song that Davy is gonna sing tonight

910
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,140
 that she wrote and she composed that

911
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,700
 not so that she would get the affirmation from men

912
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,360
 but so that she would get the affirmation from God

913
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,900
 so that she would begin to please God

914
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,200
 with all of her being,

915
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,380
 with the gifts and the talents that she's been given.

916
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,060
 That's what God is calling you and I to do

917
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,060
 when we step foot into our office tomorrow

918
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,580
 that whatever you're doing is now your mission field.

919
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,740
 You might be in business

920
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,060
 but you leverage business for the glory of God

921
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,860
 so that others can come to know him.

922
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,180
 You might be a nurse or you might be a doctor

923
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,480
 but you're leveraging that.

924
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,920
 You might help people physically but spiritually,

925
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
 you know that they're dead apart from Christ

926
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,720
 and so you begin to leverage that

927
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,040
 so that others can come to know that hope.

928
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,920
 You might be a barista

929
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,680
 and your job isn't just to make coffee

930
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,780
 but your job is to step into the good works

931
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,620
 that God has prepared before him

932
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,520
 in the same way that Steve Jobs created the iPhone.

933
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,560
 That was his workmanship to change the world.

934
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,320
 Jesus is calling you and I to step foot

935
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,960
 into the good works,

936
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,480
 into the spaces and the places that you go every day

937
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,720
 so that he gets the glory,

938
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,840
 you get the joy,

939
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,640
 you understand why you were created

940
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,520
 and that the world around us receives the good.

941
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,280
 Let me pray that you would tonight.

942
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,520
 God in heaven,

943
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,580
 thank you for your goodness and your mercy on our life.

944
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,880
 Apart from you, God, we are dead.

945
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,680
 Oh, we might be physically being,

946
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,480
 we might be alive physically but we are dead spiritually.

947
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,080
 We're dead men and women walking

948
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,160
 and so God, would you begin to awaken

949
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,100
 men and women in this moment,

950
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,460
 first and foremost, those that need a new nature.

951
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,660
 (gentle music)

952
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,580
 That they would see that they can do nothing apart from you.

953
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,960
 There's nothing that they can do to be made right.

954
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,220
 And God, tonight, they would believe,

955
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,460
 they would have the faith

956
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,020
 to accept what you've done for them

957
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,760
 and that they would confess with their mouth

958
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,400
 that you are truly the leader of their life.

959
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,520
 (gentle music)

960
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,120
 And God, you would begin a work in them

961
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,840
 that you've never done before.

962
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,520
 And for those of us that are saved,

963
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,920
 we're walking with the Lord,

964
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,040
 that we wouldn't give up when we fall into sin

965
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,920
 but that we would remind ourself of the gospel,

966
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,440
 that we'd run back to Ephesians 2, 1 through 10

967
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,140
 and we would believe the gospel.

968
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,440
 As some of us, we would not wanna admit

969
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,200
 that we're probably worse than what I even

970
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
 failed to articulate tonight,

971
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,300
 that we're more depraved than what we care to admit

972
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,300
 but we're more loved than what we probably express.

973
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:35,000
 And so would we walk in light of those two realities tonight

974
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,880
 and God, would that produce in us a desire for more of you

975
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,020
 no matter where we find ourselves tonight.

976
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,740
 No matter what circumstances are going on in our life,

977
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,380
 no matter what sin we're wrestling with,

978
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,660
 what sin we're trying to fight,

979
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,900
 would we have a reality that the gospel is enough?

980
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,260
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
