1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,980
 - Porsche, how we doing?

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,520
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,120
 Awesome, it's really fun worshiping with you guys.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,000
 I wanna start here.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,200
 I want you to picture me at 18 years of age,

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 and so about 90 pounds lighter, better hair, less stars.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,040
 And so there I am, just a confused high schooler,

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
 senior year in high school,

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
 and I've got this 1979 Mercedes Benz.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,040
 I mean, you know, with, says Superfly on the back window.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,020
 It's got hydraulics.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,480
 I mean, that's, you know, I'm in 4H and FFA.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
 I'm a confused young man.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,900
 I just quit athletics to try to pass Algebra II,

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,300
 and my mom comes to me, and she sits me down,

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,720
 and it's this serious talk.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,180
 It has some weight to it, and she's a counselor,

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,120
 I should tell you, like a school counselor.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
 So she does this for a living,

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,080
 and she says, "Where do you wanna go to college?"

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,440
 Now, you may have known the answer to this question

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,940
 since you were in the third grade,

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,320
 but what's crazy is I hadn't thought about it much.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,520
 I don't know.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,040
 And she says, "Well, what do you wanna study?"

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,160
 Nothing.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,240
 I don't like studying, you know?

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,740
 And she asked this question.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,380
 "Well, what are you passionate about?

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,800
 "What are you passionate about?"

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,440
 I'm 18 years old with a 1979 Mercedes

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,240
 that says Superfly on the back window.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,960
 Like, what are you asking?

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,680
 What kind of profound answer to this question?

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,880
 'Cause it feels like I'm about to carve a path

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,860
 for the rest of my life by the answer to this question.

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,640
 And so I'm 18, what am I passionate about?

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,880
 I don't know, being liked, Dawson's Creek,

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,620
 and, you know,

41
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,360
 spring break, beer,

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,640
 skateboarding, art.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,440
 She's like, "We can work with that."

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,880
 What did you just say?

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
 Art?

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
 Yes.

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
 I was like, "What, what do you have in mind?"

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,240
 She's like, "There's this school in Waco," not Baylor,

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,340
 "a little school you've never heard of

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,240
 "that you can go and study art."

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,600
 I'm like, "Cool, awesome.

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
 "That sounds great, I'll go and do that."

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,480
 So I did, so I moved to Waco.

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
 I go to this little technical school, I study art,

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,360
 and I'm there for two years.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
 I graduate with a two-year degree.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,540
 I've got this diploma, but here's what I learned in college

58
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,440
 is I like art when I can kind of do art on my own terms

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,680
 and kind of come up and create with whatever I want.

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
 I don't like art as an assignment.

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,920
 I don't like someone telling me what to art, if you will.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,840
 And so I'm like, I don't really wanna do this.

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
 So then I've got this diploma, this degree, if you will,

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,160
 that says, "Hey, now you can do this for a living,"

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,400
 but it's pretty much worthless

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
 'cause what I've determined in the past two years

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,040
 is I don't wanna do this for a living.

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,600
 And so I'm back to this question,

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,240
 "What are you passionate about?"

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,560
 And I don't know.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,400
 Like now I'm just a slightly older version of me

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,520
 when I was 18.

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,880
 I'm passionate a lot about a lot of the same things,

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,080
 except for now it's One Tree Hill,

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,260
 and so I'm just like, I don't know, you know?

76
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,080
 What am I passionate about?

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,240
 And so I remember specifically in Waco,

78
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,760
 waking up early one morning, praying for a job.

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,280
 I'm like, "God, I need a job."

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,920
 And so what am I passionate?

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,200
 I'm passionate about eating and not starving to death.

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,560
 So I wake up early in the morning.

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,000
 I don't know where to go to look for a job.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,920
 Like you probably have all kinds of great places to go.

85
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,440
 I just go to the mall and it's not open.

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,760
 And so I sat in the parking lot, "Lord, give me a job."

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
 And the mall opens, I walk through it.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,060
 This girl comes up to me and says, "Hey, what do you do?"

89
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,040
 I said, "I'm looking for a job."

90
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,760
 She says, "You wanna manage an Abercrombie & Fitch?"

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
 I say, "Yes, I do so much."

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,800
 She says, "Where?"

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,920
 I say, "How about Dallas?"

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
 She says, "Dunn."

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,560
 I'm like, "This is how this prayer thing works.

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
 "This is amazing."

97
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,520
 And so you know those guys that stand in front of Abercrombie

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,920
 with their shirt off?

99
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
 I was not one of those guys, okay?

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,120
 I took my shirt off once, they said, "Put it back on."

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,520
 Anyways, and so I worked there

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
 and here's what I learned there.

103
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,400
 I was not passionate about that, okay?

104
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,940
 I was not passionate about folding clothes at midnight

105
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,160
 and I was doing a lot of that.

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120
 So I thought, you know, I need to go find a new job.

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
 What am I passionate about?

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,400
 Okay, I'll go work at a gym.

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,880
 So then I'm selling gym memberships

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,200
 and I learned there that I wasn't passionate about that.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,360
 And so then I go and I work for this design company,

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
 Graphic Design, I'm like, okay, I can put my degree to use.

113
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
 And then I remembered, no, I'm not passionate

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
 about doing other people's art.

115
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,440
 And then I go work for this consulting firm,

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
 doing sales for them.

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
 And I learned I wasn't passionate about that.

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
 And then I went and worked at telecom.

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
 And what I found about this time of my life

120
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,400
 is I was passionate about making money.

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
 And I was passionate about myself.

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,600
 And I came to a place where my passion

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,920
 was taking me in and out of jobs.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,880
 And I kind of found myself despairing a little bit.

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,240
 And I don't know if you've ever been there,

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,840
 but you get real philosophical in these times.

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,000
 Like you're having really grand philosophical discussions,

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,160
 usually on the back of a tailgate with a beer.

129
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,920
 And you're like, what if I'm supposed

130
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
 to be a race car driver?

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,780
 (congregation laughing)

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,280
 Like what if I'm the fastest race car driver in the world?

133
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,000
 And I just don't know, 'cause I've never driven one.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
 Like I need to find this out.

135
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,680
 And you're having these kinds of discussions.

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,700
 And it usually almost always goes to this,

137
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,200
 I just wanna shack on the beach and surf.

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
 My buddy's like, have you ever surfed?

139
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,800
 No, but I bet I could.

140
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,040
 And the Christian version of this is,

141
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,160
 I think I need to move to Africa.

142
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,800
 I don't know why, but all the Christians,

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,740
 when they kinda hit that wall, wherever they're at,

144
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,200
 they're like, let's go build water wells in Africa

145
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,560
 or do something amazing in Africa, care for the orphans.

146
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,480
 And so somehow all the Christians end up in Africa.

147
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,720
 But this is the problem.

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,560
 And I want you to know this, it's not your fault.

149
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,040
 It's not your fault, you've been fed this.

150
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,640
 In fact, I wanna show you something rather profound.

151
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,400
 There's this phrase, follow your passions.

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
 You ever heard that, follow your passion?

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,640
 You know that little phrase was virtually not there.

154
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,720
 It was not here before 1980.

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
 And I'm gonna show you on this graph behind me,

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
 if you will, and I'll just read this to you.

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,080
 And so the phrase, follow your passion,

158
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,840
 went from being virtually non-existent in 1980

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,160
 to one and a half million times in 1990.

160
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,680
 So all of a sudden, it shows up in English literature.

161
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,320
 This is not search engine, so you're like,

162
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,200
 well, that's 'cause the internet.

163
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,640
 No, this is written, this is typed in English literature.

164
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
 One day, it's not there.

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,000
 A decade later, it's one and a half million times.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,320
 And then if you keep going and you see that in the 2000s,

167
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,560
 it's just skyrocketed to then in 2008,

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,920
 over 21 million times in English literature,

169
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,120
 you could find this idea of follow your passion.

170
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
 And the reason I tell you that is because

171
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,040
 that's what you've been sold for the past 20 years.

172
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,280
 Follow your passion.

173
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,360
 And I want you to know something right up front.

174
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,760
 That's really, really, really bad advice.

175
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,160
 It's really bad advice.

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 It flies in the face of what God's word teaches, okay?

177
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,520
 We are to bring our passion under control of the Spirit.

178
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,600
 We're to find a greater passion.

179
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,480
 We're to pursue God's passions.

180
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,000
 We're to inform our own passions.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,160
 But we are not to just follow our passion.

182
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
 So if you've been fed that,

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
 then I'm so excited that you're here tonight

184
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,220
 because I want you to know something.

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,720
 In my great-grandfather's day,

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,040
 in your great-grandfather's day,

187
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,000
 he never asked himself, let me sit back,

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,320
 man, what am I passionate about?

189
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
 What do I wanna do for a living?

190
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,720
 He's like, I'm gonna be a farmer.

191
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,440
 My dad was a farmer, his dad was a farmer.

192
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,160
 We're a family of farmers, so I'm gonna farm.

193
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
 Why?

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,240
 'Cause I wanna eat.

195
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
 And it's that simple.

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,800
 It was a pragmatic approach to life.

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,760
 I'm gonna grow stuff so I can eat it and not die, okay?

198
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,600
 And then we show up on the scene

199
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,240
 and we got all these profound tools.

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,520
 We got Myers-Briggs and DISC and Strength Finder

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,760
 and lion, otter, beaver, I'm woo, you know?

202
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,120
 And we're kinda like, we're a really introspective group, us.

203
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
 We sure are.

204
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,040
 And so we have all of these tools at our disposal

205
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,740
 and you would think we'd get a lot better at this,

206
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,640
 but we're awful at it.

207
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,000
 We're the worst that any other demographic's ever been at it

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
 and it's not your fault.

209
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,760
 It's what you've been taught,

210
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,400
 but I want to reteach you tonight from God's word

211
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,360
 so that you can leave here with the right perspective

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,620
 on work and passion.

213
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,840
 To show you that we're not getting better at it,

214
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,400
 from Forbes Magazine, 2012, 91% of millennials

215
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,560
 expect to stay in a job for less than three years.

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,120
 Tom Rainier in Millennials, his book, said this,

217
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,320
 that we stay only two years at a job

218
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,380
 compared to baby boomers, an average of seven.

219
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,540
 So we're jumping jobs, more jobs, we have more options,

220
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,860
 but less commitment, which translates to less skills

221
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,440
 because we haven't developed them,

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
 because we're changing them

223
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
 with whatever passion shows up that day.

224
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,540
 And so that brings me to my point.

225
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,240
 Don't follow your passion, but develop your passions

226
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
 and use them for your purpose.

227
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000
 If you're here and you're a follower of Christ,

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,740
 I'm gonna talk to you tonight, if you're not a guest,

229
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,840
 I know that's about half of you,

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,280
 if you're not a follower of Christ, rather,

231
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,880
 I know that's about half of you, listen in

232
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,960
 and hopefully you'll gain insight to a Christian worldview.

233
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
 But if you're here and you're a follower of Christ,

234
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,560
 your purpose is to know God and to make him known,

235
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,880
 is to know God and to make him known.

236
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,360
 So don't follow your passions, develop your passions

237
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,320
 and use them for your purpose.

238
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
 And so we're asking the question tonight,

239
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
 this is the subject of this evening,

240
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,480
 what if I'm not passionate about what I do?

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,200
 And so maybe that's you,

242
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,720
 maybe that's a question you've asked,

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,120
 what if I'm not passionate about what I do?

244
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
 And so from God's word,

245
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
 we're gonna come up with these three answers,

246
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,400
 change your perspective, invite God in to help you

247
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,320
 and find a greater passion.

248
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,840
 And so usually if you hang out at the porch much,

249
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 you know that I pick a passage and I camp in it,

250
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,480
 I usually break it up into three sections

251
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,460
 and then I expound on what it's saying.

252
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,560
 Tonight I'm gonna be in Luke chapter five,

253
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,720
 verses one through 11,

254
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
 and I'm gonna read all of this up front to you

255
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,840
 and then we're gonna jump around

256
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
 and I'm gonna support some ideas

257
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
 with several different verses,

258
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,320
 it's gonna be more topical in nature.

259
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
 And so Luke chapter five, this is the gospel,

260
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,200
 it's the beginning of the New Testament,

261
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,360
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, if you wanna turn there.

262
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,660
 And so Jesus's ministry is just taking off,

263
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,720
 Jesus is literally on the scene,

264
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,660
 this part of your Bible is just a historical, accurate book,

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
 it's just telling you about the life

266
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,960
 and account of Jesus Christ.

267
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
 And so one day, verse one,

268
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,960
 one day as Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret,

269
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,640
 I knew I'd messed that up,

270
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,180
 also the Sea of Galilee, if you prefer,

271
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,360
 the people were crowding around him

272
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,000
 and listening to the word of God.

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,800
 He saw at the water's edge two boats

274
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,040
 left there by the fishermen who were washing their nets.

275
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,000
 He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon.

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Now we know Jesus later changed Simon's name to Peter,

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,200
 and so if you know anything about the Bible

278
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
 where you see Simon, this is also Peter.

279
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
 And he asked him to put out a little from shore,

280
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,480
 then he sat down and he taught the people from the boat.

281
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,120
 Jesus is there, he's on the shore of the Sea of Galilee,

282
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,920
 crowds are coming up, he's teaching,

283
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,320
 and crowds are coming up so much

284
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,440
 that they're kind of pushing him back

285
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
 and pushing him back in the water,

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,340
 and he's like, "Okay, I'm about to be in the water,

287
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,640
 "okay, there's two boats here."

288
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,320
 He just looked, "I'm in a boat."

289
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,180
 And then Simon's like, "Whoa, whoa, that's my boat.

290
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,020
 "You're in my boat."

291
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,440
 He said, "Yeah, come in with me and let's go out.

292
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,500
 "Let's go out, let's push off from the shore,

293
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,920
 "and I'm gonna preach."

294
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,080
 And so I love that right off the bat,

295
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,600
 you see Simon or Peter's occupation

296
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
 as a tool for the gospel.

297
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
 Immediately, his livelihood,

298
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,040
 now let me just tell you about this boat for a minute, okay?

299
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,880
 This would have been a lifetime investment.

300
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,840
 Someone in this time could have worked their entire life

301
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,800
 to be able to afford one of these boats,

302
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,840
 and if you had one, it meant you had a job,

303
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,720
 you had an occupation, you had a way to feed your family.

304
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,640
 Why? 'Cause there's a sea there, there's water there,

305
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
 there's fish in that water,

306
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,760
 and so you were good to go if you had a boat.

307
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
 These boats would be passed on

308
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
 from generation to generation,

309
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,520
 but this boat, this particular boat, Peter's boat,

310
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,960
 is the single most famous boat in all of history.

311
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,800
 Why?

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,980
 It's most likely that this is the boat

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,280
 that Jesus went from shore to shore to shore

314
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,340
 to do ministry in.

315
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,980
 It's most likely that this is the boat

316
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,580
 that Jesus and his disciples were in

317
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,580
 when Jesus was taking a nap and a storm blows in,

318
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,920
 and he calms the storm.

319
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,060
 It's most likely that this is the boat

320
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,140
 that Peter's in when Jesus says,

321
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,760
 "Hey, come out and walk on the water."

322
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,360
 That's this boat, most likely.

323
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,820
 When he had finished, verse four, speaking,

324
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,220
 he said to Simon,

325
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,480
 "Put out into deep water

326
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,640
 "and let down the nets for a catch."

327
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,300
 Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all day

328
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,960
 "and haven't caught anything.

329
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,060
 "But because you say so, I will let down the nets."

330
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,380
 He says, "Jesus, I've been up all night working.

331
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,400
 "I don't wanna adult today, okay?

332
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,880
 "Like, don't make me go back to work today.

333
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,940
 "I've already done, you don't understand, Jesus.

334
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,720
 "I'm a fisherman by trade.

335
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,160
 "I'm a fisherman for a living.

336
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,620
 "My daddy was a fisherman.

337
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,360
 "I come from a long lineage of fishermen.

338
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,860
 "I know these seas like the back of my hand,

339
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,500
 "and they're not biting today.

340
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,060
 "Don't make me do it."

341
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:11,280
 When they had done so, verse six,

342
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,260
 they caught such a large number of fish

343
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,640
 that their nets began to break,

344
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,540
 so they signaled their partners in the other boat

345
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,160
 to come and help them, and they came

346
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,340
 and filled both boats so full that the boats began to sink.

347
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,200
 And so what happens is Peter sees more success

348
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,680
 than he had ever imagined by going out with Jesus,

349
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,920
 much more success than any other time in his career

350
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
 of being out there alone.

351
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,320
 They're catching so much fish

352
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,280
 that both boats began to sink.

353
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 And verse eight, when Simon Peter saw this,

354
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,860
 he fell at Jesus' knees and said,

355
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,840
 "Go away from me, Lord, I'm a sinful man."

356
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,040
 His immediate reaction to this success is humility.

357
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,160
 It's a sober awareness that his success

358
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 has come from Christ.

359
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,000
 This had nothing to do with his efforts

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,280
 and everything to do with who was with him in the boat.

361
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,580
 It had nothing to do with his skills,

362
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,520
 nothing to do with how hard he had trained,

363
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,840
 nothing to do with his knowledge of the sea,

364
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,800
 and everything to do with who was in the boat with him.

365
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,120
 Verse nine, "For he and his companions were astonished

366
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,440
 "at the catch of fish they had taken,

367
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,900
 "and so were James and John,

368
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,740
 "the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners."

369
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,340
 Do you see what happened?

370
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,180
 Is this success is now being used

371
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,760
 to bring attention to Jesus.

372
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,220
 Peter had so much success at his work

373
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,180
 that folks are saying, "Hey, who is this man

374
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,260
 "that Peter's with?"

375
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,680
 Better said, "Who is this man with Peter?

376
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,380
 "We must know this man."

377
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,000
 Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,400
 "From now on you will fish for people."

379
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,220
 So they pulled their boats up on shore,

380
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,180
 left everything, and followed him.

381
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,460
 Followed him.

382
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,060
 I'm gonna make you fishers of men.

383
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,460
 His work gave him a platform to reach people.

384
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,380
 And it's the same purpose of your work today.

385
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,420
 And so the first thing as we answer this question,

386
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,420
 what if I'm not passionate about what I do?

387
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,420
 The first thing I want you to do is change your perspective.

388
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,980
 You need a new perspective on work.

389
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,000
 You've been fed a lie from our culture,

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,300
 and it's really important that you leave here tonight

391
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,820
 with a new perspective.

392
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,300
 This is gonna save you a lot of pain

393
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,340
 and a lot of heartache and a lot of despair.

394
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,220
 And so I know that you graduated from college,

395
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,280
 you thought, "Hey, this is gonna come natural to me,

396
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,120
 "but here's the truth.

397
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,580
 "Here's how you need to change your perspective.

398
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,420
 "Work is hard."

399
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,820
 So I know you're on a search for your dream job.

400
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,300
 Okay, your dream job probably doesn't exist.

401
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
 It's probably not real.

402
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,860
 It's out there with the one and the unicorn.

403
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,380
 And so work is really hard.

404
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,220
 It's difficult.

405
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,180
 One thing that makes it hard

406
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,580
 is that your passions are always changing.

407
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,300
 They're constantly changing.

408
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,700
 And so Peter was passionate about fishing,

409
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,420
 but because he was unsuccessful,

410
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,220
 he came to a place where he was despairing.

411
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,140
 Okay, because he had hit some walls,

412
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,420
 because things were hard,

413
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
 he came to a place where he's like,

414
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,300
 "I don't wanna do this right now.

415
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,140
 "Okay, I'm not good.

416
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
 "I didn't do it well last night.

417
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,700
 "I just don't wanna do this."

418
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,900
 And so he's discouraged because he had been ineffective.

419
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,980
 And so some of you graduate from college,

420
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,260
 you're like, "Look at me, I'm adulting all over the place."

421
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,500
 And then the world kicks you in the teeth.

422
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,260
 And you're like, "Man."

423
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,900
 I mean, life is hard, right?

424
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,420
 Work comes along and it's like,

425
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,380
 "Well, I thought this would be hand in glove easy.

426
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,860
 "I thought this would be a natural fit."

427
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,440
 And you're like, "What, you're questioning everything.

428
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,220
 "Why did I become a teacher again?"

429
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,460
 Okay, that's funny to the teachers.

430
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,940
 (congregation laughing)

431
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,340
 And here's what I want you to know.

432
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,500
 We've said this before, it's worth writing down.

433
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,260
 Your greatest disappointments in life

434
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,060
 come from your expectations.

435
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,240
 Isn't this true?

436
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,700
 Your greatest disappointments in life

437
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,260
 come from your expectations.

438
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,860
 My little girl, Presley, she's eight years old.

439
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,420
 She's playing basketball right now.

440
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,860
 And they're really, really good.

441
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,640
 I didn't say she's really good, but they're really good.

442
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,540
 Her team, she's on a really good team.

443
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,300
 And they're undefeated, man.

444
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,400
 They've been winning every game they show up to play.

445
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
 They've won.

446
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,700
 And this past Saturday,

447
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,460
 they played Mark Cuban's daughter's team.

448
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,660
 He owns the Mavericks.

449
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,980
 (congregation laughing)

450
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,280
 And they lost real bad.

451
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,620
 And it was interesting at the end of the game,

452
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,720
 'cause Presley's not real competitive,

453
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,380
 but there's some players on her team

454
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,860
 that are real competitive.

455
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,720
 And at the end of the game,

456
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,740
 they're looking at the scoreboard

457
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,220
 and they're just like, "What is this?

458
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,780
 "Like, how come our number's less than theirs?

459
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
 "And what is this wet stuff on my face?

460
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,440
 "And what are these emotions?

461
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,060
 "And I just don't know what happened."

462
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,860
 And we, "We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we."

463
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,460
 Wait, you lost, sweetie?

464
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,300
 No, no.

465
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,260
 And they're like, their whole world is falling apart.

466
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,700
 Why?

467
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,420
 Because they expected to win.

468
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,000
 And now they're in a place where they're like,

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,180
 "I don't know what to do with this."

470
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,820
 And it's cute when you're eight, but when you're 28,

471
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,420
 it's like, wait a minute, life,

472
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,560
 like, I'm kind of terrible at it.

473
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,740
 And I thought I'd be good at it.

474
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,620
 And why is every day so hard?

475
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,820
 And why do I just wanna stay in bed right now

476
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,700
 and not go to work and not do this?

477
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,200
 And here's how I can help you.

478
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,020
 It's hard.

479
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,620
 And it's not broken because it's hard, it's just hard.

480
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,460
 You're not doing it wrong because it's hard,

481
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,560
 it's just difficult.

482
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,540
 In some ways, it's actually supposed to be difficult.

483
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,180
 I'm gonna show you that from the scripture.

484
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,980
 But before I do, let me just say this,

485
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,600
 discouragement can rob you of your passion.

486
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,900
 Right?

487
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,760
 Like you haven't made a sale in a while.

488
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,480
 You went from hero to zero, new month, new quota.

489
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,320
 And all of a sudden, you're like,

490
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,620
 man, I don't know if I'm passionate about this.

491
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,860
 Your students are acting up, and it's not the students,

492
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,540
 it's like the parents are even worse than the students.

493
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,480
 And why aren't the parents, why are they so involved

494
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,660
 in what I'm doing and how I'm teaching?

495
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,140
 And it's like, I don't think I'm all that passionate

496
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,920
 about this, and your boss is a jerk.

497
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
 Or maybe it's not that your boss is a jerk,

498
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 maybe your team is a jerk.

499
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,500
 Maybe you work on a floor full of jerks,

500
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,980
 and you're like, I don't like the people that I work with,

501
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,820
 and I'm not passionate about this product,

502
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,220
 or passionate about this service,

503
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,700
 so I just don't wanna do it anymore,

504
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,580
 I'm moving to Africa, you know?

505
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,280
 (congregation laughing)

506
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,140
 And maybe your job is getting in the way

507
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,600
 of what you really want to do.

508
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,940
 And I want you to change your perspective,

509
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,460
 and I want you to understand that work is difficult.

510
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,540
 Let me show you from the scripture, Genesis 2, verse 15.

511
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,880
 The Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden

512
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
 to, what's that word?

513
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,100
 Work.

514
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,300
 He said, man, I want you to work.

515
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,340
 I want you to work it.

516
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,780
 Now, he's not talking about dancing.

517
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,980
 I want you to work it and take care of it, okay?

518
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,460
 I want you to work the garden,

519
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,700
 I want you to till the soil,

520
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,300
 I want you to get your shovel,

521
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,200
 and I want you to pile up dirt and plant seeds

522
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,620
 and take care of stuff and trim, you know,

523
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,380
 plants and all of that fun stuff.

524
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,840
 Now, what's interesting about that

525
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,560
 is that's Genesis chapter two.

526
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,720
 That's before what?

527
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,900
 What happens in Genesis chapter three?

528
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,920
 The fall happens in Genesis chapter three,

529
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,560
 so this is Genesis chapter two.

530
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,680
 We're still in perfection.

531
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,560
 We're still in the world is perfect as we know it,

532
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,520
 everything is right and true,

533
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,840
 and God says to man, I want you to work.

534
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,920
 Do you know we'll work in heaven?

535
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,640
 In paradise, with God, we will work.

536
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
 It's true.

537
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,080
 You will work the rest of the rest.

538
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,560
 True story, but let me show you something

539
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
 in Genesis chapter three.

540
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,040
 To Adam, verse 17, to Adam he said,

541
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
 because you listened to your wife

542
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
 and ate from the tree about which I commanded you,

543
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
 you must not eat of it.

544
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,500
 Listen to this, this is the result of that,

545
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,400
 the result of sin, if you're new to church,

546
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
 sin enters the world through this decision

547
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,720
 to not trust God.

548
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,700
 Cursed is the ground because of you.

549
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,440
 Through painful toil, you will eat of it.

550
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
 All the days of your life,

551
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,000
 it will produce thorns and thistles for you,

552
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,240
 and you will eat the plants of the field.

553
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,900
 By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food

554
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,520
 until you return to the ground

555
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,000
 since from it you were taken,

556
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,780
 for dust you are and to dust you will return.

557
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,920
 Now if you don't understand

558
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,480
 what all that theological language is,

559
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 here's what he says.

560
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,120
 Your work's gonna be hard now.

561
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,520
 Before I wanted you to work,

562
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,500
 now because you sinned, you're gonna work

563
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,880
 and it's gonna fight against you.

564
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,240
 When your alarm clock goes off,

565
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,720
 you're not gonna wanna go in anymore,

566
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
 and your boss is gonna be mean,

567
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
 and your coworkers aren't gonna get along with you,

568
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
 and there's gonna be conflict there,

569
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,900
 and you're gonna have to take the TPS reports

570
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,240
 from the client to the customer,

571
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,580
 and it's just gonna be messy.

572
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,840
 This is what God is saying there.

573
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,040
 It's in the Greek, or in the Hebrew, you can't see it,

574
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,640
 but this is what he's saying.

575
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,340
 He's saying, hey, it's going to fight against you.

576
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,360
 Then you're like, oh, that's why my boss is a jerk.

577
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,760
 It's because of Adam and Eve, the fall.

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
 It's because of sin.

579
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,600
 Yes, it is, and it's a fact.

580
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,100
 For the rest of your life, your work is going to fight.

581
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,040
 So if you're here and you're like,

582
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,120
 but I love my job, give it time.

583
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,760
 (congregation laughing)

584
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,340
 Just wait.

585
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,120
 Just wait, I promise, I don't care how,

586
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,080
 young adults tell me all the time,

587
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,620
 man, I love my job, next month.

588
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,600
 Hey, how's your job going?

589
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,400
 I quit, man.

590
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
 Thing is awful, terrible.

591
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,800
 And so work, like marriage and relationships require work.

592
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,040
 It's hard, but it's supposed to be hard, right?

593
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,160
 Post-fall is what I mean by supposed to be.

594
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,920
 And so if you were supposed to enjoy it,

595
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,040
 they wouldn't pay you to be there.

596
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,720
 Like think about this value exchange.

597
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,240
 Like if you loved what you do, they would say,

598
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,760
 hey, would you do it for free, since you love it so much?

599
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,880
 But what they say is, we know you don't like it,

600
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,420
 so in exchange for you being here,

601
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,320
 we're going to give you a paycheck.

602
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,720
 Because if you did like it, that would be a hobby,

603
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,800
 not a job, like those are things you do for fun.

604
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,080
 Job is work, you do that in exchange for money.

605
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,920
 Okay, you see how that works?

606
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
 I'm glad we're all on the same page.

607
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,000
 (congregation laughing)

608
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,020
 And so if you desire to have a job you love,

609
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,620
 that's a great thing, it's just a longing for heaven.

610
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,640
 That's a great thing.

611
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,080
 If you don't like your work, I just want you to remind,

612
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 that to be a reminder to you, you're not home yet,

613
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,520
 and one day you're gonna have a job

614
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,560
 that you absolutely love for the rest of the rest

615
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
 of the rest.

616
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,020
 But until then, your work's gonna fight against you.

617
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,600
 And so the second thing I want you to do,

618
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,780
 and this is simple, but maybe the most profound,

619
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,180
 I want you to invite God to work with you.

620
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,840
 I want you to, and before you're like,

621
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,280
 oh my goodness, Sunday School 101,

622
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,080
 invite God to work with me, what are you talking about?

623
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,740
 I just wanna ask you if you have.

624
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,640
 Like how much have you complained about your boss

625
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
 and your coworkers and what you do,

626
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,840
 and the fact that you can't keep a job or whatever that is,

627
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,960
 and how much, how often, what quantity of your life

628
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
 have you spent on your hands and knees saying,

629
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,940
 Lord, would you help me?

630
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,520
 God, would you come to work with me,

631
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,480
 would you direct my steps,

632
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,120
 would you give me favor with my boss,

633
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
 would you give me favor with my coworkers,

634
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,280
 would you give me the courage to make you famous there?

635
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,680
 I mean, tell me, if you're here and every day

636
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
 that's the cry of your heart,

637
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,400
 every day you're pleading with God that way,

638
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,140
 that's awesome, feel free to sleep

639
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
 for the rest of the night.

640
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,780
 If that's not you though,

641
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,040
 just know you're in the right place at the right time,

642
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
 and God has a word for you this evening.

643
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,760
 I want you to invite him to work with you.

644
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,760
 Every morning I wake up and I'm taking the girls to school,

645
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
 Presley and Finley, and my three-year-old son,

646
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
 he's at home, every morning he wakes up

647
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
 and he's sitting there, he's eating his cereal

648
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,440
 at the little breakfast bar,

649
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,120
 and he says, Daddy, where you going?

650
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,960
 Every morning.

651
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,160
 Weston, I'm going to work, buddy.

652
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,360
 Daddy, can I go with you?

653
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,920
 No, son, every morning.

654
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,540
 I told you yesterday no, the day before no,

655
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,520
 tomorrow it's gonna be no.

656
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,800
 Oh, Daddy, why?

657
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
 Every morning.

658
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,960
 I wanna go to work with you.

659
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
 And this is what God is saying to you

660
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,580
 in a less toddler way.

661
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,320
 I wanna go to work with you.

662
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,600
 Would you incorporate me into your profession,

663
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,640
 into your occupation?

664
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,380
 I want to go with you.

665
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,060
 And the reality is God answers prayers,

666
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,120
 and so many of us have not taken advantage of that.

667
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,440
 And so let me just ask you a question.

668
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,680
 Who cares more?

669
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,600
 Who cares more about how you perform at work?

670
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,780
 You, your boss, or God?

671
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,280
 And I promise you the answer of that is God.

672
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,880
 And so Jesus gets in the boat with Peter,

673
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,100
 and Peter listens to him.

674
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,600
 Out of an act of faith, he does what Jesus says,

675
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,560
 even though he doesn't feel like it,

676
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,440
 and the results are better than anyone could have imagined.

677
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,800
 And so what I want you to know

678
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,860
 is sometimes you are given challenges at work

679
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,600
 to show who you really trust.

680
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,840
 Sometimes you face challenges at work

681
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,000
 so that you can display and demonstrate to the world

682
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,960
 who you worship, who you are, who you trust in.

683
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
 And so when crisis hits,

684
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,200
 do you turn to your savings, to your bank account?

685
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
 Do you turn to monster.com?

686
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
 Do you turn to LinkedIn?

687
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,800
 Do you turn to your network of people?

688
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,280
 Do you turn to coping mechanisms of sin,

689
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,080
 and pornography, and spending, and shopping?

690
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,640
 Or do you turn to God and say,

691
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,080
 "God, this is really tough.

692
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,620
 "I need you to strengthen me.

693
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,560
 "I wanna remind myself of your word,

694
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,680
 "that your word is true,

695
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,740
 "and I wanna navigate these waters

696
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,920
 "in a way that makes you famous.

697
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,200
 "Will you help me?"

698
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,840
 And maybe one of the greatest examples of this is scripture.

699
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,980
 I've been hanging out with Peter in Luke chapter five,

700
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,320
 but I want you to know this is not unique to Peter.

701
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
 It's a Genesis to Revelation story.

702
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,520
 There are lots of examples in scripture

703
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,240
 of people who were faithful in really trying circumstances.

704
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,960
 I'll give you one out of Genesis chapter 38,

705
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,720
 starting in actually Genesis chapter 37,

706
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,420
 where it's Joseph, shows up on the scene.

707
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,340
 Now, Joseph is the heir to an estate,

708
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,980
 but his brothers are jealous of him,

709
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,140
 and so his own family members sell him into slavery.

710
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,500
 Now, this is a time in life when you're sold as a slave.

711
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,300
 You go from kind of hero to slave.

712
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,800
 You're like, "Okay, God, are you really with me?"

713
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,900
 But what it says that he does is he goes,

714
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,020
 and he ends up working for Potiphar.

715
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,960
 And Potiphar's a wealthy man, reports to Pharaoh,

716
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,240
 and it says that Joseph is so faithful,

717
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,520
 he's not sitting there like, "What?

718
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,640
 "I'm a slave, how did this happen?

719
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,400
 "I just want to sulk in my pity."

720
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,100
 It says he got after it.

721
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,160
 It's the message version.

722
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 He got after it, and God rewarded his faithfulness,

723
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,720
 and Potiphar puts him over his entire estate.

724
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,120
 That's until Potiphar's wicked, witchable wife comes

725
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,020
 and tries to get Joseph to sleep with her.

726
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,660
 Joseph gets arrested, even though he's innocent,

727
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,780
 and he goes to prison.

728
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,860
 Now you would think, "Okay, slavery, now prison."

729
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,740
 All right, God's not with Joseph.

730
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,100
 This is where Joseph falls apart, he despairs.

731
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,860
 This is where he has the job that he really doesn't like.

732
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,100
 But what the Scripture says is he was so faithful in prison

733
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,180
 that the warden, the prison warden,

734
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,100
 put him over the entire prison.

735
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,120
 Joseph is ruler of the entire prison,

736
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,640
 even though he's an inmate.

737
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,900
 His faithfulness and his gifts and his talents

738
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,640
 bring him to a place where he gets to stand before Pharaoh.

739
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,680
 He gets out of prison, he goes to work for Pharaoh,

740
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,040
 and it says that Joseph was so faithful

741
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,480
 that Pharaoh put him over all of Egypt.

742
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,700
 Can I tell you something?

743
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,040
 God wanted Joseph to be over all of Egypt.

744
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
 Do you know what he did?

745
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,600
 He had him sold into slavery.

746
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
 God wanted Joseph to be ruler over all of Egypt,

747
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
 so do you know what he did?

748
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,260
 He had him sent to prison for something he didn't do.

749
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,680
 But Joseph never caved under the test.

750
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,560
 He continued to be faithful.

751
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,680
 And do you know the phrase that is repeated

752
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,560
 in Genesis 37, Genesis 39, Genesis 40, and Genesis 41?

753
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,200
 In four chapters, Joseph goes from slave

754
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,160
 to ruler of Egypt.

755
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,040
 And do you know the phrase that is repeated

756
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,240
 over and over and over in those four chapters?

757
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
 It's this right here.

758
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,400
 The Lord was with Joseph,

759
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,980
 but the Lord was with Joseph.

760
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,900
 And tomorrow, when you show up somewhere at 8 a.m.,

761
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,120
 the Lord is with you,

762
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,640
 and he wants to be invited into your occupation.

763
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
 He wants to come with you in the boat.

764
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,280
 He wants you to push out into the sea,

765
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,260
 and he wants to do work with you.

766
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,280
 And any success that he gives to you

767
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,700
 is so much more about him than it was ever about you.

768
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,880
 The worst thing that he could do for you

769
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,400
 is make you unbelievably successful,

770
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,320
 not attached to him.

771
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,000
 That is the worst thing that could happen to you,

772
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
 that he would fill your life with distractions

773
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,280
 when you have not attached that success to him,

774
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 that you would find yourself in a place isolated

775
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,920
 and with a dying faith, moving away from him.

776
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 But sometimes what he does is he brings attention

777
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
 through his servants to himself

778
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,780
 so that he might make his name famous through you.

779
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,040
 Joseph knew that the success that he was given

780
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,240
 had so much more to do with God than him.

781
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,960
 This idea will keep you humble

782
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,740
 because you understand that it is the Lord

783
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,340
 who makes you successful.

784
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,480
 Peter's here saying,

785
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,560
 "Hey, I didn't catch a bunch of fish because I'm good.

786
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,640
 "I caught a bunch of fish because Jesus is with me.

787
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,880
 "My boat right now encompasses the creator

788
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
 "of the heavens and the earth.

789
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,340
 "He's in here with me.

790
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,520
 "He commands the fish where to go.

791
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,160
 "He's God and he's with me."

792
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,880
 Peter later wrote in a book in your Bible

793
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,880
 called 1 Peter 5-6, he says this to us.

794
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,460
 "Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand

795
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,520
 "that he may lift you up in due time."

796
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,440
 Humble yourself therefore under God's mighty hand

797
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,400
 that he might lift you up in due time.

798
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,680
 And so if you find yourself in a place

799
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,400
 where you're not passionate about what you do,

800
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,240
 the third thing I want you to consider

801
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,340
 is pursuing a greater passion.

802
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,560
 In fact, my third point,

803
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,600
 my third instruction for you this evening

804
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,280
 is to pursue a greater passion.

805
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,080
 Now what do I mean by that?

806
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,600
 I want you to pursue what God is passionate about.

807
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,660
 You're asking yourself the question,

808
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,580
 what am I passionate about?

809
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,500
 That's the wrong question.

810
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,360
 The right question is what is God passionate about?

811
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,080
 What does God wanna do in and around me?

812
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,120
 And am I being as faithful as I possibly can

813
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,360
 to bring about his will in this environment?

814
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,160
 What is God passionate about?

815
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
 See, if you're just thinking about catching fish,

816
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,760
 you're thinking too small.

817
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,400
 Jesus is about catching people.

818
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,320
 If all you think about is a paycheck and a promotion,

819
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,480
 you're missing your real purpose.

820
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,740
 If all you think about is a paycheck and a promotion,

821
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,980
 you're missing your real purpose.

822
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,460
 God has a much bigger purpose for you.

823
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,640
 And so when you're asking, what am I passionate about?

824
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,460
 He's saying, no, would you focus on what I'm passionate about

825
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,480
 and if you're here and you're a follower of Christ,

826
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,360
 I hope number one on the list, really high on the list,

827
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,400
 is I'm passionate about Jesus.

828
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,200
 I'm passionate about a man who lived

829
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,720
 and lived a perfect life, unprecedented,

830
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,940
 and died a perfect death and he did so

831
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,520
 because I'm a pervert, he did so

832
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,680
 because I've done some terrible things,

833
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,520
 he did so because I'm materialistic,

834
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,440
 he did that for me, he came back from the grave

835
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,060
 and if I've trusted in that, he's given me a promise

836
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,320
 of eternal life forever and ever and ever and ever

837
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,200
 and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever with him.

838
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,320
 And I'm really passionate about that.

839
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,640
 I hope that, I mean, I hope that you have a response

840
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,960
 in your heart to that, that you say,

841
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,820
 I'm passionate about that.

842
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,980
 I want the world to know about an amazing God

843
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,180
 who offers eternal life forever and ever and ever

844
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,900
 and our biggest problems pale in comparison.

845
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,140
 One day he's gonna wipe away every tear

846
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,020
 and give us a new kingdom to live in.

847
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,500
 I'm passionate about that.

848
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,200
 Are you passionate about that?

849
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,640
 I'm asking, man, are you passionate about that?

850
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,420
 Colossians 3 verse 22 says,

851
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,160
 and slaves, it's not a racial slavery, okay?

852
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,480
 The most modern translation to this would say employees.

853
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
 Employees obey your earthly masters,

854
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,300
 earthly employers in everything and do it

855
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,980
 not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor,

856
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,180
 but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.

857
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,100
 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart

858
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,420
 as working for the Lord, not for humans

859
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,340
 since you know that you will receive an inheritance

860
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,220
 from the Lord as a reward.

861
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,260
 It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

862
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,540
 He says you're not working for your boss that you hate,

863
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,940
 you're working for an amazing boss, a perfect boss,

864
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,300
 an incredible boss who has you there in his sovereignty.

865
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,540
 He placed you there, literally placed you there,

866
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,940
 very strategically put you there.

867
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,340
 Acts 17 verse 26 says that he's determined the place

868
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,100
 and the time that you live.

869
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,580
 You've got to believe this,

870
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,140
 that God determined the place and the time

871
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,300
 that you live and that you work.

872
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,400
 One day I had a job I hated.

873
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,140
 I was doing door-to-door sales to businesses.

874
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,860
 It was in Dallas, I was at Industrial Boulevard.

875
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:45,380
 It was August, triple digit heat temperature that day.

876
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,460
 I had on a wool suit, which let's just all agree was stupid.

877
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,620
 And I walked in to a business,

878
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,500
 said no soliciting on the door.

879
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,020
 Lady behind the counter,

880
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,100
 "Ma'am, may I speak with whoever makes decisions

881
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,300
 "on your telecommunications?"

882
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,860
 She looks at me, Satan encompassed her.

883
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,900
 And she said, "Get out."

884
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,700
 I said, "Yes, ma'am, I understand, but listen, ma'am."

885
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,540
 "Get out, get out, get out."

886
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,020
 I'm like, "Okay, I'm out."

887
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,020
 And I walked out drenched in sweat.

888
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,660
 I'm angry at a lot of things.

889
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,740
 I'm angry at the job.

890
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,860
 I'm angry at God that has me at the job.

891
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,280
 And I'm really angry at that lady.

892
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,380
 I want to burn her house down.

893
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,140
 And so I'm walking angry.

894
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,380
 I didn't say it was a great moment,

895
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,620
 but I'm walking angry.

896
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,020
 And so I'm walking, I'm working,

897
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,980
 and I'm working the concrete.

898
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,060
 She's walking, I'm so mad.

899
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,460
 And I didn't even see this air conditioning unit

900
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,820
 sticking out of a brick wall about six feet high.

901
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,980
 I didn't see it.

902
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,660
 Walking, just hating life, hating that woman.

903
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,500
 Catches me in my temple right here, okay?

904
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,640
 Spins me around, fall to my knees,

905
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,320
 and I'm staring at the concrete.

906
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,180
 That is until a pool of blood fills the concrete

907
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,620
 and I begin to stare at my own reflection.

908
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,960
 [congregation laughing]

909
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,240
 And I'm taking this as confirmation

910
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,120
 that this is not where God wants me.

911
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,640
 I'm like, God just spoke through an AC unit out of a wall.

912
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
 He does not want me in this job.

913
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,260
 And I'm like not in a good place, okay?

914
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,280
 Like I'm not healthy at this moment.

915
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,800
 And I look up and across the street,

916
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,100
 there's a Burger King.

917
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,680
 It's amazing.

918
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,320
 I hadn't eaten at a Burger King my entire life.

919
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
 I'm like, there's the answer to all my problems.

920
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,600
 So I walk across to that Burger King

921
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,880
 and I walk inside and at this time,

922
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,840
 in Burger King's marketing campaign,

923
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,880
 they were selling a brownie, a warm brownie.

924
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,040
 I go up to the kind gentleman behind the counter

925
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
 and I said, I would like that with some ice cream on it.

926
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,120
 He tried to tell me they didn't put ice cream

927
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,960
 on the brownie.

928
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,700
 That is until that same demon that was in that woman

929
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,820
 possessed me in that moment.

930
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,140
 And I let him know there was gonna be ice cream

931
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,860
 on that brownie.

932
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,900
 I got the brownie.

933
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,180
 I sat down at a table for two

934
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,760
 and I began to eat my brownie.

935
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,820
 And think about how much I hated my job with every bite.

936
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,380
 I look up and there is a man sitting at my table.

937
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,940
 I am dead serious.

938
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,220
 He looks me in the eyes and he said, having a bad day.

939
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,560
 (congregation laughing)

940
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,520
 I said, sir, you don't even wanna get into it.

941
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,440
 Well, I gave it away with a big gash in my forehead

942
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,080
 or the way I'm eating the brownie.

943
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,240
 He said, what's wrong?

944
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,360
 I said, man, I don't know.

945
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,640
 He proceeds to begin to share the gospel with me.

946
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
 I wave him off.

947
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,720
 I'm a Christian, Christ follower, believer.

948
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,560
 I mean, you wouldn't believe it

949
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,200
 by the way I just acted, but I am.

950
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,600
 (congregation laughing)

951
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,400
 And he says, so what's wrong?

952
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,880
 What's up?

953
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,280
 I said, man, I just don't know what I'm supposed.

954
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,080
 Now I'm talking to this counselor at my table.

955
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,920
 I'm like, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

956
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,120
 This is completely normal for some reason in this moment.

957
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,680
 I'm like, okay, I'll tell you.

958
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
 You wanna know.

959
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,420
 I hate my job.

960
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,760
 I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.

961
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,560
 God has gone silent on me.

962
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,800
 And he goes, do you have any unconfessed sin in your life?

963
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,680
 I'm like, did my mom send you here?

964
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,520
 Like what?

965
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,120
 (congregation laughing)

966
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,640
 No, no, I don't.

967
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,120
 I'm in a small group.

968
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,960
 I'm in community.

969
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,800
 We talk, no, I mean, no unconfessed sin in my life.

970
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,760
 He goes, oh, I know what you're supposed to be doing.

971
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,680
 I go, oh, here we go.

972
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,920
 Charismatic guy over here.

973
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,960
 He's about to say a word for me.

974
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,260
 He's about to prophesy over me

975
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,720
 or tell me something amazing.

976
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,080
 Okay, what is it, sir?

977
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,640
 What is it I'm supposed to be doing?

978
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,160
 And he said this.

979
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,420
 He said exactly what you're doing.

980
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,160
 And didn't like that very much.

981
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,920
 You know, I'm like, you can see what just happened, bro.

982
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,440
 And he just said, you know, I know a little bit about God

983
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,440
 and I know he's in control of where we're at.

984
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,880
 And this morning you woke up in this job.

985
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,080
 And so I'm quite confident

986
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,880
 this is exactly the job God wants you in.

987
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,240
 And I'm confident that he wants you

988
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,600
 to bring glory to him in this job.

989
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,840
 And so I don't know you well enough to know

990
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,760
 if there's some things that you can change

991
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,900
 about the way you're doing this job to do that better.

992
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,200
 But I know that that's his will for your life.

993
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,800
 And then he disappeared.

994
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,920
 No, he didn't disappear.

995
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,260
 [congregation laughing]

996
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,820
 And this is, I mean, I've told this story.

997
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,180
 This is one of those stories that the Lord just gave me.

998
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,040
 I honestly believe in my heart of hearts to pass on to you.

999
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,400
 I believe that moment was more about you

1000
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,580
 than it was me even.

1001
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,720
 I'll always tell that story,

1002
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,000
 probably for the rest of my life

1003
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,440
 until the Lord takes me to be with him

1004
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,960
 because it's just unexplainable how those events happened

1005
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,080
 that he put this follower of Christ in my path

1006
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,680
 in just that moment to tell me that message.

1007
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,040
 And I believe it's a message for you

1008
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,640
 as much as it is for me, is the Lord put you where you are.

1009
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,620
 I don't know you well enough to know

1010
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,680
 if you're living out his purpose there.

1011
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,640
 I don't know if you can do it better.

1012
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
 You need to be asking those questions.

1013
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,960
 You need to be asking God,

1014
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,240
 "Lord, is there someone here you want me to share with?

1015
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,160
 "Is there a way I can be bolder?

1016
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,240
 "God, am I leveraging the gifts and the talents

1017
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,500
 "that you've entrusted to me?

1018
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,980
 "Father, am I thinking too much about myself

1019
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,280
 "that is driving me to a place of despair

1020
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,480
 "so that I'm missing your purpose here?"

1021
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,640
 Because I believe God is sovereign.

1022
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
 I believe he placed you where you're at.

1023
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,120
 And I just want you to believe that.

1024
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,960
 My favorite verse in the scripture is this.

1025
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,520
 It's Titus, I'm sorry, favorite verse on the topic.

1026
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,040
 Titus 2, verses nine and 10,

1027
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,920
 teach slaves, employees, to be subject

1028
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,600
 to their masters, employers, in everything,

1029
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,780
 to try to please them, not to talk back to them,

1030
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,960
 and not to steal from them.

1031
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,240
 And you're like, "Not to steal from them?

1032
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
 "I don't do that."

1033
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,320
 That's like, hey, are you looking

1034
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,240
 at social media on company time?

1035
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,260
 Are you showing up late?

1036
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,100
 Are you leaving early?

1037
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,520
 Are you taking long lunches?

1038
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,020
 Let's put that in the stealing from them category.

1039
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,640
 Work hard, don't steal from them.

1040
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,640
 But to show that they can be fully trusted, that's you,

1041
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,520
 so that in every way they will make the teaching

1042
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,100
 about God, our Savior, attractive.

1043
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,200
 The reason I have you there is so that you can work hard,

1044
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,560
 so that you can make the teaching

1045
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,200
 about God, our Savior, attractive.

1046
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,320
 You see that?

1047
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,400
 This passage does not condone slavery.

1048
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,040
 It condones a hard work ethic.

1049
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,780
 And so stop following your passions in and out of job.

1050
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,560
 To understand why we work, we must have a biblical worldview

1051
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,680
 on the reason for work.

1052
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,560
 There's four reasons you work.

1053
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
 Number one, for provision, so that you can provide

1054
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,780
 for yourself and for your family.

1055
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,160
 Number two, to be generous,

1056
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,360
 so that you can be crazy generous.

1057
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,320
 The world would look at you and say,

1058
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,680
 "Why does she give more than she keeps?

1059
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,000
 "Why is she so generous?

1060
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,060
 "Why is she always willing to help?

1061
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,880
 "How does he give that much away?"

1062
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,600
 To be generous, to improve your God-given talents,

1063
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,440
 that you would stay in a place and develop the talents

1064
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
 that God has entrusted to you,

1065
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,840
 even when you don't feel like it,

1066
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,940
 even when you don't wanna do art anymore,

1067
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,160
 that you would continue to develop those God-given talents.

1068
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,120
 And then lastly and most importantly,

1069
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,720
 to minister to others, to make Jesus famous.

1070
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,080
 And so stop following your passions

1071
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,360
 and form a greater passion for making Christ famous.

1072
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,720
 There's no greater cause.

1073
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,380
 You can give someone a drink and save their day,

1074
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,260
 or you can share Christ and save their forever.

1075
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,300
 Give someone a coat and make them warm,

1076
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,060
 or share Christ and help them be an heir to a kingdom

1077
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,620
 forever and ever and ever.

1078
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,180
 There is no greater cause.

1079
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,440
 And so how important is passion?

1080
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,280
 I don't know.

1081
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,520
 Was Jesus passionate about carpentry?

1082
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,860
 I don't know.

1083
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,100
 I mean, I don't know if you've thought about this.

1084
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,940
 Jesus literally had a job.

1085
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,200
 I mean, there were days of his life,

1086
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,900
 he'd wake up and he'd hammer nails into wood,

1087
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,600
 and he would make things with wood.

1088
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,460
 That's what he would do day in and day out.

1089
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,300
 That was his occupation.

1090
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,060
 He was a carpenter 'cause his dad was a carpenter.

1091
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,120
 Was Paul passionate about making tents?

1092
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,900
 I don't know if he had a thing for REI or what,

1093
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,460
 but I think it was just a means to ministry.

1094
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,180
 Like he's just like, "Hey, I'm gonna make tents

1095
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,560
 "so that I can do my greater passion,

1096
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,460
 "which is making Jesus famous."

1097
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,580
 Was Peter passionate about fishing?

1098
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,620
 Until he found a greater passion, he was.

1099
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,820
 But when he found a greater passion,

1100
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,220
 he became the first leader of our church,

1101
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,060
 one of the greatest leaders our church has ever known.

1102
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,180
 And that's what God is calling you today.

1103
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,940
 He wants to get in your boat, man.

1104
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:15,300
 He wants to get in your boat and do work with you.

1105
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,300
 And so friends, if your vision for your work is too small,

1106
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,540
 if you can't see past promotions and paychecks,

1107
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,540
 past 401ks and W2s, God has a bigger vision for your work.

1108
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,060
 Your work is a vehicle that the gospel moves forward on.

1109
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,220
 It always has been.

1110
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,060
 The gospel moves into countries and into new places

1111
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,340
 and everywhere through our work.

1112
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,860
 Stop asking Jesus where you should go

1113
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,100
 and start asking him to go with you.

1114
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,300
 Stop asking Jesus where should I go

1115
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,620
 and start asking him to go with you.

1116
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,620
 See, the thing is, I can't go

1117
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,660
 where you're gonna be tomorrow.

1118
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,700
 I can't be behind that Starbucks counter.

1119
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,220
 I can't be behind the counter of that bank.

1120
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,940
 I can't be in that public school.

1121
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,340
 I can't be in that engineering firm

1122
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,660
 or that oil and gas company.

1123
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,700
 I can't be back there in that telecom building.

1124
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,340
 But God has you there.

1125
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,580
 And so in that moment,

1126
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,420
 I can't be there.

1127
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,100
 And so in summary, what do I do

1128
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,500
 if I'm not passionate about my job?

1129
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,180
 One, change your perspective.

1130
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,420
 Two, invite God into what you're doing.

1131
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,540
 And three, pursue a greater passion in making Christ famous.

1132
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,020
 Taught this message a lot.

1133
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,740
 And so rather than give you another illustration

1134
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,180
 from my own career,

1135
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,740
 I thought I would tell you about a friend of mine.

1136
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,540
 This was a porch leader.

1137
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,420
 We'll call him Adam.

1138
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,540
 You know, led a team here at the porch.

1139
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,900
 And Adam hated his job.

1140
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,660
 And I remember being in his life at this time

1141
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,620
 and as he just wrestled with his job.

1142
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,860
 And specifically the reason that he hated his job

1143
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,340
 is because his boss didn't like him.

1144
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,340
 And there were some really specific things

1145
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,860
 that his boss had done to show him

1146
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,500
 that she was not a fan of his.

1147
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,020
 And so he was like, "Hey, I'm out.

1148
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,820
 "I want to look for a new job."

1149
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,780
 And so he began that search.

1150
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,020
 And that brought him to a friend's company.

1151
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,060
 A friend had started with this company,

1152
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,500
 had hiring responsibilities.

1153
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,580
 This company was just kind of taken off

1154
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,340
 and he was making a bunch of money.

1155
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,860
 And so Adam would make a significant percentage more there.

1156
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,940
 He'd get to work with a friend.

1157
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,780
 He'd have more freedom.

1158
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,860
 He'd work less.

1159
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,700
 And so he begins to process this decision.

1160
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,740
 And so his buddy offered him a job.

1161
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,900
 And so he did what good church goers do.

1162
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,100
 He met with his community group

1163
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,300
 and he just said, "Hey, what should I do?"

1164
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,860
 And they processed the decision.

1165
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,700
 It didn't take them long.

1166
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
 They said, "No brainer, you should leave.

1167
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,540
 "It's more money.

1168
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,460
 "It's more flexibility.

1169
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,980
 "You're more passionate about it.

1170
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,300
 "It's getting to work with a buddy.

1171
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,460
 "This is a no brainer, done deal.

1172
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,580
 "You should go and do this, except one man."

1173
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,340
 That one man was the same guy I talked about last week.

1174
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,220
 I said he was the wisest man I've ever met.

1175
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,860
 He's an elder here.

1176
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,820
 And he said this and it blew my mind.

1177
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,340
 He said, "Whoa, show me where the Bible says

1178
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,300
 "to take a job because you make more money."

1179
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,180
 He says, "Hey, can somebody chapter and verse

1180
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,540
 "where it says, 'Hey, you should take a job

1181
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,540
 "'with more flexibility.'

1182
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,200
 "Hey, that you should leave the job

1183
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,260
 "where God has you for a new job.

1184
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,420
 "Can somebody help me see that in the scripture?"

1185
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,360
 Now I'm like, "Whoa, he's gone off the deep end.

1186
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,000
 "This is simple.

1187
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,560
 "We don't need to make this a big deal.

1188
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,760
 "He has the freedom to look for a new job."

1189
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,400
 And he goes, "I think he's running from something,

1190
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,580
 "not to something.

1191
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,140
 "I don't know that the Lord has opened this door to me.

1192
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,260
 "It's not clear and I don't know that he's living out

1193
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,480
 "his purpose at his current job."

1194
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,300
 Now listen, Adam, to his credit,

1195
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,700
 in a way that I don't think I would have had

1196
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,900
 the spiritual maturity to do,

1197
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,700
 Adam listened and Adam stayed there.

1198
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,180
 And what's crazy about that

1199
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:03,460
 is one day he saw something in his boss

1200
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,020
 that she was kind of struggling and he went up to her

1201
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,860
 and he just said, "Would you just please, would you please?

1202
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,900
 "I don't know if we, we don't seem to be well,

1203
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,580
 "but would you come to church with me?"

1204
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,300
 And she said, "I will."

1205
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,140
 She came to church with him here to this place.

1206
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,000
 She rededicated her life to Jesus.

1207
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,180
 The Holy Spirit comes in and softens her heart.

1208
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,380
 Now her son begins to struggle with some life decisions.

1209
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,260
 She doesn't know where to turn to, so she turns to Adam.

1210
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,160
 Says, "Hey, will you help me?

1211
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,400
 "We're going through some family challenges."

1212
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,020
 Adam begins to minister to her family through her,

1213
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,580
 this lady that he was gonna leave

1214
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,340
 because she didn't like him.

1215
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,540
 And God changed the whole situation,

1216
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,460
 gave him favor there and began to use him as work.

1217
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,280
 Why?

1218
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,940
 Because he changed his perspective.

1219
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,660
 He asked God to come to work with him

1220
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,180
 and he began to live for a greater passion.

1221
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,140
 And that's not all.

1222
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:04,900
 His buddy's job, it didn't do so well.

1223
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,200
 It became a chaotic, corrupt environment.

1224
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,680
 There were lawsuits.

1225
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,200
 His friend was wrongfully terminated.

1226
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,120
 It became a very, very toxic environment

1227
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,440
 and would have been a complete curse had he gone there.

1228
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,100
 And no one saw that, not anybody,

1229
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,920
 not a room full of counselors,

1230
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,140
 but one man armed with God's word said,

1231
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,440
 "Hey, wait a minute, guys.

1232
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,740
 "Are we processing this based on passions?

1233
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,740
 "Are we processing this based on God's purpose for us?"

1234
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,080
 And that pause made all the difference.

1235
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,120
 Now, I know you got questions

1236
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,200
 running around your mind right now.

1237
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,400
 I know everybody in the room's saying,

1238
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,760
 "But wait a minute, when can you leave a job?"

1239
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,840
 [congregation laughing]

1240
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,200
 Like, are you saying I gotta stay here forever?

1241
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,080
 You know what?

1242
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,440
 I don't think God called me into vocational ministry.

1243
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,720
 And God clearly called me into vocational ministry.

1244
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,000
 If you know my story, it was very clear.

1245
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,520
 I don't think he did until I was already doing ministry.

1246
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,620
 I think he waited.

1247
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,960
 I think he waited until I began to see

1248
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,380
 past my own narcissism, past my own passion,

1249
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,860
 past my own desires, until I was a place

1250
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,660
 where God, I'm gonna do your will wherever I'm at,

1251
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,920
 be it here or be it anywhere.

1252
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,760
 And then he said, "You're gonna come work for me."

1253
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,120
 But what he's saying to you tonight

1254
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,760
 is you're gonna come work for me.

1255
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,340
 Maybe not at a church, maybe at Starbucks,

1256
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,740
 but you're gonna come work for him.

1257
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,580
 Let me pray.

1258
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,820
 [pastor sighing]

1259
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:38,800
 Father, as we seek your desire and your word,

1260
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,280
 as we wrestle with where we're gonna show up tomorrow,

1261
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,160
 as we wrestle with the people that you've placed

1262
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,860
 in our life to minister to,

1263
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,580
 God, would you give us the confidence that you're with us,

1264
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,160
 that you're at the desk with us,

1265
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,360
 that you are using us right where we are

1266
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,640
 and that you've placed us there.

1267
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,120
 That's what I'm asking you for, Father.

1268
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,160
 You don't have to give it to us.

1269
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,760
 You're God, we're not, but would you please consider

1270
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,680
 just giving us a piece as we sing this song

1271
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,680
 that we are exactly where you want us,

1272
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,260
 just like you told me on that day through your servant.

1273
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,460
 Would you just affirm in us that we are right

1274
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,300
 where we need to be?

1275
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,940
 And Lord, if you would, would you show us why?

1276
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,560
 Would you help us know why?

1277
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,520
 Father, thank you.

1278
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,680
 It's an honor to serve you there, here, and everywhere.

1279
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,840
 We worship you now.
