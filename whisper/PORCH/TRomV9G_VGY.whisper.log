[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   >> Let's sing it together.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   >> Where can I go from your spirit?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Where can I hide from your face?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Where can I flee from your presence?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Where would I go? Where would I go?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   If I fall to the depths of the sea,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   even there it's your hand that will lead me
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   wherever I go, wherever I go.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Wherever I go, you go with me, you go with me.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Father, and Lord you search me.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   How you know me.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   You perceive my every thought from afar.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   In all my wandering, still you love me.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   King of glory, you pursue my anxious heart.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Even when I'm not your faithful,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   even when I doubt your truth holds,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   even when I'm lost, you won't let me go.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And when my heart is dry, your grace flows.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   No matter where I run, I'm not far from home.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yeah, I may be weak, but you're able.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Even when I'm not your faithful,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   your faithful.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Even when I'm not your faithful,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   like a good, good father,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   yeah, you're faithful.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And every season, even when I'm not your faithful.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And where can I go from your spirit?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Where can I hide from your face?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Where can I flee from your presence?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Where would I go, where would I go?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   If I fall to the depths of the sea,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   even there it's your hand that will lead me.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Wherever I go, wherever I go.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Sing that again.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And see, where can I go from your spirit?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And where can I hide from your face?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And where can I flee from your presence?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Where would I go, where would I go?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   If I rise to the heavens, you're with me.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   If I fall to the depths of the sea,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   even there it's your hand that will lead me.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Wherever I go, wherever I go.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Even when I'm not your faithful,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   even when I doubt your truth.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Even when I'm lost, you won't let me go.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh, Father, no, you won't let me go.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   When my heart is dry, your grace flows.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   No matter where I run, I'm not far from home.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, I may be weak, but you're able.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Even when I'm not your faithful,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   your love's gonna find me in every season.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   When I'm not your faithful,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   your grace's gonna find me in every season.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Oh, you're faithful.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   This I know, this I need.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   When I'm not your faithful.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Oh, you're faithful.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   For you knew my history,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   and yet still you adopted me.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   With all of my baggage,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   still you claim me as your own.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Now I'm home in the love of the Father.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I belong in the heart of the Father.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I belong in the love of the Father.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And I'm coming back, coming back, oh.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I'm coming back to where I belong.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Will you got there to you?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Ooh, I'm coming back to you.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I'm coming back to you.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I'm coming back to you.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You're my first love.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That is who you are.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   God, you're my first love.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That is who you are.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I've tasted and I've seen,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and nothing else can satisfy my heart.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   No, nothing else can satisfy my heart.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So I'm coming home, I'm coming home.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So now I'm coming, I'm coming back to you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Hear your children.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I'm coming back to you.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You receive me as I am.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I'm coming back to you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Broken as I am.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I'm coming back to you.
