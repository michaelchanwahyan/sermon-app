[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.020]   - Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.720]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.040]   Come on, come on, it's great to be with you.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.520]   We are continuing a series called First Comes Love,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.860]   and I thought I'd start with my proposal story, okay?
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.760]   How I propose.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.460]   You know us, right, ladies lean in,
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.080]   do that fast clap, you know?
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.480]   And so here it's, you know, prepare yourself.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.900]   Here's what was going on.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.040]   I was dating a young lady named Monica,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.160]   and it was going places, so I thought.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.880]   And I was sitting there and I'm like, you know what?
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.840]   She's my best friend's sister, and I love her family,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.600]   and I don't think, you know, breaking up's gonna
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.680]   go well for me, so maybe I should get married.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.960]   And I was like, man, if you're gonna get married,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240]   isn't that romantic?
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000]   If you're gonna get married, you gotta buy a ring.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.640]   In the United States of America,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.840]   the way that we do this culturally is you buy a rock.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.120]   And I didn't know much about buying a rock,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.600]   so I start kinda brushing up on my diamond knowledge,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.920]   and I decide, you know what?
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.660]   I don't know if we're gonna get married next week,
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.280]   next month, next year, but sooner or later,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.160]   I'm gonna need a rock, and so I might as well
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.240]   pull the trigger on this.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600]   And so I'm gonna buy an engagement ring,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.400]   and so I go where everybody goes to buy an engagement ring.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.440]   I go to eBay.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   And I'm on eBay, and I'm looking at the engagement rings,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.720]   and there's one that has, it says in the description,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.760]   it's appraised for $23,000.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.480]   And the next thing you could bid on this auction was $1,600.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.540]   So I bid, that was about my budget, so I bid $1,600,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.340]   and I just go on about my life.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.560]   And then I go and check my email like a week later,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.180]   and it says you won this auction.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.940]   I'm like, what auction?
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.260]   Like, what did I win?
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.820]   Oh, crud.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.620]   And so I call the guy.
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.460]   There's an 800 number.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.280]   It's a reputable.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.980]   He's got a good feedback rating,
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.860]   reputable company in New York City.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.700]   I call him.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.520]   I'm like, hey, I won the auction.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   I won the ring.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.480]   He's like, oh yeah, I can't sell you that.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.760]   I'm like, no, it's a no-reserve auction.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.600]   You have to.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.800]   I won it.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.720]   And he's like, no, we go back and forth.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.080]   You can't sell me the ring.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.920]   I won the ring.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.740]   You gotta send it to me.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.040]   It's a legal binding bid.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   Send me the ring.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.680]   And I wasn't a believer.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.960]   I probably used some choice words.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.800]   And so I just kind of, we get off the phone,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.360]   and I paid, I sent the money, PayPal and all that,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.320]   and I hear something outside in my apartment complex,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.460]   and I open the door, and my outdoor apartment complex,
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.620]   like in the outdoor hallway, there's sitting a little box,
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.140]   and I'm like, they just left it outside?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.080]   I get it, and I open it up, and I'm like,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.460]   there's no way this thing's real.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.500]   There it is, this beautiful little piece of ice.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.060]   It's right there, sparkly and pretty and all,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180]   and I'm like, there's no way this thing's real.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.280]   And so I go straight to the jewelry store,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520]   you know, and I give it to the jeweler.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.360]   I'm like, hey, can you see if this thing's real?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.160]   And he like hooks it up to some machine,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   and he's like, yeah, it's real.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.720]   I'm like, hey, can you tell me what it's worth?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   And he's like, no, I need to send it off to do that.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.480]   I'm like, what do they do to send it off?
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000]   He says, it's the four Cs.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.200]   I'm like, well, what are the four Cs?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.040]   He says, well, they're gonna look at the color,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.960]   the cut, the clarity, and the carat, how much it weighs,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.480]   and that's what they're gonna do
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.080]   to determine that it's worth.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.340]   And I'm like, well, I don't have time for that.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.060]   I put the ring in my pocket, and I had to wake up.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.700]   My girl's graduating, and I'm like,
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.220]   I think I just got my graduation present, you know?
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.380]   I had some brand new golf clubs for her,
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.300]   just in case, you know, a backup plan.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.900]   She didn't even play golf, but.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.620]   I got a good deal on some women's golf clubs.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.820]   And so I was like, all right,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.860]   some golf clubs or an engagement ring.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.060]   We go down there, and you know, I'm a pagan idiot,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.380]   if you know me, I'm not walking with Christ at this time.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.620]   And we go down there, and we party,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.500]   and I drink too much, and almost get in a fight.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.580]   And here's the deal I didn't propose.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.580]   By the grace of God, I did not pull that ring
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.040]   out of my pocket, because if I would've pulled
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.100]   that ring out of my pocket, she would've said yes,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.160]   and it would've been a disaster.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.460]   It would've been a nightmare.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.260]   In fact, there were a lot of people in our lives
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.460]   at that time saying, hey, you guys should break up.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.300]   Two people specifically in our lives at that time
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.580]   just said, hey, you guys are a disaster,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.540]   you're manic highs, manic lows,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.280]   you guys shouldn't be getting married,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.100]   you shouldn't propose, y'all shouldn't even be together.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.420]   And so what I wanna talk about
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.820]   for the next few minutes together is,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.740]   ladies, how do you know he loves you?
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.540]   How do you know his love is genuine?
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.640]   One day you're gonna care about the four Cs of a rock,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.940]   the color, cut, clarity, and carrot.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.180]   I wanna give you five Cs to determine
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.780]   if a man's love is genuine.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.060]   Five Cs to inspect.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.980]   Men, if you're here, don't tune out.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.260]   This is five Cs that you can know and understand.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.220]   Are you at a place where you might pop the question,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.020]   where you might drop the L bomb?
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.140]   These are the questions that we're gonna cover tonight
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.600]   is how do you know if his love is genuine?
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.020]   Men, what does leading look like in dating?
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.500]   How do you know when it's time to pop the question?
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.000]   Or like I said, say I love you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.660]   How do you know if you feel like there is,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.380]   or I'm sorry, what do you do if you feel like
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.020]   there is no chemistry or no prospects
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.060]   to have chemistry with?
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.860]   And so girls, I know that, I don't know if you know this,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.620]   but you guys can be a little schizophrenic
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.260]   in what you want from us, okay?
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.940]   Yeah, you're like, I want him to be strong but gentle.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.460]   I want him to be courageous but sensitive, you know?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.980]   I want him to be fun but serious.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.540]   How do you be fun and serious, you know?
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.780]   Give us a break, you want us fun or you want us serious?
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.620]   Who do you want, right?
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.980]   I've come to the conclusion
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.780]   that you don't know what you want.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.940]   And tonight I'm gonna tell you what God wants for you.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.820]   From the scriptures, we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.100]   if you know anything about the Bible,
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.220]   this is the chapter on love.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.760]   Paul's writing to a church in Corinth
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.660]   that has misunderstood what love is,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.140]   so if you're in a place where you've misunderstood
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.500]   what love is, this letter's for you.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.260]   And he's going to tell us plainly,
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.060]   hey, this is genuine love.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.700]   And he says something a little later on
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.940]   that makes me think he's talking about
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.380]   the way a man should love.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.580]   And so that's what we're talking about.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.160]   How do you know if he loves you?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940]   1 Corinthians 13, verse one.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.160]   If I speak in tongues of men or of angels,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.900]   but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.740]   or a clanging cymbal.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.620]   This is a verse that's been often misunderstood.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.960]   It's simply saying this.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.260]   If someone comes and they says all the right things,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.340]   'cause ladies, no offense, but sometimes
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.740]   you guys are suckers for just the right words.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   Like a fella can, a guy can woo you
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.380]   with just a little bit of a game.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.020]   Don't fall for that.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.120]   And he's saying, hey, he comes in and he's winsome
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.780]   and he knows exactly what to say
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.220]   and he's saying lines that you tell
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.180]   and all your friends are cheesy,
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.360]   but in reality you go home and you feel so swooned.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.440]   He said, hey, it doesn't mean he loves you.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.700]   It could just be words.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.540]   It could just be words.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.740]   And then he says it's like a gong.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.740]   You know, it comes on fast and hard and heavy
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.460]   and you feel all these things.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.540]   He's like, it's like, oh!
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.560]   But it fades.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   He gives us this picture.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.480]   Of love.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.380]   It's like this.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.720]   (loud gong)
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   It's loud.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.800]   And heavy.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.400]   And emotional.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.380]   And gone.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.440]   It's beginning to fade the second it starts.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.040]   It will not last.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.800]   You've got to look past the words.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.520]   If I have the gift of prophecy
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.660]   and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.960]   and if I have faith that can move mountains,
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.880]   but do not have love, I am nothing.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.540]   He may be really smart and wise and have a great job.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.900]   He may have went to med school.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.980]   He may have graduated summa cum laude.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.380]   I don't know, right?
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.220]   But if the brother can't love you, keep going.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.620]   If I give all I possess to the poor
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.480]   and give over my body to hardships that I may boast,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.700]   but do not have love, I gain nothing.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.460]   He's saying something really key here.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.880]   He might go to Haiti.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.120]   He might serve the widows and the orphans.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.020]   He might have memorized scripture.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.320]   It doesn't mean he knows how to love you.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.340]   You're going to have to inspect something else.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.020]   So what do you inspect?
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.200]   We're gonna go five C's, you ready?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.960]   The first one, okay, is he cherishing?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   Can he cherish you?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.480]   This is the first C.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.880]   Paul is going to continue to talk about genuine love,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.840]   and he says in verse four, love is patient.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.920]   Love is kind.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.020]   What does it mean that love is patient?
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.080]   Despacito.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.060]   That ain't what it means.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.300]   That ain't what it means.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.960]   Is he weight on you?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.840]   Does he weight on you?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.000]   Does he care for you?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Is he constantly walking in front of you,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.800]   hurrying off, men, can you hear me?
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.140]   Lean in, brother.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.800]   Chivalry's not dead.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   Okay, these are God's daughters, your sisters.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.540]   You care for them.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.540]   My dad used to tell me, if I was ever with a girl,
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.480]   and he said, if you ever walk in this house first,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.320]   you're gonna go back outside and stay outside.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.000]   And you know, that stayed with me,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.340]   that you've gotta care for them.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.180]   That is your job.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.800]   God made us different, and he put you here
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.320]   to protect them, and to care for them,
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.840]   and to provide for them, and I know that gets lost
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.080]   in your modern culture and vernacular,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.120]   and the things that you're reading in the news,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.300]   but don't forsake this ancient book of eternal truth.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.760]   And ladies, I don't care if you're so hardcore
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.460]   and women's lib, and you're on your own,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.080]   and you're independent, I know there's something
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.720]   deep down inside of you that wants this.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.060]   You want a man to care for you.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.700]   You want that, I know you do.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.140]   I've talked to a lot of you.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.440]   So does he do this?
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.860]   Ladies, I gotta tell you this,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.740]   some of you, you don't think you're worth this.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.380]   And that's because you're getting your worth
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.920]   from somewhere other than Christ.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.480]   God has made you in his image.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.020]   He made them in the garden, male and female.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.740]   And ladies, you wait for a guy who will cherish you men.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.420]   Listen, I get asked all the time,
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.420]   what if there's not chemistry?
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.340]   What if I'm not physically attracted?
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.300]   Listen, here's the simple question, here's the answer.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.120]   You ready?
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.300]   I'm gonna answer it right now.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.340]   Can you, men, I'm talking to you men,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.000]   can you cherish her?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.200]   For the rest of your life,
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.960]   will you choose to cherish her,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.580]   treat her like a princess, make her feel beautiful,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.740]   make her the only object of your affection other than God?
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.920]   That she's the one you think about,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.980]   that she's the one that you're coming home to joyfully?
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.320]   Can you do that?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.820]   If you can, awesome.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.300]   If you can't, then communicate clearly that you can't
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.960]   and that this is not going anywhere.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.460]   Stop wasting time.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.760]   1 Peter 3, verse seven, it says,
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.480]   "Husbands, in the same way be considerate
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.660]   "as you live with your wives and treat them with respect,"
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.680]   it says, "to honor them as the weaker partner
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.740]   "and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.100]   "so nothing will hinder your prayers."
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.620]   It says, "If you marry a girl you don't cherish,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.380]   "your prayers won't be answered."
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.440]   That's high stakes, man.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.460]   If you marry a girl that you are not committed to cherishing
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.560]   God ain't listening.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.000]   And it's a challenge, guys.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.540]   It's not the work of boys.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.480]   The reason I didn't propose, by the grace of God,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   is 'cause I was a child.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.200]   I was a little boy.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.540]   This is not boys' work, 1 Peter 3, seven.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.280]   I was married just this week in marriage.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.060]   In fact, next week my wife and I
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.840]   will celebrate 13 years of marriage.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.000]   We've been married for 13 years.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.920]   Praise God.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   And I planned an amazing anniversary trip with her.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.060]   And so we were gonna go to Mexico.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.820]   I booked the resort, I paid for it.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.840]   This is where we went on our honeymoon.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.020]   And so I thought, hey, let's go back there.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.720]   It's gonna be awesome, I'm so excited, I'm pumped.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   And I'm closer, and she's like,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.240]   I'm feeling uneasy about Mexico.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.080]   I'm like, why?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   She's like, well, there's earthquakes.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.880]   I'm like, that's somewhere else.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.980]   She's like, well, there's hurricanes.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.120]   There's Jose, there's Maria.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.580]   I'm like, they're going other places.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.780]   She's like, well, there's, you know,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.660]   they're poisoning the alcohol.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.820]   I'm like, you don't even drink.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.160]   What's going on?
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.460]   And here's what's going on.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.460]   She's just as uneasy.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.820]   She's like, there's cartel violence.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.080]   I'm like, I'll protect you.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.260]   And,
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:18.680]   and as it got closer, we're leaving next week.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.520]   What she's saying is, hey, I don't wanna go to Mexico.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.560]   And what I promised her 13 years ago
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.820]   is I'll put your interest in front of my own.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.620]   I'll lay down my life to serve you.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.020]   And so in those disagreements,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.820]   there's the question I gotta ask is how can I serve her?
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.520]   So I called and I canceled.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.360]   I said, where do you wanna go?
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.560]   Let's go somewhere you wanna go.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.960]   Let's go somewhere there's no earthquakes
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.540]   and hurricanes and cartel, poisoned alcohol
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.820]   for those that do that, you know.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.720]   How can I put her interest in front of my own?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.420]   An easy way to know if a guy's patient and kind,
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.820]   he's gonna cherish you, it's the physical stuff, man.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.620]   It's the physical stuff 'cause here's the deal.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.860]   Like, if he likes you, then when he's with you,
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.320]   his body is going crazy and he wants you, you know,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.920]   like naturally in his flesh, he desires all of you.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.420]   That's how God made us, God made us.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.020]   And if that man restrains that,
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.480]   then you know he's communicating something beautiful to you.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.980]   Do not mistake that.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.920]   Ladies, especially those of you
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.080]   that have became Christians recently,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.220]   you know a lot of times when you come
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.820]   from immoral relationships, you're like,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.320]   does this guy even like me?
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.620]   Like, he doesn't touch me.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.820]   And that's a good thing, okay.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.620]   Do not mistake that as a bad thing.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.180]   You're not his, that's why he's not touching you.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.640]   You're God's daughter, that's why he's not touching you.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.480]   And so you put that in the positive category,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.340]   this man is patient, he's restraining,
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.980]   his natural carnal urges for you.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.980]   And if he doesn't, he's communicating something
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.540]   really clearly, it's a really clear communication.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.240]   He's saying, hey, I do not honor marriage
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.680]   and I'm committed to being physical outside of marriage
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.740]   and in fact, if I marry you, I will go outside
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.040]   that marriage because I don't honor marriage.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.680]   He's also communicating something else.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.100]   I don't fear God.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.280]   I'm not afraid of God.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.340]   I know that 1 Thessalonians 4, verse six
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.780]   says that we're not to be sexually immoral
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.380]   and it says that if we are, the Lord will punish
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.980]   all those who commit such sins.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.580]   And he's saying, hey, I'm not afraid
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.480]   that you're God's daughter.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.140]   I'm gonna do what I wanna do and I wanna do it,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.480]   I'm not patient with you, I'm not cherishing you.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.980]   Boyfriends do not get husband privileges.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.880]   Can you hear me?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.300]   Boyfriends do not get husband privileges.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.840]   And so ladies, does he cherish you?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.940]   Men, can you commit to cherishing her?
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.340]   Second C is we're inspecting his love.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.680]   Is it real, is it genuine?
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   The second C is is he confident, not conceited?
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.180]   The one that comes from the scripture
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.640]   is the one conceited.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.940]   Conceited is excessive pride in oneself.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.180]   Conceited is a fake version of confidence.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.940]   Conceited or conceit rather is the cubic zirconium
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.340]   of diamonds.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.940]   It's not real, okay?
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.040]   You're gonna have to really lift this one up,
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.380]   hold it to the light and expect it closely.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.780]   Is it confidence that comes from trusting a huge God
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.980]   that God is in control and sovereign over his life
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.840]   and has a plan and a purpose for him
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.980]   and is taking him somewhere?
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.080]   Is it that kind of Christ-centered confidence
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.340]   or is it conceited that says, hey, look at me,
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.940]   look at me, look at me, look at me.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.340]   It's about me, look, I'm gifted, I'm fast, I'm cute.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.980]   You know, I got a good job and a fast car.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.220]   Look at me, right?
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.720]   Is it conceit or is it confidence
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.020]   and you have to be able to discern the difference.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.380]   Conceit says look at me.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.380]   A Christ-confident man says look at him.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.740]   His life says look at him.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.520]   Confidence comes from trusting a big God.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   Conceit comes from feeding a big ego.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.520]   A man who is stuck on himself has no regard for God.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.400]   You went to high school with this guy, right?
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.340]   The arrogant guy.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.680]   You know, remember the arrogant guy?
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.000]   I remember the arrogant guy so well.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.180]   And what was frustrating about him,
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.840]   he was constantly stuck on himself.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   He walked around like a peacock, you know.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.780]   He had the bright red convertible car and I'm not angry.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.840]   And what really frustrated me then and a little bit now
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.080]   is he always had the beautiful girlfriend.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.000]   In fact, he would jump from one beautiful girlfriend
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.900]   to the next beautiful girlfriend.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.940]   He would treat them like trash.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.380]   And you're sitting there and you're scratching your head.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.520]   I mean, am I alone in this?
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.620]   You always wonder why the jerk, arrogant guy
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.620]   ends up with the sweet, pretty girl, right?
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.700]   Here's why.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.100]   'Cause she's also conceited.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.360]   And that's why she goes with him
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.740]   because he's an accessory to her.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.280]   And she's making an exchange.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.940]   She's okay if he treats her like trash
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.640]   because she thinks that she deserves that guy.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.620]   And so she's spending a lot of time putting on the makeup,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.620]   a lot of time in the mirror.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.700]   She's also vain.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.580]   Vain people find vain people.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.600]   It's just the way it works.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.380]   And that's the answer to why do they end up with the jerk?
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.980]   'Cause there's vanity there too.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.720]   There's vanity there too.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.820]   With genuine love, with genuine love,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.060]   selfishness turns to service and even sacrifice.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.380]   With genuine love, selfishness turns to service
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.860]   and even sacrifice.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.020]   And so if you sense, ladies, that he loves himself
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.220]   more than anything else, run as fast as you can.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.060]   You are looking for someone who loves Jesus more than you.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.180]   That is, more than he loves you and more than you do.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.280]   And so, ladies, if God has your heart,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.160]   if God truly has your heart,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.580]   you woke up this morning thinking about Creator God
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.780]   and his sacrifice through his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.180]   If that's what marks your life,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.580]   this man is gonna have to go to God for your heart.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.220]   And to go to God for your heart
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.980]   is going to take Christ-centered confidence.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.060]   But if he's conceited, he's not gonna be able
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.900]   to see God past himself.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.340]   He's gonna be too focused on him.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.100]   Do not believe the lies of the world
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.180]   that you want a guy like that.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.300]   You do not.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.740]   That will make a miserable marriage.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.860]   So the next C is controlled.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.940]   Is he controlled?
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.220]   Number three, is he controlled?
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.820]   Controlled by the Spirit.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.840]   Does he walk around with a chip on his shoulder
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.500]   from the baggage from his father or his ex-girlfriend
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.580]   or his upbringing or job loss or his boss?
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.800]   Is he just angry?
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.020]   Paul says in verse five,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.580]   "This kind of love is not easily angered.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.340]   "It keeps no record of wrongs."
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.120]   Anybody here know an angry scorekeeper?
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.420]   They're walking around with a tablet on their heart
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.180]   and they're just writing down all the people
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.940]   who have hurt them and they walk around
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.260]   and they're hurt and they don't understand
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   the forgiveness of Christ
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.620]   'cause they haven't forgiven others.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.220]   There's no joy in their life.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.580]   And if there is, it can quickly turn back to anger.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.220]   They're explosive and volatile.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.680]   And maybe you're like, well, he's not that way with me.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.220]   That's because you're interviewing
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.540]   or he's interviewing, right?
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.180]   You're right, he's not that way with you.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.060]   He's interviewing.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.660]   But if he's that way with others,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.860]   it's going to be that way at you sooner than you think.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.860]   It's going to happen if that sort of explosive anger, rage,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:43.220]   a lack of reconciliation, if that marks his life.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.700]   It says here in this text,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.480]   this love does not envy and it always trusts.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:58.060]   If he's jealous and controlling, constantly overbearing,
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.460]   this comes from a lack of trust.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.140]   The reason he has that lack of trust
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.220]   is because he's not trustworthy.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.740]   Speak from experience right now.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.100]   The reason he doesn't trust you
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.060]   is because he doesn't trust himself.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.540]   And it's not the controlled by the Spirit
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.980]   that we see in the scripture.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.460]   But let me hit a little disclaimer here.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.380]   'Cause every now and then I'll talk to girls
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.180]   and they're like, yeah, he's so jealous.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.740]   You know, like my best friend's a boy, a guy.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.880]   And you know, yeah, he calls me all the time
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.980]   and texts me late at night.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.160]   He just texts me good night every night, no big deal.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.980]   You know, yeah, my best friend's a guy,
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.820]   but he's so jealous.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.660]   That's weird.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:43.020]   Can I tell you something that really unpopular?
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.780]   You'd be tempted to be angry at this.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.460]   You were not meant to have a best friend
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.720]   that's the opposite sex.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.060]   You hear me?
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.740]   I'm serving some of you really well right now, okay?
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.040]   You were not meant to have a best friend
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.220]   who is the opposite sex.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.060]   God didn't make us that way.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.960]   Someone's heart is always drifting.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.580]   If you don't think so, you're being naive.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.240]   Most likely you're feeling an emotional void
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.420]   with that friendship.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.860]   And you don't even realize it.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.820]   Maybe it's subconscious.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.300]   But you were not made,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.300]   you never saw Jesus do this, right?
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   And man, Jesus, where's Jesus?
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   Oh, he's just hanging out on the boat with Mary, you know?
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.340]   Just catching fish, flirting, friendationship.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   It's all good.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.100]   That's not cool, man.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.300]   That's not right.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.660]   There's something wrong with that.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.780]   Some of you are so uncomfortable right now.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.220]   But I'm telling you,
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.120]   that wasn't the way, it doesn't match up with God's design.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.980]   Man and women were meant to come together.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.980]   That's God's design.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.240]   And usually a heart is drifting
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.700]   whether you know it or not,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.100]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.400]   And that's a red flag.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.980]   So it says here, to go back to that text,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.660]   it says, "He keeps no records of wrongs."
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   Is he keeping score?
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.500]   You don't wanna marry an angry scorekeeper.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.620]   Guys, if you're bitter all the time,
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.700]   you gotta get help, man.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.540]   I mean, just get help.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.360]   We're here for you.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.200]   We love you.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.220]   We wanna help you heal.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.220]   I've seen some really angry, vengeful guys
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.300]   find healing in Christ.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.140]   We can help you.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.340]   Just come up and ask for help, you know, if that's you.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.500]   Because here's the deal, man.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.220]   Kids are gonna come into the picture.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.020]   That dude is gonna be the disciplinarian.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.100]   He's gonna be spanking your babies.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.420]   And you don't want an angry man spanking your babies.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.420]   Man, you're not just interviewing for the role of husband.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.780]   You're interviewing for the role of father.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.300]   And you don't wanna take those daddy wounds
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.800]   and just pass them on, like a tall gene
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.700]   or something else, right?
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.920]   You want 'em to stop with you.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.300]   You want that to die with you.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.100]   And that takes work.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.940]   It takes a man.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.700]   It says, "Hey, I'm up for it.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.580]   "There's some undoing that needs to happen
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.080]   "in my heart and in my life.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   "I've gotta find some healing.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.100]   "I need help."
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.420]   We'll help you.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.320]   You're not alone.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.160]   The fourth C is a clear conscience.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.900]   Does he have a clear conscience?
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.540]   Paul's gonna say in verse six,
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.520]   is he cleansed by the truth?
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.760]   And then he says this other thing,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.260]   that this love that he's talking about,
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.180]   it does not delight in evil,
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.100]   but it rejoices with the truth.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.740]   So it doesn't delight in evil.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.460]   Some of us are entertained by the things
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.140]   that Christ died for, which is not okay, right?
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.300]   Some of you men here, you regularly invite,
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.620]   satanic influences in your life
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.140]   by what you listen to, what you watch,
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.300]   what you say, and what you look at.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.420]   Every day on the regular, weekly,
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.900]   you're saying, "Hey, Satan, come and influence
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.020]   "my heart and my mind."
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.300]   And you're so taken away from it.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.980]   You're so far down the current of culture in this,
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.900]   you don't even realize what you're dancing to,
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.180]   what you're bobbing your head to.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.900]   You don't even realize that the show that you can't miss
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.520]   is satanic in nature,
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.060]   that it's the things that cost Christ his life,
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.540]   that it's evil and wicked,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.500]   and that it's influencing your heart
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.340]   and it's training you to look for all the wrong things
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.220]   so that it will keep you single and desperate
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.140]   and discontent and depressed.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.140]   Nobody wants to be depressed,
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.220]   but so many people pursue depression
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.020]   by what they feed their minds and their hearts,
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.500]   what they listen to, what they watch,
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.260]   what they look at, what they say.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.980]   There's a,
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.660]   there's like in a diamond,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.620]   you can buy a cloudy diamond on the cheap,
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.220]   like if it's not bright and shiny,
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.180]   it's called included, inclusions,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.740]   and there are coal deposits in the diamond
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.900]   that make it cloudy, make the sun not bounce through it.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.340]   In the same way, if someone has evil influences
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.540]   in their life, their mind and their heart gets cloudy.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.740]   They're influencing you and leading you
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.180]   with a cloudy heart,
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.540]   and it's going to have a greater impact
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.580]   than anyone could imagine,
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.700]   and again, I say this from experience.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.860]   There's evil that a guy participates in
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.940]   that will cloud his thinking,
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.140]   and so what are some things?
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.020]   I just, like if you're drinking on the regular,
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.980]   like if you're getting drunk,
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.580]   if you look past this weekend,
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.740]   and you're the party guy, you're the weekend warrior,
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.020]   like you can't wait to get to the bar,
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.100]   you got your drink of choice,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.700]   like you're probably a future alcoholic,
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.420]   and that's just kind of the way that works.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.460]   You're becoming something.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.340]   You don't realize that the fun that you're having now
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.740]   is costing you something later.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.180]   It's probably costing you now, too,
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.580]   so this is something to inspect, right?
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.180]   If he likes to get physical now,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.860]   he's probably gonna be unfaithful later.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.660]   He's communicating something to you.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.700]   He's saying, hey, I'm willing to be physical
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.540]   outside of marriage.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.140]   I don't hold marriage sacred,
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.460]   and so you gotta know and understand that,
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.420]   and then this is a big one.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.180]   I want you to lean in for this one.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.300]   If he looks at pornography now,
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.460]   you're not gonna satisfy that man.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.900]   It's not an addiction to sex.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.540]   It's an addiction to variety.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.740]   No porn addict, I've talked to thousands,
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.500]   literally thousands,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.620]   no porn addict looks at the same picture
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.020]   over and over and over and over and over.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   You're training your brain not for monogamy,
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.540]   but for polygamy, polyamory,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.860]   for variety,
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.740]   and no woman here is gonna satisfy that man.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.740]   It's an impossible, sensational appetite,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.620]   and brother, listen, I know right now you feel so awkward.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.140]   You know in the past six months,
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.540]   maybe in the past six weeks,
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.700]   and maybe in the past six hours,
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.300]   you've looked at porn.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.180]   You need to get help.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.100]   You will not heal from this thing on your own.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.900]   Listen, I've done cocaine.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   I've done ecstasy.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.820]   I smoked weed every day for a long season.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.580]   I've never been addicted to anything
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.740]   or gripped by anything like pornography.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.300]   I thought I'd look at porn for the rest of my life.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.940]   You've got to get help,
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.380]   and it's work.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.020]   I'm not talking about a phone call
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.140]   or one confession's gonna heal you.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:42.980]   It's work.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.100]   Show up every Monday night here, 6.30 at Regent.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.420]   Listen, let me make this really clear.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.620]   I'm gonna make it binary for you
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.980]   so you can just kind of put yourself in my,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.580]   if you've looked at pornography in the past six months,
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.380]   I wanna see you here this Monday at 6.30
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.100]   and get help.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.540]   You gotta, I'm done.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.460]   You're done with it.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.660]   That thing is ruining your marriage
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.500]   long before you've met your prospect.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.900]   And it's, you know, ladies,
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   if you feel like guys aren't attracted to you
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.140]   or they're only like a certain kind of girl
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.020]   or no one's asking you out
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.180]   and you wanna blame something, blame porn.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.340]   Blame sin, blame Satan, blame pornography.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.380]   It's a big reason.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:35.740]   If that's your journey, I wanna tell you I'm so sorry.
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   I'm so sorry.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.420]   I don't know when you were exposed to it.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.380]   I don't know when it started.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.360]   I don't know when you looked at the first image.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.980]   I know it comes now through your phone
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.220]   and through the internet.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.820]   Man, I know what it's costing you.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.660]   You may not.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.060]   I do, I know oh too well what it's costing you.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.580]   I'm so sorry that you set foot on that path.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.380]   It is time to get off.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.200]   It is time to step off that road,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.640]   to end that journey and to get healing
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.480]   for the sake of your children,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.560]   for the sake of your wife,
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.720]   for the sake of your children's children.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   We need to spend more time rejoicing with the truth
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.040]   than delighting in evil.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.320]   And some of you, you spend more time listening to trash,
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.940]   watching trash and looking at trash
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.600]   than you do in God's word.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.880]   And it's no wonder that your mind is trashed.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.800]   It's no wonder.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.360]   It's a simple math problem.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.420]   I get this email every single week.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.260]   It's the same email.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.340]   I put it in a category.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.500]   And so if you're listening, I'm not talking about you.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.600]   I'm talking about hundreds and hundreds of you.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.300]   It kind of starts out, hey, JP,
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.900]   I need some relationship advice.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.740]   It's complicated.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.480]   It's always complicated.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.840]   That's the first paragraph.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.900]   And then it goes into these crazy nuance,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.860]   like listen, I like the beach and he likes the mountains
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.440]   and this and that and I'm this theology
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.340]   and I have this background and this and whatever.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.180]   And then it gets into, the third paragraph is usually,
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.180]   and lately, we've been physical
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.500]   and once I thought I was pregnant
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.900]   and then this happened and now this.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.900]   Or he's looking at pornography and this is where we're at.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.940]   And that third paragraph is usually the climax
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.900]   of the problem that's happening.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.260]   And then the fourth paragraph is usually what do I do?
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   And I always wanna respond with just a simple two words,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.020]   break up.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.540]   But I don't.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.020]   But I don't.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.060]   But I want to.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.660]   Because it's what you need to do.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.340]   And so I can be pastoral in my words
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.220]   and I can put some flowery language around it,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.300]   but in reality, you're not married.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.780]   And so you have the benefit of the ability
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.140]   to end a relationship that's not God-honoring.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.820]   And what you need to do is you need to break up
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.700]   and you need to get healing.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.540]   And if you guys, your path crosses,
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.620]   your believers later on, praise God for that.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.060]   But there's something so much bigger
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.620]   than your relationship, your idolatrous relationship.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.300]   There's another relationship that's so much more important.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.340]   In fact, this whole book,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.660]   like if this whole book is about a relationship,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.740]   the part that's about men and women, it's about that much.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.460]   The rest of it, that much of it,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.260]   it's about another relationship, one much more important.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.940]   Some of our lives don't say that.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.300]   Some of us hadn't talked to them in a long time.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.580]   Some of us hadn't spent an hour reading this book
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.420]   in a long time.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.980]   Some of you, you never have, not in your entire life.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.500]   Can I suggest a reprioritization?
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.820]   Make an investment in the marriage
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.260]   that you don't have today.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.820]   And begin to put God first, make Christ ultimate.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.980]   If your conscience is clear,
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:45.100]   however, 'cause we just talked about breaking up,
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.900]   if your conscience is clear,
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.180]   then it should lead to a commitment.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.220]   And that's the fifth C.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.780]   What's he committed?
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.620]   Does commitment mark his life?
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.820]   In verse seven, Paul is gonna use the word always a lot.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.900]   Verse seven, this kind of love Paul talks about,
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.740]   it always protects, it always trusts,
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:07.100]   it always hopes, it always perseveres.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.300]   Ladies, listen, if he's constantly trying to change you,
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.940]   he's not committed to you,
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.660]   he's committed to what he thinks
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.020]   he might be able to make you.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.820]   Marriage is not a strategy on changing someone.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.460]   You don't marry somebody
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.500]   hoping they're gonna become someone else.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.700]   You marry them with all their weird idiosyncrasies,
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.060]   their messiness, their uncleanliness.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.820]   In fact, I remember I dated a girl before Monica,
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.900]   and she would always go to my mom and she's like,
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.940]   "He's so messy," you know, 'cause I am.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.780]   And so disorganized and gross, you know,
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.380]   and we broke up.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.580]   And then I started dating Monica.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.700]   And my mom would be like,
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.820]   "Does it bother you that he's messy?"
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.820]   And she's like, "Eh, nah, doesn't bother me."
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.580]   And my mom said at that moment
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.820]   she knew Monica was the one for me,
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.060]   because she wasn't trying to make me somebody else.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.020]   She was gonna live with my craziness,
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.020]   and she has for 13 years, pray for her.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.260]   And she wasn't trying to make me someone else.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.020]   And so I'll turn that,
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.580]   'cause usually it's guys trying to change somebody.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.100]   Stop it, you've got a lot of options.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.260]   If you want someone else, choose someone else.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.900]   If you want the person that you're with,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.260]   then embrace who God made them.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.900]   I'm not talking about their sin struggles, right?
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.300]   I'm not talking about like,
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   that the Lord's not gonna sanctify them,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.540]   but don't make that your hope, right?
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.820]   Like if they don't change,
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.140]   you're not gonna love them forever.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.620]   That's not commitment.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.940]   Man, I gotta talk to you about something
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.180]   before we wrap up.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.660]   A huge part of being committed is communication.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.260]   Man, I need you to hear me on this one.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.060]   I need you to communicate clearly.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:02.540]   Communicate where this is going, what you hope in,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.740]   what you trust, what you're persevering in.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.580]   What leading looks like in dating is communicating.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.060]   It looks like certainly abstaining from the physical,
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.720]   that's a real test of leadership.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.980]   But the other aspect of leading in dating
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.780]   is communicating well, 'cause fellas,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.700]   let me tell you something.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.660]   Girls wonder about everything.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.420]   They wonder when you're gonna call back
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.220]   and what you're thinking and where this is going
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.500]   and are we even in a relationship and does he like me
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.940]   and when's he gonna call me again
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   and where's he gonna take me?
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.180]   They just wonder all the time.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.060]   And so if you wanna lead in a relationship,
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.420]   listen, leaders remove confusion.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.260]   Let me say it again.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.540]   Leaders remove confusion.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.460]   Don't let her wonder
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.080]   because you're clearly communicating.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   Men, listen, if you like her, say I like you.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.960]   If you, listen, listen.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.200]   Listen, listen, 'cause it gets better.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.180]   If you wanna go out with her,
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.880]   say I'd like to take you out.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.220]   Guys say, I'm like, I go ask her out.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.640]   They say, well, I don't know how.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.960]   Go up to her.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.720]   Look her in the eyes and like a man,
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.800]   you say, I would love to take you out.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.680]   It makes you vulnerable.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.020]   She may say no.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.380]   You're gonna be okay.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.160]   Tomorrow's gonna come.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.040]   It's gonna be great.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   Okay, it's all, all's gonna be okay.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.520]   You're gonna grow through it.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.380]   But you look her in the eyes and you say,
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.960]   I would love to take you on a date.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.800]   What I didn't say is messenger on Facebook
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.360]   or poker, whatever that means, you know.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.680]   Never do that.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.540]   Or listen, or text her.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.600]   It's like I tell my four-year-old
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.040]   who grunts and moans and whines a lot.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.700]   I say, listen, Weston, listen, use your words.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.560]   Use your words, men.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.180]   God gave you vocal cords.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.040]   Speak.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.240]   Communicate clearly.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.400]   Tell her where this is going.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.320]   I know some of you men, you're looking at me like,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.080]   like you want me to do what?
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.840]   You want me to speak to her?
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.800]   It's gonna be really important in marriage.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.600]   Listen, your marriage is gonna be defined
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.160]   so much more by the way you communicate
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.080]   than all the physical stuff.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.200]   I know that's crazy and mind-blowing right now.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.760]   I know that's crazy.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.880]   But listen, the physical stuff
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.040]   is not gonna ruin your marriage.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.140]   Communication will.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.280]   A healthy marriage is much more contingent
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.800]   on the way you communicate
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.740]   than how often you're having sex or being intimate.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.160]   Trust me, all you can do is trust me right now,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.460]   but one day, one by one, you will come back
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.920]   and say you were right, JP.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.280]   God was right when you were reading that.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.800]   One time I was, we went to Austin,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.480]   friend and I, and you know, we were partying there
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.640]   and we weren't walking with Christ.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.920]   And we were coming back and he was playing this dumb game
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.080]   where he wasn't putting his hand,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.720]   he was driving, but he wasn't driving.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.240]   He would put his hands down.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.800]   And I'm in the passenger seat and I'm like,
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   dude, hold onto the steering wheel.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.560]   You know, we're driving down I-35.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.800]   I'm like, drive the car.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.760]   And he's like, what, drive this car?
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.960]   I'm like, hey, that's not funny.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.320]   Drive the car, man.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.360]   Like, put your hand, 10 and two right now, come on.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.880]   And it's uncomfortable.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.240]   It's uncomfortable when someone's
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.920]   not committed to going somewhere.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.560]   Men, do you hear me?
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.840]   Like, let her know where you're going.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.080]   Drive, put your hands, 10 and two,
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.120]   and say, okay, hey, this is where I want you to know.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   This is what I'm thinking.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.360]   This is how I feel about it.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.800]   If you're like, well, I don't know, well, figure it out.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.320]   Take some time and get with God and journal
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.440]   so that you can tell her, hey, this is what's going on.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.480]   Is he committed?
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.000]   Is he committed to communicating clearly?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.920]   Is he committed to Christ?
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   Is he committed to the right things?
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.920]   Here's why, guys, why I would say drive somewhere.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.400]   'Cause you're dating.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.840]   And can I tell you a little secret?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.080]   Dating is awful.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   Like, if you think of singleness, dating, and marriage,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.120]   dating is by far the least fun.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.600]   By far.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.920]   Like, singleness, 1 Corinthians 7 singleness,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   Matthew 19 singleness, like singleness
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.640]   for the sake of the kingdom, it's awesome.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.000]   Like, you can jump on the train, you can go to,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.600]   train, does anybody take the train?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.200]   You can go to Africa, don't take the train.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.840]   You can go to Haiti, you know, you can go to Europe,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.920]   backpack through Europe, like, you're single, man.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.120]   There's so much things you can do.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.320]   You can risk your life for the sake of the kingdom
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.120]   when you're single in ways you can't when you're married.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.800]   But when you're dating, like, it's the interview.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.160]   You know, it's not fun.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.600]   Who likes the interview?
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.080]   Like, you go and you put on your power tie
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.960]   and you walk in and you present yourself
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.720]   and you're all vulnerable and then you go home
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.920]   and you're like, are they gonna call me back?
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.160]   I don't know, they said they would, I don't know.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.320]   You know, it's like, where's it going?
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.840]   Hey, did you hear back from, I haven't yet,
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.200]   but they said that, and you just sit
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.280]   in this vulnerable spot, that's dating.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.600]   Like, it's fun, like, when you get the job, that's fun.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.280]   Okay, now, okay, we're committed to each other.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.880]   That, now we got something.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.240]   Dating is awful.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.360]   Like, stop believing the world, like, it's a new category.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.520]   It's not even in here.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   You know, we invented it just to punish ourselves.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.280]   Right, it's not fun.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.320]   And so, get the show on the road.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.800]   Like, I'm a huge fan of dating for a little while,
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   short engagements, get married, have babies, make disciples.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.600]   Heard it here first.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.200]   It's like marriage, marriage is buying,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.440]   dating is shopping, dating without the intentions
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.000]   of marriage is shopping with no money.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.320]   And what's gonna happen when you shop with no money?
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.720]   You're gonna leave frustrated, or you're gonna take
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.080]   something that didn't belong to you.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.640]   But those are the only two outcomes.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.060]   So, the only reason that we date is because God gave us
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.740]   the gift of marriage, and we're trying to get there.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.540]   If you don't wanna be married, don't date.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.340]   Be single for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.180]   If you're like, I don't really wanna be married right now,
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.620]   cool, then you don't wanna date right now.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.020]   It's the only reason we date, is to get married.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.860]   All right, I've meddled.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.220]   What I need some of you guys to hear tonight,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.620]   and I say this with a pastor's heart, a shepherd's heart,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.020]   'cause I love you, and the same way I wanna respond
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.700]   to that email breakup, what I need some of you
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.540]   to hear tonight is grow up.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.580]   Stop being a boy.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.400]   It's time to become a man.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.580]   Paul says this, "When I was a child, I talked like a child.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.280]   "I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   "But when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me."
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.300]   And so, ladies, boys might be fun for a date,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.600]   but they make miserable husbands.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.900]   You need a man.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.540]   You need a 5C man, a man who will love you
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.140]   like God has called him to love you,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   one who will cherish you, who's not conceited, but committed,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:41.460]   one who's going to care for you like this passage says.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.940]   And so some of you, you're like, well, where are they?
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.340]   I mean, I don't know any men like that.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.180]   Do they exist?
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.620]   Let me show you something, okay?
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.060]   Here's a little chart, okay?
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:58.060]   There are 3.72 billion men, 3.72 billion, 3.72 billion.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:03.100]   That's what that represents.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.300]   Of those men, guys who are 20 to 35 and single,
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.100]   so porch goers, right, porch going age,
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.740]   20 to 35 and single, there's 312 million of those men.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.580]   Of the 312 who are 20 to 35 and single,
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.100]   of those men, 31% call themselves Christians.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.020]   It's about 101 million.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.020]   Of that number that calls themselves Christians,
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.260]   by our very best estimate,
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.260]   30 million of them are following Jesus.
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.180]   30 million of them are running hard after Christ.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.020]   30 million of them are 5C men.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.380]   And so the bad news is there's only 30 million.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.060]   The good news is there's 30 million.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   30 million, but you've gotta weed through the 3.72 billion.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.260]   How are you gonna do that?
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.860]   Five Cs, all right?
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.100]   Can he cherish me?
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.900]   Is he conceited?
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.740]   Is he controlled by God's spirit?
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.140]   Does he have a clear conscience?
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.100]   And is he committed to the right things?
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.500]   And you might be like, man,
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.980]   I just feel like nobody's asking me out,
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.100]   like I'm being overlooked,
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.740]   that guys only are attracted to a certain kind of girl,
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.460]   and you're tempted to be despair
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.780]   that there's no good guys,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.060]   and you feel like you've been left behind,
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.340]   lots of you nodding your head,
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.700]   like yes, that's how I feel.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.140]   Listen, thank the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.620]   Thank God that he's kept away all those others
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.660]   that are not attracted to the things
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.860]   that God's attracted to.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.580]   That has so much more to do with the man
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.340]   that's your maturity than anything else.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.140]   And so don't despair, thank God that he's protected you
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.220]   from marrying somebody whose heart he does not have yet.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.420]   And use your singleness to go back
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.820]   and listen to that message from a few weeks ago.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:13.100]   It's not super practical, the five Cs.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.340]   You're like, but how do I know?
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.740]   Do I ask him on the first date?
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.620]   Hey, can I, will you cherish me?
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.580]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.500]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.820]   You know, date number one, are you committed to this?
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.020]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.260]   Here's how you know.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.340]   It's a bonus C.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.460]   It's his life built on Christ.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.300]   If his life is built on Christ,
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.180]   then you're gonna know it.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.180]   Like another thing that girls will say is like,
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.820]   when do I tell him that I'm saving myself for marriage?
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.220]   Or, you know, how do I know if he's this guy?
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.260]   I'm like, man, way before the first date.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.620]   Like I wouldn't spend any time with anybody
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:01.940]   who you do not know that their life is built on Christ.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.620]   Because you know what, here's what happened, guys.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.820]   I didn't propose by the grace of God
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.540]   on that day when we went to Waco.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.180]   What happened is I came back to Dallas
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.620]   and someone invited me to a church.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.140]   Man, I was so consumed myself, narcissistic.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.180]   I was a mess, but I stumbled into a church.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.060]   And I began to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.100]   that my pornography addiction, my cocaine use,
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.500]   my partying, my drinking, my clubbing, my abuse of women,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.620]   that Jesus died for that.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.460]   It was this amazing message that captivated my heart,
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.440]   that God sent his son, that he loved me so much,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   that he gave his Weston, his Jesus, to die for my sins.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.220]   And he defeated death, he raised him from the dead,
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.940]   and my heart got around that message
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.420]   that I didn't have to pay for my sins
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.680]   because someone else did.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.220]   That was great news to me.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.300]   I submitted my life to that Christ.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.580]   I said, Jesus, listen, I don't wanna drive anymore.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.860]   I've driven in and out of bad relationships.
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.340]   I've driven to destruction.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.220]   I've driven to addiction.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.460]   I've driven to hurts, habits, and hangups.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.740]   Jesus, you drive.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.460]   You created the world, you made me,
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.340]   you gave me purpose, you drive.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.080]   And what happened is he came in my life like a flood,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.220]   like a hurricane, and he began to turn things upside down,
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.860]   he began to deal with that addiction,
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.780]   he began to deal with the hurts, the habits, the hangups,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.140]   he introduced healing, and he changed me
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.180]   from the inside out.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.020]   The physical stuff between Monica and I was done.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.620]   We sat down, said, hey, I don't think
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.700]   we should do that anymore.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.060]   She said, I've been telling you that.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.740]   I said, I'm so sorry, you have.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.620]   I haven't been listening.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.020]   I've been doing what I wanna do.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.300]   I haven't been patient or cherishing.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.380]   I've been self-centered and conceited.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.500]   Will you forgive me?
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.780]   I'm committed to pursuing Christ with you.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.820]   He's changed my life.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.060]   We started going to church together.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.160]   That was our new date.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.200]   He changed everything, and you know what happened?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.260]   I realized dating wasn't very fun.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.500]   I'm like, hey, man, dating's like all the challenges
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.340]   of marriage and none of the benefits.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.340]   I was sitting at dinner with her
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.340]   and another couple that said a year before
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.260]   that there's no way we should even get married,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.780]   much less date or anything.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:25.020]   I got down on one knee, and I handed her a rock
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:30.340]   because our lives were built on the rock of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.820]   We had been talking about Jesus.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.100]   We had been celebrating Jesus.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.100]   We had been sitting at that table with that other couple
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.580]   talking about all the things that Jesus had done
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.060]   in our lives, how he had healed us and what he had done.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.420]   So I got on a knee and I handed her a rock
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.740]   because our lives were built on the rock.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.140]   And that couple that said we shouldn't be dating
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.220]   a year earlier, they stood up and they applauded,
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.700]   and the rest of the restaurant applauded,
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.460]   and our friends and our family applauded that love.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.020]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.940]   That's what you want.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.420]   If you're here and you wanna be married,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.420]   inspect the five C's.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.780]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:18.300]   God, we know that what matters most is not the rock
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:23.180]   that we exchange, but the rock our life is built on.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:30.540]   So God, would you help my friends here tonight,
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.660]   even tonight, starting tonight for some of them,
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.760]   build their life on the one you sent to pay for their sins.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.080]   God, would you heal the marriage that hasn't even begun?
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.760]   Would you heal the hearts of husbands and wives
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.000]   that haven't even met?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.800]   God, would you work to restore what the enemy
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.280]   has sought to destroy?
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:00.480]   And Father, would you help these men cherish women
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.160]   to be confident in you, not conceited,
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.000]   to be controlled by your Holy Spirit,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.280]   to have a clear conscience that rejoices in the truth,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.680]   not delighting in evil,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.160]   help them to be committed to the right things.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.720]   In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
