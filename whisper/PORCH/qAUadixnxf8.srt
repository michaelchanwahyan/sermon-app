 [CHEERING]

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,640
 What's up, Ports?

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,400
 How we doing?

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,480
 [CHEERING]

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,080
 Greetings, Dallas.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,120
 Greetings, Fort Worth and Houston.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,800
 And if you're listening around the world,

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,040
 we're so glad you are.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
 So excited about what God is doing

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,280
 through the lives of 20 and 30-somethings.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,400
 I'm so excited that so many of you

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,160
 are not wasting your life chasing the American dream,

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,560
 and that we can gather like this around God's word,

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,160
 and that the Spirit of God can speak to us and change us

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,640
 and make us new and give us hope for eternity.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,240
 And so what a blessing it is to worship with you guys.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,160
 My name is JP.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,320
 If you're a guest with us, it's great to meet you like this.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I hope to meet you afterwards face to face.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
 And I'll tell you a little bit about myself.

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,320
 I have, since I was little, since I was in junior high,

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,160
 I've always loved wrestling.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,280
 I've loved to wrestle.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
 You get with your boys, like, hey, let's wrestle.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
 And so I've always loved that.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,960
 And I am a like below average wrestler at best.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,560
 But when I came to work here at Watermark,

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,400
 we hired this guy named Brandon Slay.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
 And so Brandon and I met and we became friends.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
 And then we worked together here

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,480
 because Brandon had a heart for vocational ministry.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,960
 He wanted to give his life to advancing the gospel

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,080
 and building the kingdom.

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
 Well, the unique thing about Brandon Slay

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
 is he's an Olympic gold medal wrestler, okay?

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,120
 And so that, here's what that means in case you don't know.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,600
 It means he's the best in the world, the best in the world.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
 Like there is no one better than this man.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,560
 He is one in a billion good or even more than that.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,520
 And so he goes to launch with us,

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,720
 just to give you a for instance,

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,200
 he goes to launch retreat with us.

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
 And this guy's like, hey, Brandon,

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,720
 you know, I wrestled in high school, let's wrestle.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
 Brandon's like, you sure?

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
 You know, he's like, yeah.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,320
 And so they're just playing around.

49
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,640
 But Brandon's an athlete, an Olympic athlete at that.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,960
 And so he has no 50%, he has no half speed,

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,360
 he has no kind of go slow mode.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,840
 And so he just like first, like he jumps down, pops up.

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,160
 And on the pop up, hits my friend,

54
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,880
 breaks his ribs, punctures his lung.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,440
 We got to take him to the hospital.

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,280
 His lungs 90% deflated.

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,400
 Like I didn't know, I was like, no, go back and play.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
 You'll be fine.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
 Lo and behold.

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,440
 And so for some reason, I don't know, pray for me.

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,080
 I was like, hey, Brandon, I'd like to wrestle sometime.

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
 I know, stupid.

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,040
 And so we go and we get on the mat,

64
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,560
 'cause I'm thinking like I'm a big guy, you know.

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,760
 And I've got a picture of him if you want to see.

66
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
 There he is.

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 And he's a big guy, but not, but he, you know,

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,160
 five, eight, something.

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,800
 And so we get on the mat and like, I just,

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
 I remember like, man, there is something

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
 super human about you.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,520
 Like he did whatever he wanted to do.

73
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,120
 And I almost died.

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,360
 And so I'm sitting there like after 15 minutes,

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,440
 so true story, first contact, he's just like,

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
 kind of does one of those and like pops a vertebrae

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
 out of place.

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
 I'm not kidding.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,320
 I think about him every single morning of my life

80
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
 'cause my neck still hurts.

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
 I'm not kidding.

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,320
 And so then we wrestle 'cause I didn't know better.

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,760
 And 15 minutes, I just want to throw up all over the place.

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,920
 I've done nothing.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,800
 And he's still smiling like, man, show me some submission

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
 moves or something.

87
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,320
 I'm like, dude, come on, what are we doing?

88
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,080
 And here's what I remember thinking.

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
 Like this guy is so powerful.

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,160
 It was just like this, this wake up call,

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,560
 like the chasm between he and I is infinity big,

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
 like so enormously big.

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,720
 He is so much more powerful than me.

94
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,000
 And the same kind of wake up that I had in that moment

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,680
 is what the disciples are gonna have in this story,

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,400
 this evening.

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,880
 It's this realization that this rabbi that we've chosen,

98
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,880
 oh, wow, he is so much more powerful

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,760
 than we ever could have imagined.

100
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,240
 The same way that I felt about Brandon,

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,080
 they felt infinitely more so being with Jesus.

102
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,440
 And so this evening, we're gonna look at the power

103
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,040
 of Jesus over evil.

104
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,860
 We're gonna be in Mark chapter five,

105
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,800
 if you wanna turn there.

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,200
 Because I think this is so important for us this evening,

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,880
 because for so many of you, if you grew up in the church,

108
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,560
 when you think about Jesus,

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,320
 you might picture him like this, right?

110
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 It's effeminate Jesus.

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,360
 Sometimes he's throwing up the deuce.

112
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,040
 Sometimes he's holding a pet lamb, you know,

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,300
 got wavy flowing permed hair.

114
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,240
 And if you're anything like I was,

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,760
 like you're sitting there overwhelmed by sin,

116
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,520
 like materialism owning your life,

117
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,240
 pornography for me, sexual addiction for me,

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
 like me kind of going through this world,

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
 searching for significance,

120
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,480
 reaching for anything that I can,

121
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,280
 all of these hurts, habits, and hangups.

122
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
 And I'm like, that guy ain't gonna help me.

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,960
 Like the thing that I'm enslaved to,

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
 it's so powerful and it's owning me.

125
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
 And I need something stronger than it.

126
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,920
 And I don't know if it's him.

127
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,360
 And I want you to know,

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
 he is infinitely stronger

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
 than whatever is gripping you right now.

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,840
 Infinitely stronger.

131
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,280
 So if you're gonna fight something stronger than you,

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,800
 you need to find something stronger than it.

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,200
 And he's just the man for the job.

134
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,440
 I wanna show you that in the text this evening.

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
 We're in a new series we started last week called AD.

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
 AD is just an abbreviation,

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,080
 it's medieval Latin for Anno Domeni,

138
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,240
 which means literally translated the year of the Lord.

139
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,200
 The Lord in that is Jesus Christ.

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,040
 It was the year of the Lord Jesus Christ

141
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,640
 and they shortened it to AD.

142
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,800
 Here's what that means.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 Today, 2016, we are counting 2016 years from BC.

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,920
 That means before Christ.

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,800
 God shows up on the scene in the form of Jesus Christ

146
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
 and he reset the calendar.

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,160
 And it's the calendar that we use

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,760
 and that most of the known world uses.

149
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,300
 It's the calendar that your Microsoft Outlook uses,

150
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,880
 your iPhone uses.

151
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,160
 They count from Jesus's birthday.

152
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,720
 That's significant.

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,280
 And so we're in this series looking at the year of the Lord,

154
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,120
 interactions with Jesus.

155
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,760
 And tonight we're gonna look at the objective of the enemy,

156
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,960
 Jesus's power over the enemy,

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,040
 and the objective of Jesus.

158
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
 And if I haven't sucked you in yet,

159
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,820
 we're gonna talk about some demonology this evening.

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,600
 And so maybe that will intrigue you.

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,800
 And so to set this up, in Mark chapter four,

162
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,200
 Jesus, he's in Capernaum, he's hanging with his boys

163
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,460
 and he's like, let's get on a boat.

164
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,560
 Now this is significant

165
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,480
 because boats didn't have motors at this time.

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,280
 And so to go across the Sea of Galilee was quite the feat.

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,840
 Jesus is sleeping in the boat and a storm comes.

168
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
 And this storm is significant

169
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,200
 because these fishermen by trade,

170
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,160
 people who had lived on that Sea of Galilee,

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,260
 they're terrified.

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,100
 They're so afraid.

173
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,920
 They wake Jesus up.

174
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560
 They're like, do you not care about us?

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,960
 Look at what's happening.

176
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
 And it's this comical scene.

177
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,840
 Jesus gets up and is like, hush.

178
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,840
 I mean, wind stop, seas calm.

179
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,620
 And it says about the disciples that they were terrified,

180
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,820
 not of the storm now,

181
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,800
 but of this man that they had led in their boat.

182
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,940
 They're like, oh wow, he's more than a rabbi.

183
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,580
 The wind and waves obey him.

184
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,920
 And Jesus is on a mission.

185
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
 He's going across the Sea of Galilee.

186
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
 I was just there months ago on the same sea

187
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,340
 where Jesus is in a very similar boat

188
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,660
 to the one that he's on.

189
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,440
 And he gets off the shore

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,940
 and we'll pick up in Mark chapter five, verse one.

191
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,180
 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.

192
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,800
 When Jesus got out of the boat,

193
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,020
 a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.

194
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,140
 Do you see that?

195
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,740
 There's a man who lives in the tombs

196
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,560
 and he's walking to meet Jesus.

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,940
 He's coming to him.

198
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,380
 This is the showdown.

199
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,620
 This is the face off.

200
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,000
 Let me tell you about the man

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,840
 because the next few verses are gonna go out of their way

202
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,100
 to show you how bad this dude is,

203
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,340
 how strong this dude is.

204
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,860
 This man lived in the tombs

205
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,620
 and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.

206
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,300
 For he had often been chained hand and foot,

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,780
 but he tore the chains apart

208
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,320
 and broke the irons on his feet.

209
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,460
 No one was strong enough to subdue him.

210
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
 Night and day among the tombs and the hills,

211
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,240
 he would cry out and cut himself with stones.

212
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,880
 Shows up in three gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

213
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,440
 And in Matthew and Luke, it says the people avoided him.

214
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,580
 They were afraid of him.

215
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,820
 The people feared him.

216
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,780
 This guy is terrifying.

217
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,520
 He's strong.

218
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,500
 There's nothing that can hold him.

219
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,740
 It goes to great details to show you this.

220
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,220
 And I would tell you that

221
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,100
 I've been wrestling with this text this week.

222
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,540
 I believe this man exists.

223
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,840
 He might be in some other part of the city

224
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,640
 that you don't go to often.

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,780
 He's sitting under a bridge.

226
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
 Maybe he's roided up out of his mind.

227
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,620
 He's strong.

228
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,580
 He's depressed.

229
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,180
 He's addicted.

230
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,660
 He's breaking beer bottles and cutting himself.

231
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,540
 He's a cutter.

232
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,020
 He's streaming out in pain.

233
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,700
 And we don't care.

234
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,700
 We don't care.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,940
 We pass by him.

236
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,780
 We turn the other way.

237
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,020
 Jesus says, "Boys, get in the boat.

238
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
 "I got work to do."

239
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,880
 And he goes out of his way to find this one man.

240
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,420
 And the text tells us two things about him.

241
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,980
 It says he's a slave and he's strong.

242
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,880
 He's a slave in that he's abandoned.

243
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
 He's naked.

244
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,540
 He's bound.

245
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,380
 He's bleeding.

246
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,060
 He's crying out and he lives among the dead.

247
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,180
 He lives among the tombs.

248
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,960
 But the enemy's given him a benefit.

249
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,220
 He's strong.

250
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,980
 He's strengthened.

251
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,180
 And I don't know if he's aware

252
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,380
 of his spiritual state or not,

253
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,660
 but I can see this guy as being this

254
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,700
 really wealthy real estate mogul,

255
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,140
 this young entrepreneur who's stacked up cash for himself,

256
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
 bought properties, has cars,

257
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,980
 has a lot of things going for him.

258
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,380
 He's strong and completely blind

259
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,060
 to the evil he's involved himself in.

260
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,480
 So my first point this evening

261
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,860
 is the objective of the enemy.

262
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,820
 I want you to know the objective of evil,

263
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,020
 the objective of Satan,

264
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,660
 his game plan for you tonight as you sit there.

265
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,180
 He has one objective.

266
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,420
 That's to make you a slave to anything other than Christ.

267
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,900
 To make you a slave to anything other than,

268
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,940
 to relationships, to identity in relationships,

269
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,540
 to anorexia, to bulimia, to pornography,

270
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,980
 to self-righteousness, to legalism,

271
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,500
 to make you a slave to following the rules,

272
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,440
 make you a slave to your work.

273
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,900
 Now he will never come to you and is like,

274
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,840
 hey, you want to make a deal?

275
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,980
 I'm going to make you a slave to your work.

276
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,800
 But what he will do is give you a little bit of success

277
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,940
 and feed something in you,

278
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,580
 a search for significance in you.

279
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,060
 So that you find yourself in a place

280
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,060
 where you will sell out everything for success, for success.

281
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,860
 He wants to make you abandoned, bound, bleeding, crying out,

282
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,660
 partying among the dead.

283
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,580
 Says no one could bind him anymore,

284
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,660
 which means they once could, verse three.

285
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,020
 Says no one could bind him anymore.

286
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,880
 What's interesting about that

287
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,580
 is once they could tie him up,

288
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,340
 once they were strong enough to bound him.

289
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,720
 But this guy, he's grown violent and strong and angry.

290
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
 I've talked to these people.

291
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,060
 They come up and they're so given to their sin

292
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,700
 that they react violently, they act angry,

293
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,420
 and everybody's moving away from them.

294
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,180
 Everybody's shrinking back from them.

295
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,260
 They've been so given to the evil,

296
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,400
 so handed over to the desires of their heart.

297
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,340
 Because when you feed something, it grows.

298
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,940
 Whenever you feed something, it grows stronger.

299
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,220
 It's the lie of the one last time.

300
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,660
 I'm gonna look at porn one last time.

301
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,980
 No, that one last time strengthened that desire.

302
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,500
 I'm gonna masturbate one last time.

303
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,300
 No, that one last time fed something in you,

304
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,780
 an appetite that now is stronger.

305
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,180
 I'm gonna call him one last time.

306
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,380
 No, that one last phone call fed a desire of your heart

307
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
 that is now stronger.

308
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,660
 It's the lie of one last time.

309
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,980
 Sin leaves you lonely and hurting,

310
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,820
 but it might offer a benefit, in this case, strength.

311
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,300
 And the benefit could be blinding.

312
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,620
 Look at how strong I am.

313
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,840
 Look at how beautiful I am.

314
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,820
 I know I'm anorexic.

315
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,060
 Look at, I get to experience so much pleasure.

316
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,380
 I'm addicted to pornography,

317
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,180
 but there's so much pleasure there at my will.

318
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,260
 Whenever I want it, I know that I'm an addict to shopping,

319
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,140
 but look, I have style, not to mention debt.

320
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,180
 So it offers this benefit, but it's enslaving.

321
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,360
 My friend got back from Turkey last week,

322
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,500
 and she came over last night,

323
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,940
 was meeting with my wife, Monica,

324
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,580
 and she brought us and the children

325
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,060
 something called Turkish Delight,

326
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,660
 which if you've heard of Narnia,

327
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,540
 the lion, witch, and the wardrobe,

328
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,420
 that is something that is in the movie.

329
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,260
 It's evidently a real thing.

330
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,500
 I didn't know, but in the movie,

331
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,540
 and I'll just tell you the plot.

332
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,380
 You need to see it.

333
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
 It's an excellent movie.

334
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
 It's also a book if you prefer reading.

335
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,220
 And so Edmund, right, he gets,

336
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,620
 the witch feeds him this thing called Turkish Delight,

337
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,140
 and he eats it and he tastes something.

338
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,620
 He wants more of it and he wants more of it,

339
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,460
 so much so that he gets to a place

340
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,300
 where he will sell out everyone around him

341
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,460
 just to consume a little more.

342
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,500
 Sounds like a meth addict.

343
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,940
 Sounds like a heroin addict.

344
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,660
 Sounds like the rich young ruler,

345
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,740
 the man or the woman in uptown, midtown, West Seventh,

346
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,460
 that just can't get enough.

347
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,620
 Wants a little bit more and a little bit more attention.

348
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
 Right?

349
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,460
 See, when you begin to entertain the proposition of sin,

350
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,860
 sin is just an invitation to worship

351
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,140
 something other than Jesus.

352
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,980
 Write that down.

353
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,020
 Sin is just an invitation to worship

354
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,100
 something other than Jesus.

355
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,060
 And when you do that, you invite the possibility

356
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,300
 of becoming a slave to something other than Jesus.

357
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,380
 When you entertain that worship

358
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,700
 of something other than Jesus,

359
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,500
 you invite the possibility of becoming a slave to it.

360
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,580
 And I've seen this.

361
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,140
 It's funny when it's an allegory in Narnia,

362
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,660
 but I had a dear friend of mine

363
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,460
 who lived in uptown above a bar in a high-rise condo

364
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,620
 dating a swimsuit model.

365
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,300
 He's a financial advisor, a stockbroker,

366
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,440
 and everything is going right in the world,

367
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,060
 and he's living for the party.

368
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,960
 And he was in the church,

369
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,420
 but all of a sudden he leaves the church.

370
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,200
 He stops having time for church.

371
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,380
 He's spending time with his friends, time with his girls,

372
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,260
 and pushes everyone out of his life that loves him,

373
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,220
 anyone that would speak truth to him.

374
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,520
 When his family came to town, he was too busy to see them.

375
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,460
 Abandoned, hurting, but doesn't see it,

376
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,040
 doesn't realize it,

377
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,900
 and pushed everyone away who loved him.

378
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,660
 Verse six, "When he saw,"

379
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,900
 so this showdown's happening, the man is there.

380
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,340
 It says he's coming to Jesus, okay?

381
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,460
 This man who no one could subdue, everyone feared him.

382
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,620
 "When he saw Jesus from a distance,

383
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,340
 "he ran and fell on his knees in front of him,

384
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,100
 "and he shouted at the top of his voice,

385
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,700
 "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

386
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,120
 "In God's name, don't torture me."

387
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,580
 What?

388
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,020
 There's no lightsabers.

389
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,300
 There's no duel.

390
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,220
 There's no sparring.

391
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,860
 He falls down, which is the position of worship,

392
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,660
 and he attempts an exorcism.

393
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,940
 Do you see that, what happens in an exorcism?

394
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,500
 "In the name of Jesus Christ, I, in the name of God, I,"

395
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,940
 he says, "In the name of God."

396
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,700
 Don't hurt me.

397
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,780
 Don't hurt me.

398
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,620
 There's no dualism.

399
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,500
 Dualism is a heretical theology

400
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,780
 that there's God versus evil.

401
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,620
 There's no good versus evil.

402
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,980
 There's no God versus Satan.

403
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,140
 They're not dueling on this even platform,

404
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,460
 and God's trying to know his moves, right?

405
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,060
 God is sovereign over Satan.

406
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,800
 It's crazy, it's mind-blowing.

407
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,100
 "For Jesus said to him,

408
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,340
 "'Come out of this man, you impure spirit.'

409
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,260
 "Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?'

410
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,200
 "'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for we are many.'"

411
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,420
 Verse 10, "And he begged Jesus."

412
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,580
 He begged Jesus again and again

413
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,360
 not to send them out of the area.

414
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,200
 He begs him.

415
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,960
 "A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.

416
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,600
 "The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the pigs.

417
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,540
 "'Allow us to go into them.'

418
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,180
 "He gave them permission."

419
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,000
 Underline that word.

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,260
 "He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out

421
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,600
 "and went into the pigs.

422
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,500
 "The herd, about 2,000 in number,

423
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,100
 "rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned."

424
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,660
 I always saw this as the pigs

425
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,180
 jumping off a cliff into the lake.

426
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,820
 I was just there right where this happened.

427
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,180
 And it's actually a hillside,

428
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
 and the lake is about 100 yards away.

429
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,180
 So it means the pigs ran down the hillside,

430
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,700
 ran down the steep bank, and rushed, it says,

431
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,960
 into the water, which is even crazier

432
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,620
 than just jumping off a cliff to me.

433
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,580
 It kinda changed the way that I think about this.

434
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,220
 And so this man who was under the influence

435
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,100
 of 2,000 demons is no match for Jesus.

436
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,880
 Do you see this crazy scene?

437
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,620
 You have to see this.

438
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,280
 He's like, "Will you give us permission?"

439
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,060
 Could you imagine, like, so just if I'm talking,

440
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,780
 and I was like, "Yeah, my wife wanted to go to the store,

441
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,420
 "so I gave her permission."

442
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,140
 [congregation laughing]

443
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,060
 Like, you guys are gonna be like,

444
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,560
 "We're out on that, dude."

445
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,360
 Like, that's rude and disrespectful,

446
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
 and that's all, like, submissive.

447
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
 "You gave her permission."

448
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,580
 Like, this, Jesus is like,

449
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,640
 "Yeah, I guess I give you permission."

450
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,240
 Do you see the sovereignty over this?

451
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,360
 Do you see what's occurring?

452
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,600
 Do you see how strong and how powerful he is

453
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
 that this guy that no one could hold down,

454
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,840
 in act one, it says everyone was afraid of him.

455
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,000
 In act two, it said he was afraid of Jesus.

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,040
 Like, acting completely out of fear.

457
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,040
 "Please don't harm me, Jesus."

458
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,180
 2,000 demons versing Jesus.

459
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,840
 "Please don't hurt us, Jesus."

460
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,480
 Doesn't that change everything?

461
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,560
 My second point is the enemy is no match for Jesus.

462
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,400
 You gotta believe this.

463
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,360
 The enemy is no match for Jesus.

464
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,320
 See, Jesus versus Satan is not like me versus Brandon Slay.

465
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,740
 It's like Brandon Slay versus a kitten, okay?

466
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,240
 That's what this is like.

467
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,920
 It's like, he's like, "There's no problem here.

468
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,840
 "There's no challenge here."

469
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,640
 Jesus doesn't lift a fist.

470
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
 He doesn't clench a fist.

471
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,680
 He says a few words and the scene is done, problem solved.

472
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,200
 Effortless.

473
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:35,380
 What this is about, I don't know if you have 2,000 demons.

474
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,000
 (congregation laughing)

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,440
 But what I think this is about is Jesus heals someone

476
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,360
 so much worse off than you.

477
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,720
 And so here's the most prideful thing

478
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,040
 someone's ever said to me up here.

479
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,880
 You ready?

480
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,200
 The most prideful thing I've ever heard anybody say.

481
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,360
 "Jesus can't help me."

482
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,200
 What?

483
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,720
 No, man, you don't, I've been addicted to porn

484
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,800
 since I was in the fifth grade.

485
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,820
 There's no cure.

486
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,880
 Have you read?

487
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,920
 Jesus can't help me.

488
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 You are a prideful, arrogant, lost in your sin,

489
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 completely consumed by the evil that you fed

490
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,040
 if you think that your God is so tiny.

491
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,080
 And my God ain't.

492
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,700
 My God's so huge.

493
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,920
 JP, you don't understand the abuse that I've encountered.

494
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,800
 You're right.

495
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,500
 Let me tell you a couple things.

496
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,440
 One, I've heard it all.

497
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,000
 I think you're gonna be hard-pressed to surprise me.

498
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,880
 And there is some crazy, wicked evil in the world.

499
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,680
 My God is so much bigger.

500
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,480
 He will restore you, he will heal you,

501
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
 he will use you, he will set you free.

502
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,600
 And he will change the world through you if you let him.

503
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
 And if you think I'm just talking, I've seen him do it.

504
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
 I see him do it all the time.

505
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 I mean, molestation, rape, terrible, unspeakable,

506
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,840
 sex slavery, heroin, addiction, methamphetamine,

507
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,340
 addiction, and all of those things combined.

508
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,400
 I've seen him set 'em free and use 'em,

509
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,440
 give 'em joy, restore their spirit.

510
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
 2000 demons right here.

511
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,760
 So this is a miracle, clearly a miracle

512
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,720
 just like every single conversion is a miracle,

513
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,680
 is an amazing, supernatural act of God

514
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,440
 that you were headed for hell and he came into your life

515
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,320
 and changed your heart and gave you an appetite for him.

516
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,000
 C.S. Lewis said it like this about his own conversion.

517
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,120
 As he looked in the mirror, he wrote,

518
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,520
 "In surprised by joy, C.S. Lewis said,

519
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,480
 he wrote, "In surprised by joy, C.S. Lewis also wrote,

520
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
 "Narnia," what I referenced earlier,

521
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,420
 he said about himself, "For the first time,

522
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,500
 "I examined myself with a seriously practical purpose

523
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,520
 "and there I found what appalled me,

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,000
 "a zoo of lust, a bedlam of ambitions,

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 "a nursery of fears, a harem of fondled hatreds.

526
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,800
 "My name was Legion."

527
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,840
 I really relate to that.

528
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,520
 And so I don't have a lot of time here,

529
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,400
 but just quickly to try to answer some of your questions.

530
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,160
 Jesus casted out a demon, demons, 2,000 demons,

531
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,300
 sent them into pigs.

532
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,200
 Why into pigs?

533
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,040
 Why is that in here?

534
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,240
 Let me tell you why that's in here, because it happened.

535
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,840
 There is no reason in the world

536
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,560
 that anybody would be in a creative writing class

537
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,240
 like where do we wanna send the demons?

538
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,860
 Let's send them into the pigs.

539
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,000
 But no, Matthew, Mark, and Luke saw it happen

540
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,120
 and wrote it down and it's crazy, okay?

541
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 And it's written down because it happened and they saw it

542
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,040
 and they were like, "We gotta tell somebody about the pigs.

543
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
 "This is crazy."

544
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,040
 And so that's why it's in here.

545
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,160
 And so why don't we call out demons?

546
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,800
 Like you probably, if you've been here long,

547
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
 you've probably never seen me say,

548
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,440
 "In the name of Jesus Christ, I cast you out."

549
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,720
 And I've wrestled with that before.

550
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,560
 I'll tell you, my really quick answer to this

551
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 is because Jesus gives us a better way.

552
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,480
 See, I think, especially as young adults,

553
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
 like we wanna conjure up the power,

554
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,840
 we don't study church history,

555
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,760
 we come in, we think we found something great,

556
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,940
 we stepped into a church and we have embraced the theology

557
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,160
 and we love the supernatural and we're obsessed with it.

558
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,960
 And so we think that you can like pray

559
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,420
 or you can cast it out.

560
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,760
 You can pray, you know, boring spiritual discipline,

561
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,960
 or you can get loud and I was in Haiti once in Africa

562
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,600
 and you won't believe in it rolling down.

563
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,920
 I've been there, I've seen it, okay?

564
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
 Let me tell you what Jesus says, Matthew,

565
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,160
 I'm sorry, Mark chapter nine, verse 26.

566
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,400
 There's a man whose son is possessed by a demon

567
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
 and he's throwing him into fire,

568
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,860
 throwing him into water, trying to drown him.

569
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,100
 And the disciples go to him and say,

570
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,880
 "In the name of Jesus Christ, I call you out."

571
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,160
 And nothing happens.

572
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,760
 And so the man goes to Jesus and says,

573
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,240
 "They tried to cast out a demon, but nothing happened."

574
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,680
 And Jesus says this, it says,

575
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,240
 "The spirit shrieked and convulsed him."

576
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,600
 Jesus cast it out, "Convulsed him violently.

577
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
 "And he came out and the boy looked so much like a corpse

578
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,560
 "that many said he's dead.

579
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,480
 "But Jesus took him by the hand

580
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,840
 "and lifted him to his feet and stood up.

581
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,160
 "And after Jesus had gone indoors,

582
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,700
 "his disciples came to him and asked him privately,

583
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,920
 "'Why couldn't we drive it out?'

584
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,060
 "And he replied, "'Because this one

585
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,000
 "'only comes out by prayer.'"

586
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,460
 He says, "You got two options.

587
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,500
 "You and your power can call and say,

588
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,340
 "'In the name of Jesus, I,'

589
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,720
 "or you can go to God,

590
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,800
 "the one who 2,000 demons just fell down and worshiped

591
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
 "and say, 'Will you?'"

592
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,320
 And Jesus right here, and read it for your own eyes

593
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,120
 in case you are tempted not to believe me,

594
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,440
 says, "That's a better way.

595
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,260
 "That's a stronger, more powerful way.

596
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,960
 "And we hate that.

597
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,420
 "If you are like me in my flesh, you're like,

598
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,120
 "No, don't just give me the boring spiritual disciplines.

599
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,620
 "Give me something crazy.

600
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,040
 "'Cause I'm crazy."

601
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,620
 (congregation laughing)

602
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,720
 You can tell it to come out,

603
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,680
 or you can turn to the one who overpowered 2,000 demons

604
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,800
 and say, "Hey, will you do something over there?"

605
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,560
 And Jesus says, "Hey, do that."

606
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,120
 The really difficult kind,

607
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,380
 you need to call on something bigger than yourself.

608
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,800
 And so, whatever your addiction is,

609
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,420
 your body image, your pornography,

610
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,700
 whatever you're stuck in, whatever you can't get out of,

611
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,760
 you're fighting something stronger than you,

612
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,320
 but you're not fighting anything stronger than God.

613
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,760
 And you need to turn to God,

614
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,220
 devote yourselves to the teachings, to prayer,

615
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,840
 to the breaking of the bread, to the spiritual disciplines,

616
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,040
 to the studying his word,

617
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
 to writing his word on your heart,

618
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
 to holding fast to a better promise.

619
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,100
 And you say, "Is there just something quick, though?"

620
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,520
 No.

621
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,020
 I mean, God could do it quick, for sure.

622
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,160
 But more times than not, he says,

623
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,600
 "No, step into a process

624
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,100
 "where you actually get to know me,

625
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,420
 "and we can have a relationship,

626
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,960
 "and you're not just looking for an aspirin."

627
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,380
 (congregation laughing)

628
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,180
 You say, "Well, why, but Jesus cast it out."

629
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,140
 That's right, you're not Jesus.

630
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,140
 There is something unique happening

631
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,500
 with Jesus and his apostles here

632
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,380
 where the miracles are constantly authenticating the message.

633
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,060
 I mean, he's talking to evil forces.

634
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,780
 He's communicating with them, and they're talking back,

635
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,000
 and there's something unique happening here.

636
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
 And if you don't believe me,

637
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,680
 there's a place in the scripture where the disciples said,

638
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,600
 "Hey, there's this guy casting out a demon in your name,

639
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,280
 "but we asked him to stop."

640
00:27:52,280 --> 00:28:00,360
 And here in Acts 19, verse 13,

641
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,720
 some Jews went around driving out evil spirits,

642
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,680
 tried, some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits

643
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,000
 tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus

644
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,480
 over those who were demon-possessed.

645
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,280
 They would say, "In the name of the Jesus

646
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,780
 "whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out."

647
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,340
 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest,

648
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,100
 were doing this, and so this Jewish chief priest,

649
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,580
 Sceva, has seven sons.

650
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,140
 They're going out, they're casting out demons

651
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,060
 in the name of Jesus.

652
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,020
 And one day, the evil spirit answered them,

653
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,760
 "Jesus, I know, and Paul, I know about, but who are you?"

654
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,660
 The man who had the evil spirit jumped on them,

655
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,180
 overpowered them all.

656
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,360
 He gave them such a beating, gotta love that.

657
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,460
 He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house,

658
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,480
 naked and bleeding.

659
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,040
 Seven men run into a fight, seven men run out

660
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,580
 with no clothes on, and they're bleeding.

661
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,780
 They lost, that's what that means.

662
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,620
 Let me tell you what that means.

663
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,700
 In the Greek, that translates, they lost.

664
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,340
 They did not win the fight.

665
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,060
 And so I would not recommend you going around

666
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,580
 commanding demons to come out.

667
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,220
 I would recommend you pray, and you fast,

668
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,320
 and you share truth, because this is a truth encounter.

669
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,780
 This is a truth encounter.

670
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,940
 When the disciples came up to Jesus, and they say,

671
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,260
 "Hey, this man's casting out demons, your name."

672
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,140
 He said, and they said, "But we stop him."

673
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,780
 Jesus said, "You don't need to stop them."

674
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,420
 Not because, "Hey, I want them to do that,"

675
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,340
 or, "I hope that they do that."

676
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
 He never commands us to do that.

677
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,060
 He says, "But if he's doing that,

678
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,460
 "then he can't preach against me.

679
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,780
 "He can't come later and say, 'Crucify him.'"

680
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:35,220
 And so here's what this text is telling us,

681
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,740
 is that there is a condition that you cannot recover from

682
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,060
 apart from Jesus.

683
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
 There is a condition that exists in humans

684
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,580
 that cannot be recovered from apart from Jesus.

685
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,260
 You will never, ever be well apart from Jesus.

686
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,580
 When I first wrote that down, I was like,

687
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,300
 "Man, that's profound, and it's gonna go viral on Twitter

688
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,140
 "and be amazing."

689
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,980
 And then I thought about it again,

690
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,260
 and I was like, "Yeah, it's called sin."

691
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,540
 There's nothing profound about that,

692
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,940
 that the sin that we were born into,

693
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,260
 we cannot recover from apart from Jesus.

694
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,180
 This Sunday, I took my family to eat

695
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,420
 on Lower Greenville.

696
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,300
 Took the girls, Presley and Finley,

697
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,740
 and my wife and Weston, three kids and Monica,

698
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,180
 and we're walking into the restaurant,

699
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,380
 and there's this man sitting there in the back

700
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,900
 on the street near the restaurant, big dude, dreadlocks,

701
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,700
 tattoos on his face, and I just said,

702
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,540
 "Hey, what's up, man?"

703
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,860
 He says, "Hi," and we go in, we eat,

704
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,580
 and about an hour and a half later, we come out,

705
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,100
 and he's still sitting there.

706
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,740
 Tell him hi again.

707
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,940
 He says, "Hey, can you spare some change?"

708
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,540
 And I say, I go, and I'm thinking,

709
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,260
 I'm always trying to assess the need,

710
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,740
 and how do I meet the need, and what is the need?

711
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,420
 Is the need money, what is the need?

712
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,620
 So I begin to have a conversation with him,

713
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,020
 and if I'm honest with you, like in my flesh,

714
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,700
 I'm like, "This is gonna be an incredible,

715
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,540
 "teachable moment."

716
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,380
 I'm like, "Come around, kids.

717
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,500
 "Daddy's about to share the gospel.

718
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
 "Get a pen."

719
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,740
 (congregation laughing)

720
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
 And I'm like, "What's your name?"

721
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,820
 And he's like, "My name is Legion."

722
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,660
 No, he didn't say that.

723
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,540
 He said, (congregation laughing)

724
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,940
 he said, "My name is Carl."

725
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,100
 And I said, "Hi, Carl."

726
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,460
 And we're having this great conversation, Carl and I,

727
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,220
 and Carl has a cross tattoo right here on his forehead,

728
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,180
 and I say, you know, we're talking, everything's fine,

729
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,020
 everything's lucid.

730
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,540
 I say, "Carl, tell me about that tattoo."

731
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,900
 And he goes, "Well, you know how many rings

732
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,660
 "are around Saturn?"

733
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,300
 And I was like, "Man, science class seven, maybe?

734
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,140
 "I'm not sure."

735
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,740
 And he says, "Well, if you take the first ring

736
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,180
 "and you make it a screwdriver

737
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,260
 "and you stick it right here inside my head

738
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,660
 "and I pull it out, what am I gonna do with it?"

739
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,740
 (congregation laughing)

740
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,180
 I'm like, "Is this a test?"

741
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,220
 (congregation laughing)

742
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,020
 No, I'm like, "Hey, kids, go back to the car."

743
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,700
 (congregation laughing)

744
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,020
 Like, where is the screwdriver, Carl?

745
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,020
 And, and, and we're laughing, and it's fun here,

746
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,660
 but it's really heartbreaking, honestly.

747
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:12,540
 And I talked to Carl a minute longer

748
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,540
 and invited him here, and the conversation, you know,

749
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,540
 got kinda weird, as if it could get weirder,

750
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,220
 and we got in the truck, and my little girl, Presley,

751
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,100
 you know, just the innocence of a child,

752
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,300
 says, "Daddy, you should've given him money

753
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,820
 "to go to the spa."

754
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,300
 (congregation laughing)

755
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,980
 And I said, in response, I don't say that

756
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,380
 to doggone him at all, it's just what happened.

757
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,380
 And I said, "Presley, Carl needs something

758
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:47,500
 "so much more than what Daddy can do right now.

759
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,560
 "Carl doesn't need to be cleaned on the outside,

760
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,940
 "Carl needs to be cleaned on the inside.

761
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
 "Carl needs to be washed on the inside.

762
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,700
 "Carl's been given over to his sin.

763
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,520
 "He's indulged in something for so long,

764
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,720
 "that it's completely consumed him and overpowered him.

765
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,400
 "And so we just need to pray for Carl."

766
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,460
 And it's interesting that I wrote down in this outline,

767
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,160
 before that happened, and in my mind,

768
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,120
 I didn't connect the dots, I said, "This man exists.

769
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,760
 "You know, he's in Dallas, he lives somewhere."

770
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,800
 And I never even connected, then God placed him

771
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,840
 right in front of me.

772
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:27,500
 He needs something more powerful than me.

773
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,920
 He needs the one that was so powerful

774
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,640
 that he changed me on those same streets.

775
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,960
 I was on Lower Greenville when someone

776
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,000
 invited me to this place.

777
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,760
 I was in the bar right there beside where we ate.

778
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,120
 When someone said, "Hey, will you come to church

779
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,960
 "with me tomorrow?"

780
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,240
 I sat right back there.

781
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,440
 We met in high school at the time, hungover.

782
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,420
 And the Spirit of God began to make me new, verse 14.

783
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,420
 Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this

784
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,240
 in the town and countryside.

785
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,720
 And the people went out to see what happened

786
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,200
 when they came to Jesus, they saw the man

787
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,880
 who had been possessed by the legion of demons

788
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,920
 sitting there dressed in his right mind,

789
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,160
 and they were afraid.

790
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,080
 And I see this all the time.

791
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,440
 Like, just the other day, like a couple weeks ago,

792
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,600
 I'm talking to this guy, and he's like in a polo,

793
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,280
 tucked in, khaki shorts, like clean-cut dude,

794
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,920
 and we're talking, and he's like, "Yeah, I was a drug dealer

795
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
 "on the streets, and this, and that, and whatever."

796
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,400
 And I'm like, "Bro, what happened to you?"

797
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,040
 He's like, "Jesus changed my life."

798
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
 Yes, he did.

799
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,040
 Yes, he did.

800
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,520
 Those who had seen it told the people

801
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,400
 what had happened to the demon-possessed man

802
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,880
 and told about the pigs as well.

803
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,000
 Then the people began to plead with Jesus

804
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,840
 to leave their region.

805
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,040
 Why?

806
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,680
 Why did they say, "Jesus, you gotta leave"?

807
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,500
 Why?

808
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,040
 Because he cost them something.

809
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,080
 A couple hundred thousand dollars in pigs and swine.

810
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,360
 They're like, "You gotta get out of here."

811
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,520
 They didn't care about the man,

812
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
 they didn't care about his health.

813
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,240
 What about our pigs, man?

814
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 Get out!

815
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,000
 (pages flipping)

816
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,360
 Verse 18, "As Jesus was getting into the boat,

817
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,620
 "the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.

818
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,060
 "Jesus did not let him, but said,

819
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
 "Go home to your own people,

820
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,080
 "and tell them how much the Lord has done for you,

821
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,960
 "and how much he has had mercy on you.

822
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,760
 "So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis

823
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,580
 "how much Jesus had done for him,

824
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,720
 "and all the people were amazed."

825
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,920
 If you were here last week, you saw the rich, young ruler

826
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,120
 say, "Hey, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

827
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,040
 Jesus says, "Come with me," and he leaves sad.

828
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,480
 "I can't sell everything and come with you."

829
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,920
 This man says, "Jesus, I wanna go with you, please."

830
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,260
 Jesus says, "No, you stay here.

831
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,760
 "You reach these people."

832
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,400
 And there he is, it's like,

833
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,520
 "Bro, is that you?

834
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,580
 "We went to high school together.

835
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,060
 "You're the demon-possessed man, right?

836
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,280
 "You're the crazy one, you've been living in the tomb.

837
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,960
 "Why are you so normal?"

838
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,800
 Jesus.

839
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,920
 Jesus, that's amazing.

840
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,160
 That's amazing, you've changed so much.

841
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,420
 Jesus, this man, Jesus came in and he changed me.

842
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,380
 So my third and final point is the objective of Jesus.

843
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,120
 The objective of Jesus.

844
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,600
 Jesus' objective is to save people, to set them free.

845
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,200
 That's what he does, that's what he's really good at.

846
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,040
 He's a savior, he saves people.

847
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,640
 He sees people in need, he runs to them.

848
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,120
 He's here, he's hanging out with his boys in Capernaum,

849
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,540
 and he's like, "Hey, we gotta go.

850
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,220
 "Since he's the Lord God Almighty,

851
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,800
 "there's a dude who needs me, we gotta go."

852
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,360
 You're here, he knows about you.

853
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,560
 He knows about right where you're at, he knows everything.

854
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,360
 He knows about the images on the computer,

855
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,920
 the date that went too far, he knows about everything.

856
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,120
 The thoughts, the deeds, the work, the acts, the addictions.

857
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,840
 He knows about it all.

858
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
 And he's coming for you.

859
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,240
 You're like, "No, he's not coming for me."

860
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,920
 Where are you right now?

861
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,240
 Look around you.

862
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,480
 He's coming for you, he's winning.

863
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,360
 You have no hope against him.

864
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,520
 Check this out.

865
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,520
 When Jesus wants to save people, he saves a person.

866
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,320
 How true is that?

867
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,600
 When Jesus wants to save people, he saves a person.

868
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,160
 You think about the apostles.

869
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,980
 He wants to do work.

870
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,200
 Hey, come here, you guys, come here, 11 guys, right?

871
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,560
 Come here, I'm gonna change your life, set you free.

872
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,560
 The apostle Paul, who was an outspoken person

873
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,320
 against Christianity, Jesus comes in his life,

874
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,520
 changes him, and he does ministry to the very people

875
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,920
 that he was speaking against Christianity with.

876
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,260
 You think about, I mean, I go on, St. Patrick, a drunk,

877
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,600
 goes back to a bunch of drunks and tells them

878
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,200
 about the man who changed his life, St. Augustine.

879
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
 I could go on and on and on.

880
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,680
 When often Jesus wants to save people with struggles,

881
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,960
 he saves someone with that struggle.

882
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
 I see it all the time.

883
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,360
 He takes a mess and he gives them a message.

884
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,080
 He takes a mess and he makes a message

885
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,080
 that furthers his message, which is the gospel message.

886
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,920
 You come up to me afterwards and you get the courage

887
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,840
 to say, hey, I gotta tell you something.

888
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,960
 There's this thing that I've never told anyone.

889
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
 It's killing me.

890
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,040
 I thought I'd never deal with it,

891
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,160
 but once upon a time, I had an abortion.

892
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,480
 I'm gonna say, stop, time out.

893
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,200
 First of all, God loves you.

894
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,160
 Second of all, let me introduce you to my friend.

895
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,040
 She's been there.

896
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 She's done the same thing, and now God has created

897
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,660
 this incredible ministry around her.

898
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,920
 He's taken that mess and made it a message.

899
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,240
 He's redeeming it.

900
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,580
 He's gonna do that to you.

901
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,420
 Right?

902
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,220
 I mean, I talk about my pornography addiction

903
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,980
 that God has set me free from all the time,

904
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,060
 sexual addiction, alcoholism, drug use.

905
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,820
 And so what happens, the number one thing

906
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,500
 that I'm told after these messages is somebody comes up,

907
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,620
 the number one thing I hear over and over and over,

908
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,500
 dude, my story's just like yours.

909
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,540
 I know.

910
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,300
 That's why God would have me talk to you,

911
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,100
 and that's why he's gonna have you talk to them.

912
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,500
 That's what he does.

913
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,340
 That's the way this thing works, right?

914
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,220
 I mean, this is the way the gospel spreads.

915
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
 He takes a mess, he gives them a message.

916
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,060
 Jesus wants to save people.

917
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,020
 He saves a person.

918
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,900
 He wants to save people at your work, so he saves you.

919
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,540
 He wants to save people in your community,

920
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,520
 so he put you there.

921
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,980
 He saved you and put you there.

922
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,900
 That's what he does.

923
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,540
 This is the way this thing advances.

924
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,720
 This is the way the gospel moves forward.

925
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,540
 And so the application this evening

926
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,500
 is who did Jesus save you for?

927
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,380
 Who are your people?

928
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,660
 Who did he save you for?

929
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,140
 Because do you know that once the cap

930
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,540
 came off Jesus's ministry,

931
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,580
 once he's headed to the cross, listen to this,

932
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,460
 he never saved a single person just to save that person.

933
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,420
 Did you hear me?

934
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,420
 Jesus never saved a single person just to save that person.

935
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,100
 You think about just even the thief on the cross.

936
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,980
 Remember the thief on the cross?

937
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,620
 Jesus is there in the middle, guy here, guy here.

938
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,080
 This dude trusts Christ and shares the gospel

939
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,780
 with the only person he can.

940
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,860
 How crazy is that?

941
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,320
 I mean, he's got one person, he's about to die.

942
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,540
 Jesus says, "You're gonna be with me

943
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,620
 "and my father and my kingdom."

944
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,780
 Hey, man, do you not see who he is?

945
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,740
 Jesus has never saved a person just to save that person.

946
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,100
 He's always saved a person to save people.

947
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,680
 Give your life to that, family.

948
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,280
 Give your life to that, friend.

949
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,480
 That's why we're here.

950
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,320
 Let's see this movement take over the world.

951
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,880
 Let's see it consume the world.

952
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,080
 I don't know if you look around you, man,

953
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,320
 we're in a world of hurt.

954
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,520
 What are you doing?

955
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
 What are you doing?

956
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,220
 Don't just sit on this thing, man.

957
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,660
 Don't keep it to yourself.

958
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,360
 Sometimes people reject it

959
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,120
 based on what it's gonna cost them.

960
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,600
 2,000 pigs, but in Acts 19,

961
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,960
 you compare that to Acts 19 in the church of Ephesus,

962
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,120
 the same Acts 19 that I read earlier,

963
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,400
 seven sons of Sceva.

964
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,360
 It says that witches and sorcerers were coming

965
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,320
 with $5 million in scrolls burning them

966
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,320
 because they found something greater in Christ.

967
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
 There's some people that are like,

968
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,640
 "Nah, it's gonna cost me too much."

969
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,560
 Dude, I see you.

970
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
 You don't have sex anymore, bro.

971
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,820
 I'm out on that.

972
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,840
 No, man, you're not fun anymore.

973
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,480
 You don't go to the bar or the club with us anymore.

974
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,060
 Dude, I'm not into that.

975
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,960
 No, you're too prude these days, bro.

976
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,520
 You're not any fun anymore.

977
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,440
 But there's some people that,

978
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,800
 man, there's something different about you

979
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,920
 I gotta have for myself, man.

980
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,760
 What is that?

981
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,920
 I gotta give me some of that.

982
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,160
 It's like some people are gonna,

983
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,200
 what about the pigs, bro?

984
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,660
 We're out, get outta here.

985
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,880
 And some people are just gonna be amazed.

986
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,720
 I hear it all the time.

987
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,320
 I'm up here, I'm like, I always ask people,

988
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
 "How'd you get to the poor?"

989
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,840
 Dude, I went to school with this girl.

990
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,880
 She was a total B, and then I ran into her.

991
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,080
 That's your words, not mine, okay?

992
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,920
 Don't judge me.

993
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,000
 [congregation laughing]

994
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 I'm always like, "Wow, that's courageous."

995
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,160
 [congregation laughing]

996
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
 And then I ran into her, and she was different.

997
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,080
 She was so different.

998
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,100
 She was kind and compassionate and joyful,

999
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,360
 and she invited me here, and so I came.

1000
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,440
 Guys are like, "Man."

1001
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,280
 I'm like, "How'd you get here?"

1002
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
 They're like, "Dude, I went to school with this guy.

1003
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,360
 "He was a bully, and they usually use some choice words."

1004
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,000
 And then I saw him, and he was in his right mind

1005
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,080
 and clothed, and--

1006
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
 [congregation laughing]

1007
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,400
 And he's like, "Come to the porch with me."

1008
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,360
 I'm like, "Okay, I'm amazed, okay."

1009
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
 That's what happens.

1010
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,680
 That's what happened.

1011
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,560
 I mean, sometimes he comes for the worst.

1012
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,600
 You're here, and you're like, "No, I'm too far gone."

1013
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,760
 What an arrogant, prideful statement.

1014
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,560
 This guy, he didn't have an exorcism ministry.

1015
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,800
 He just went and told people what had happened to him,

1016
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,640
 that he was made new.

1017
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,560
 He didn't go forward and be like,

1018
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,880
 "Okay, I'm casting out demons now."

1019
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,840
 He just said, "No, man, Jesus changed me.

1020
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,000
 "And Jesus saved him to get them."

1021
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,760
 How powerful is this?

1022
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,040
 You're gonna be in heaven with this guy.

1023
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,600
 If you're here and you're a follower of Christ,

1024
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,520
 you'll probably meet this guy.

1025
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,600
 And not just this guy, but a bunch of people from this city.

1026
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,440
 You're gonna be up there, and like, "Hey, how are you?

1027
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,280
 "How'd you get here?"

1028
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,160
 And they'll be like, "Oh, man, the crazy demon man

1029
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
 "came up to us and told us about Jesus, and here we are.

1030
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,440
 "We've been here for 2,000 years waiting on you.

1031
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
 "It's amazing."

1032
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,640
 I talked to Brandon Slay yesterday, the wrestler,

1033
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,400
 and just said, "Hey, can I tell the story?"

1034
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
 And here's the crazy thing about that,

1035
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,360
 as I think about it.

1036
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,600
 So we worked here together.

1037
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,960
 He was like, "I wanna give my life to vocational ministry."

1038
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,360
 And as we worked here together, he thought,

1039
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,280
 "You know what, I'd be more effective

1040
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,000
 "doing what God made me to do."

1041
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,280
 And so he moved to Colorado.

1042
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,000
 He works at the Olympic Training Center,

1043
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,360
 training Olympians and discipling them.

1044
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,440
 I mean, some of you, I've met people here

1045
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,040
 who have been discipled by him that now serve with us here,

1046
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,160
 because he's like, "Those are my people.

1047
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,100
 "I've gotta go back to my people.

1048
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,880
 "I was a crazy, lost guy.

1049
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,640
 "God took this athlete, he did something amazing.

1050
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,480
 "He made me one in a billion good.

1051
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,120
 "And so now I've gotta go back to people

1052
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,460
 "who are one in a billion good

1053
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,240
 "and tell them about this great God."

1054
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,720
 And when I talked to him yesterday, he said,

1055
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,900
 "Man, that's absolutely true.

1056
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,480
 "And now I'm going to the University of Pennsylvania

1057
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,480
 "where I wrestled to coach and to tell people about Jesus.

1058
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
 "I've gotta use the gifts and the talents

1059
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
 "that the Lord entrusted to me

1060
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 "to make this God more famous."

1061
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,560
 Who are your people, friends?

1062
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,160
 Who does God wanna save through you?

1063
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,820
 Who did God change you for?

1064
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,820
 And so, in summary,

1065
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,960
 Satan may offer you power in order to make you a slave.

1066
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,140
 That's his objective, to make you a slave.

1067
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,200
 When Jesus wants to save people, he sets someone free.

1068
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,940
 And the objective of Jesus is to set you free.

1069
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,940
 I don't know how well you know the gospel,

1070
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,660
 just the good news.

1071
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,680
 It's the great exchange.

1072
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,500
 The easiest way I know how to explain the gospel to people

1073
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,960
 is just to say that Jesus got what you deserve,

1074
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,860
 which is he was tortured, an eternal God in a moment.

1075
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,120
 In eternity of torture, that's what you deserve.

1076
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,420
 That's what your sin deserves.

1077
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,420
 Jesus, an eternal God, is the only one on the planet,

1078
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,020
 the only one ever created who could endure that,

1079
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,620
 not created, begotten,

1080
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,940
 who could endure that.

1081
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,600
 And he endured that on your behalf.

1082
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,080
 And so, if you trust in that, you get what he deserves.

1083
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,420
 That's the great exchange.

1084
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,780
 It's a very simple way to share the gospel.

1085
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,380
 Christ got what you deserve.

1086
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,320
 You get what he deserves.

1087
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,180
 He traded places with you.

1088
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,800
 He traded places with you.

1089
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,620
 You see what happened here?

1090
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,340
 You see what happened in this story?

1091
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,220
 Jesus traded places with this guy.

1092
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,760
 He went to him.

1093
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,800
 Like, think about Jesus in Capernaum,

1094
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,780
 and he's just like, man, I gotta go get this guy.

1095
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,640
 Man, I gotta go to Frisco.

1096
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,240
 I gotta go to Uptown.

1097
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,220
 Gotta go to Midtown.

1098
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,240
 Gotta go to Lower Greenville.

1099
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,520
 Gotta go to West Seventh.

1100
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,880
 Gotta go to Como.

1101
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:29,600
 Gotta go to Plano, to Addison.

1102
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,740
 I've gotta go see about someone.

1103
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:38,800
 Goes, and he pursues, and he overcomes evil.

1104
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,360
 And let me show you something amazing.

1105
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,240
 He trades places with him.

1106
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,680
 'Cause there, Jesus was abandoned,

1107
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,680
 naked, bound, bleeding, in pain,

1108
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,480
 crying out, living among the tombs.

1109
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,320
 Do you see that?

1110
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,600
 He traded places with him.

1111
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,200
 There he was, bound, naked, bleeding, tortured,

1112
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,380
 in the tombs with the dead.

1113
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,440
 There he was, traded places with this guy.

1114
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,760
 He did this for you.

1115
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,440
 He endured the punishment that you deserve

1116
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,960
 to give you the life that he deserves.

1117
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,720
 An eternal God, a perfect being,

1118
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,760
 someone who has never sinned, never done wrong.

1119
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,000
 And he says, you can have everything

1120
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,520
 that my father wants to give me

1121
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,800
 because you trusted that I took on everything

1122
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,400
 that is coming to you.

1123
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,320
 And you, don't you dare think for one second

1124
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,080
 that you're beyond his reach, or that your sin is too big.

1125
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,100
 That is the most prideful statement you can make.

1126
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,240
 It's the most prideful thought that you could have,

1127
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,560
 is that a God who can, with his voice,

1128
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,840
 take care of 2,000 demons,

1129
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,880
 can't save you right now.

1130
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,920
 I mean, you go home tonight, you take your computer

1131
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,800
 and you throw it out the window.

1132
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,960
 Take your phone and throw it in the garbage.

1133
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,680
 You take that dude's number and you delete it

1134
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,700
 and you block it.

1135
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,760
 Okay, you go in the liquor cabinet

1136
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,640
 and you throw them all away.

1137
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,800
 You go to the magazines that you obsess over

1138
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,560
 and find identity in, and why can't I look like her?

1139
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,440
 And you cut them up and you put them in the garbage

1140
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,640
 and you say, I'm a new creation.

1141
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,440
 I trusted in Jesus Christ that he died for my sins.

1142
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,120
 And that God, who's all powerful, raised him from the dead.

1143
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,720
 What can overcome him?

1144
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:43,200
 What can overcome him, huh?

1145
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,360
 Nothing.

1146
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,840
 Not a thing.

1147
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,520
 And if you're the worst person in the room, awesome.

1148
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,440
 That's who he's after.

1149
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,000
 And if you're the best person in the room,

1150
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,140
 you're self-righteous.

1151
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,160
 And he's after you too.

1152
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,480
 Let me pray.

1153
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,760
 God, we need you.

1154
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,360
 Can't do this without you.

1155
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,800
 We can't save ourselves.

1156
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,080
 We're cutting ourselves.

1157
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,320
 Focused on what we're not, what we don't have.

1158
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,240
 Can't do it alone.

1159
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,040
 Jesus, we need you.

1160
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,080
 Would you come into our lives?

1161
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,160
 Would you make us new?

1162
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,920
 We confess we're sinners.

1163
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,320
 We ran from you.

1164
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,200
 We've obsessed with all the wrong things.

1165
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,840
 We've given ourselves to sin.

1166
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,000
 We've worshiped other things than you.

1167
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,160
 Jesus, we're sorry.

1168
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,000
 We repent.

1169
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,480
 We turn from that.

1170
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,520
 Would you make our lives new?

1171
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,040
 Would you restore in us a conviction of your Holy Spirit?

1172
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,880
 Would you guide us and would you lead us?

1173
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,160
 In the name of your great and holy precious son,

1174
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,240
 Jesus Christ, amen.

1175
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,240
 Let me answer the question.

1176
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,080
 Nothing.

1177
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,560
 Nothing.

1178
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,520
 No height, nor depth, nor angels, nor demons,

1179
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,400
 any principalities, any rulers, any authorities,

1180
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,880
 nothing in all creation.

1181
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,160
 Kiss that hand and kiss that God.

1182
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,000
 Done, period.

1183
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,500
 (congregation applauding)

1184
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,920
 And so if you're trying to fight something stronger than you

1185
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,800
 call on the one stronger than it, okay?

1186
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,520
 Period.

1187
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,520
 Don't try to walk into that ring unarmed without Jesus.

1188
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,240
 Okay, it will not work.

1189
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 That will not go well for you.

1190
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:18,240
