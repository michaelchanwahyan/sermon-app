[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   And I thought about you guys tonight,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   and the verse where we're headed,
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.300]   and just all of those songs that we just sang,
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.220]   the way that we worship.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.800]   See, you're here tonight, and I want you to know
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.140]   with the rest of your life, you're gonna build some things.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.100]   You really are, you're gonna build some things.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.760]   You're gonna build a career, okay?
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300]   You may build a house one day.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.420]   You're gonna build relationships, alright?
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.180]   You're gonna build an image of yourself,
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.800]   like when you think of you, you identify yourself
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.500]   with some things, maybe I'm the cool guy, the surfer guy,
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.540]   maybe I'm the trendy girl, or maybe I'm the smart girl,
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420]   or the engineer, or whatever it is
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.620]   that you kind of identify yourself with.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920]   Maybe I'm the skater, right?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.020]   And the reality of it is, is what the Lord
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.180]   didn't build in and through you, it's not gonna last.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.340]   When Christmas comes, it's thrown out.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.760]   You get that?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.660]   Like when Jesus comes back,
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.580]   those things that God didn't do in and through you,
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.780]   the things that you held onto,
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.340]   the things that you didn't let go of,
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.800]   the things that you tried to control,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.460]   the things that were a lot of you and not a lot of him,
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.740]   that's not going to last.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.980]   It's vanity, it's meaningless, the scriptures say.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.020]   And so I fear for us that we're gonna get up there
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.900]   and this conversation is gonna look like this.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.380]   We're gonna stand there with God
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.780]   and we're gonna be in heaven, praise God,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.180]   and by his grace, and we're standing there with him,
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.900]   and I don't know if this will happen this way,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.860]   but we'll be like, hey God, remember when we,
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.260]   and he's like, no, that wasn't we, that was you.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.700]   No, remember when we did that thing and it was good thing,
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.780]   remember when we served the poor,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.380]   remember when I went to that job,
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.820]   remember when we did that,
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.660]   he's like, no, that wasn't, that wasn't,
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.220]   I was actually telling you to do something else,
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.260]   you weren't listening.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.260]   No, I was actually calling you to some other thing,
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.860]   but you weren't tracking with me.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.220]   No, I think you had good intentions,
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.860]   yeah, you got all fired up, you read a verse,
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.500]   you heard a sermon, but you weren't listening to me.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.820]   That was about you, let's be honest,
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100]   that was about you, here you are, you're here,
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.020]   well done, good and faithful servant,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.380]   but that wasn't, that wasn't me, that was you.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.780]   And so tonight I just thought about this one verse,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.220]   it's not even a whole verse, it's really just a half a verse,
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.660]   it's Psalm 127, one, and when I got with our team,
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.380]   our young adult team, and we thought about the vision
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.460]   of the poor and what God would have for us,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.340]   we thought about this verse, which is,
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.820]   it's a real simple idea, it says,
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.300]   unless the Lord builds the house,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.340]   its builders labor in vain.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.580]   And so I wanted to spend a short time with you,
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.820]   and then we're gonna be back to worship,
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.740]   I wanna spend a short time with you tonight
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.020]   just telling you about what is to come in 2013,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.140]   because the way that we take that month off,
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.100]   and I know some people, that frustrates some people,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.180]   but what we're doing there is we're dreaming
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.020]   and fasting and praying and asking God
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.420]   what he desires for us for the next year
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.300]   as we look at this city, so I'm just gonna give you
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.140]   three things, because the way my mind works,
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.700]   I kinda remember things in threes,
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.100]   and so it's three things that we have heard,
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.580]   our team has heard from the Lord,
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.740]   as we've asked him, hey, as you build this house,
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.500]   what do you want us to be about?
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.420]   And the first one is simply this, transformational truth.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.420]   You come to this place every Tuesday, seven o'clock,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.580]   and what you're going to hear, I hope,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.380]   is us teaching you the truth from the scriptures,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.700]   so that you don't just come and be entertained
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.620]   or hear a speaker or leave and get some tips
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.780]   and tricks for life, but that you would hear
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.620]   the word of God, that the spirit of God
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.740]   would make real to you, and that he would awaken your heart,
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.980]   and that as you leave this place,
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.300]   that you would live out those truths,
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.680]   and that this wouldn't be the only place
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.980]   of your Bible intake, but we wouldn't just teach you
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.360]   the Bible, but we would teach you how to learn
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.400]   from the scriptures, even on your own.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.460]   And so you will never come here and get some,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.340]   you know, feel good, just hey, here's how to do
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.900]   life message, you're gonna come here
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.820]   and get teaching from the scriptures
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.460]   that are relevant to 20 and 30 somethings
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.820]   as they move and live in Dallas, Texas.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.580]   And what's happened historically, as we've looked backwards,
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.620]   is as we have read from the scriptures,
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.760]   and the Holy Spirit has changed lives.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.660]   You have to understand that to be a follower
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.760]   of Jesus means to change.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.400]   So I don't care where you're at, right?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.120]   I don't care where you're at, I don't care
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640]   what you're struggling with, pornography,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.560]   or materialism, or you killed somebody in the parking lot,
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   or maybe you made up a fake girlfriend on Twitter,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   or you said you doped, or you didn't dope,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.880]   or whatever, and won seven tour de France,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.220]   I don't care what you did, okay?
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   I don't care who you are, right?
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.800]   I don't care, right?
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   The only thing that I care about is we don't stay there.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.000]   Is that the Spirit of God would continue to conform us
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   to the image and the character of Christ
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.240]   as we look at these scriptures,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.400]   and His Spirit informs your heart,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.120]   unless the Lord builds the house.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   It's builder's labor in vain.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   And so that's what we're about here,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.120]   transformational truth.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.340]   So just to give you a heads up of where we're headed,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.840]   we're gonna teach through two books this year,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.740]   both Galatians and the New Testament,
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.360]   one of Paul's letters to the Church of Galatia,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.400]   and Ecclesiastes of the Old Testament.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.060]   We're gonna go through some topical series
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.920]   on worry, anxiety, doubt, and depression.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.380]   Courage, we're gonna talk about courage,
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.960]   evangelism, living on mission.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   The spiritual disciplines,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   hey, how can I really learn to read my Bible?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.040]   How do I learn to apply this book to my life?
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.960]   What does it look like to have a healthy prayer life?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.800]   And those sorts of things.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.760]   And we're gonna kick off with a dating series
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.160]   called Cupid, Dating Myths.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.000]   Why?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.560]   Because I think that, frankly, one reason,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.540]   the vast majority of the people in the room are single.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.320]   Another reason is a lot of folks in the room
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.800]   wanna be married, but even if you don't,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.280]   we're gonna talk about how I think
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.160]   this is the single most effective way
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.600]   for you to disqualify your ministry.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.920]   We see a lot of people here are dating,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.640]   but not a lot of people here are dating
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.440]   in a way that honors God.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.080]   And so what does it mean to look towards
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.680]   the creator of the heavens and the earth
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.400]   and say, hey, how do I live my life
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.880]   most effectively for you?
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.720]   And so we're gonna start here,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.540]   and I know there's some girls here like,
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.380]   hey, man, I'd love to apply that to my life,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.640]   if only I'd get asked out, you know?
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.260]   And so I'm gonna tell the guys to ask you out.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.960]   Come, just come back for that, okay?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   So we're gonna talk through that.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.600]   And we're gonna talk about those problems
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   that we have in the ministry.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   Unless the Lord builds the house,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.120]   it's builder's labor in vain.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.800]   And so this is what this is about, this change.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.460]   Do you ever feel like you're looking at your life,
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.160]   and it's kind of like that gingerbread house,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.840]   when you start, when you're like thinking,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.320]   okay, I've gotta pray more, I resolve,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.000]   2013, I'm gonna pray more.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.680]   And you start praying more, and then all of a sudden,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.960]   the Bible study thing kind of falls off.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.840]   You're like, oh, no, I'm gonna study the Bible more.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.200]   You know, and then you start studying the Bible more,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.880]   and then all of a sudden, that sin struggle
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.560]   rears its ugly head.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.280]   You're like, okay, I'm gonna do away with that now.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.880]   2013 is my year, I'm gonna never look at that,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.760]   or go there, or be that again.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.840]   And then all of a sudden, this other thing,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.360]   you know, like your community group just becomes a problem.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.840]   Or something else kind of rears its head.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.600]   Or maybe you're going through life,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   and you're looking at your career,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   and your relationships, and your image,
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.160]   and all of these things that make you you,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.240]   and you kind of feel like a house of cards.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.320]   That any given moment, it's about to all come crashing down.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.720]   What does it really mean practically
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.520]   to stop and to say, hey, God, unless you build this house,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   I'm laboring in vain.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.760]   God, take your word and instruct my heart,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.240]   and help me to be a woman or a man of God,
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.440]   living a life that honors you,
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.240]   so that in that great and wonderful day,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.200]   you would say, well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.920]   The second thing we wanna be about
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.760]   is allowing you the opportunity
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   to connect to Christ followers.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.240]   So don't labor in vain, but also don't labor alone.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.480]   The Christian life, the life,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.640]   one life following Jesus was never meant to be done alone.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.120]   And so this is why people get in fraternities,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.840]   and sororities, and clubs, and even find niches at work.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.560]   We wanna help you find a group of folks
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   who are serious about following Jesus.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.600]   We wanna help you with that.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.400]   We wanna hand it to you as much as we can.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   And look around, it's a big place, I get it.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.840]   Okay, it can be intimidating.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.040]   It can't be intimidating, though.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.200]   The bigger we get, the smaller we must become.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.600]   I was at a coffee shop this weekend,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.040]   and a friend of mine, Greg, and I were there,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.680]   and Greg engaged with the barista and just said,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.080]   hey, you have a church home?
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.240]   And she said, yeah, I like to think I do.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.040]   And so we were talking, I just said,
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.680]   hey, you ever heard of Watermark?
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.880]   And she goes, yeah, the church?
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.600]   Yeah, and she goes, oh yeah,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.800]   I've been to the young adults thing there.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.400]   I was like, oh, that thing, man.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.440]   I was like, oh, that thing, it's a meat market.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.040]   And she goes, no, it wasn't that.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.840]   I was like, yes, praise God.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.000]   And she goes, but it was intense.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.400]   Oh yeah, that hair tick up front, it is intense.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.360]   No, I said, what do you mean by intense?
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.480]   She said, well, there was just a lot of people there.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.120]   See, I didn't know there were that many people ever
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.480]   at my age that gathered to talk about Jesus.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.200]   And it just hit me, I was like,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.240]   it's a problem if people come in,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.600]   and it feels big and it feels lonely.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.760]   And so we are really going to put forth effort this year
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.800]   to provide a place for you to connect deeply
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.160]   with those who follow Jesus, but I want you to know,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.840]   and this is really important that you know this, okay,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.760]   not everyone here is following Christ.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.920]   And so just because they've memorized some scripture
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.000]   and they're carrying around a Bible
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   and maybe they graduated from seminary,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.640]   it doesn't mean they know Jesus, okay?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.280]   So don't just say, okay, well, they're safe
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.520]   because I met 'em at the porch.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.440]   Be aware of that, okay?
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.680]   Kind of check a track record or inspect the reputation,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.120]   if you will, take some time.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.560]   And so that's just kind of a public servant announcement.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.320]   But I am, public service rather, announcement.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   I am passionate about you.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.920]   I am passionate about you finding those folks
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.520]   who are gonna be bridesmaids at your wedding,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   groomsmen at your wedding, folks whose children
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.480]   will play with your children growing up,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.440]   folks who you will bury, or at your funeral
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.000]   they will talk about your life.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.840]   But for now, I am passionate about you finding people
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.200]   that you can step into this amazing adventure
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.400]   that is following Jesus with,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.300]   so that you don't have to do it alone.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.340]   Because you'll feel alone in Dallas.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.100]   I'll tell you, there's a lot of people following Dallas,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.940]   not Jesus, right?
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.020]   There's a lot of people here tonight
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.620]   following Dallas, not Jesus.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.340]   And so we want to help you find some folks
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.620]   who follow Jesus so that you can connect deeply with them.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.260]   And so one way that we're going to do that
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.020]   is just January 27th, that's this Sunday, is a group link.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.740]   And so if this is your home church, come to group,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.860]   simple as this, I'm gonna make this real easy on you.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.860]   If this is your home church and you don't have
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.820]   a community group, come Sunday at 2 p.m.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.420]   and we're gonna help you find a community group.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.700]   Okay, if this is not your church home,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.640]   the vast majority, in fact, probably half of you or more,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.780]   this is not your church home, so be free.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.460]   Like, you're welcome here.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.860]   We want to be a young adult ministry that serves the city.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.080]   In fact, I spent a lot of my time over break
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.540]   meeting with other senior pastors
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.340]   and young adult pastors in this area
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.820]   and just talking about what could be if we yoked arms.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.220]   And I know a lot of them actually send their folks here.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.860]   And so we're glad you're here, welcome.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.580]   What we want to do with you is we want to help you,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.000]   help equip you to find that community at your home church
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.580]   so that you can come here together, be blessed together here
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.180]   but at the same time return there
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.940]   and continue to make a difference.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.320]   And so we exist to serve you as well.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.140]   But if you're here, if this is your church home,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.100]   then there's no excuse for you.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.340]   We're really going the extra mile to help you connect.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.980]   And there'll be the community rooms will continue
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.260]   after group link is over.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260]   And so I'm not talking about fake relationships,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.580]   I'm talking about real relationships.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.700]   If you want fake relationships,
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.080]   go to desperateforfriends.com or something.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.240]   But we're talking about real relationships of people
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.420]   who are following Jesus that you can lock arms with
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.820]   and change this city and change this world.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.620]   And so speaking of changes in this city and this world,
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.620]   the last thing that we want to be with about
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.020]   is sending and serving.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.140]   Sending you to serve others, okay.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.480]   We want to provide a place so that you can come
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.600]   but then we want to provide opportunities for you to go.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.100]   And so we want to be about serving this city
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.880]   that is called Dallas and changing the world.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.080]   We did a series last year just talking about
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.860]   changing the world and some people caught that vision.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.160]   And so every year we go to Haiti and we go to Africa
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.920]   but I want you to know we're gonna go
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.480]   wherever there is need, okay.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.660]   If a hurricane hits the coast, God forbid,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.680]   of New Orleans tonight, right,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.520]   then soon we will be there rebuilding that city.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.360]   Wherever there is need in this country,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.000]   wherever there is need in this world,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.320]   we will go there stewarding the gospel,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.760]   the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.600]   his death and resurrection which saves people,
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   not their lives, not gives them something to eat simply
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.800]   but allows them a place to live for eternity.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.300]   But we will also give them something to eat,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.800]   we will also give them water to drink,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.400]   we will also give them clothes to wear.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.160]   That's what we're about.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.240]   And so we're gonna do that, okay.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.520]   We're gonna do that this year.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.800]   We're gonna continue to do that.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.320]   God's going to continue to do that through us.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.880]   We can't do it alone, we don't wanna do it without him.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.960]   We're going to be about changing this world.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.680]   You guys remember me talking about,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.440]   if you were here, if you're a guest tonight,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.040]   you may not know this story but there was a guy,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.800]   his name was Simon, he lived in Sweden, okay.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.440]   He stole some software, some pirated software
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.200]   which had a watermark on it.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.640]   Simon had never in his life heard the gospel
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   and this is gonna rock your world
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.520]   'cause we live in Dallas now but Sweden
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.880]   is one of the most atheist countries in the world.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.040]   If not the most atheist country in the world.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.560]   Simon had no idea who Jesus was, okay.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.240]   He's 20 something years old and he's got this
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.400]   pirated software which he stole that has a watermark on it.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.440]   So he Googles how to get the watermark off this software.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.200]   He finds a series on YouTube called Boy Meets Girl.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.600]   It was the porch, he watched it.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.760]   He was intrigued because this tall, goofy guy
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.600]   was telling him that he shouldn't be having sex
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.520]   if he's single, all right.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.680]   And he's like, who in the world,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.160]   why would anybody listen to this idiot
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.120]   who's telling people that they shouldn't enjoy
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.200]   the pleasure of sex?
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.920]   This is crazy but he was intrigued
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.640]   and so he caught some other messages, right.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.280]   Then I'm sitting in my office,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.340]   one afternoon my phone rings and it's Simon from Sweden.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.320]   So I tell Simon about Jesus 'cause he said,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.640]   man, there's something different about those people.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.720]   I tell him about Jesus, he prays to receive Christ
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.200]   right there on the phone.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.160]   He gets plugged into a church there in Sweden
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.800]   and maybe you've heard that, yeah, it's worth it.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.560]   He gets plugged into a church there.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.480]   (congregation applauds)
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.080]   Check this out, he gets plugged into a church there
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.640]   and then he tells them about this place
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.160]   and so now their young adult ministry in Sweden
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.120]   podcasts the porch, that's what they do.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.000]   That's what they do when they gather.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.340]   But guess what, Simon's not there today.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.680]   This happened in 2012, guys.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.560]   Simon's not there today, why?
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.400]   He's a missionary in the Philippines.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.960]   You tracking with me?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.240]   The dude had never heard about Jesus
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.760]   and now he's like, wait a minute,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.160]   there's some people in the Philippines
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.080]   who don't know about Jesus.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.520]   I gotta go tell them about Jesus now.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   He is now a missionary, 365 days a year
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.160]   in the Philippines, this is God,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.500]   unless he builds the house.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.880]   Those who build it, labor in vain.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.600]   Okay, he's doing stuff.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.760]   And here's the deal, we wanna be missionaries in Dallas.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.600]   I've heard it said you either are a missionary
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.680]   or you need one, okay?
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   You either are a missionary or you need one.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.600]   And so I want you to be a missionary tonight
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   and tomorrow in the morning
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.120]   and when you show up to work, you're a missionary.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.560]   And there's some people that are getting this.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   We want to serve this city so that when the mayor has need,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.600]   he or she calls the porch, okay?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.460]   That we would be first responders in serving the city.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.240]   Jesus says in Matthew five that we're light of the world.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.220]   That's who we are and so let me just show you some pictures.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.600]   This is where we are, strategically placed in this city,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.560]   right, I think we have some images.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.880]   There we are, that's us, we're right there.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.220]   We are by one of the single most busiest intersections
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.240]   in the entire country of the United States of America,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.980]   strategically placed right here.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.680]   And if you zoom out now, this is our city.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   And that A right there, that's where we're at.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.600]   And so we want to impact those areas around us, okay?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.960]   Those are our areas of focus
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.220]   and so as you look at that map,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.380]   if your mission is Addison, there you go, you're right there.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.220]   If your mission is Uptown, you're there.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.420]   The M Streets, you're there.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.680]   University Park, you're there.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.060]   Maybe you live around White Rock
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.520]   and Lakewood or Lake Highlands.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.200]   There's your mission, okay?
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.780]   That's where you will be a missionary.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.440]   Maybe you work downtown, that's your mission.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.680]   Maybe you're here from Garland or Plano or Richardson.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.460]   Welcome, we're gonna send you.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.940]   If you don't go to Africa or Haiti with us
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.640]   or somewhere else, we're gonna resource you
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.780]   to impact your neighborhoods and your communities
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.200]   because man, if you're building something,
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.620]   if you're just building a beautiful U,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.160]   you're just building a big old house,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.960]   it's gonna crumble one day.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.160]   It's not gonna matter one day.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.980]   We always say this, I always ask it,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.500]   I think it's relevant, you know,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.100]   not many people here know their great-great-grandfather's
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.580]   name, he was alive 50 years ago.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.100]   That means 50 years from now, no one's driving
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.660]   down the street saying thank you,
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.400]   oh great-great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.020]   Insert your name.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.140]   You are but a memory and the only thing that will last
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.340]   is the impact that you made for the kingdom.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.380]   Did you guys know, did you know that 34 of your peers
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.980]   went out into the city and did a 48 hour
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.280]   mission trip this weekend?
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.140]   It was incredible.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.260]   34 of your peers went out and just shared
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.580]   the gospel in Dallas.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.460]   The way that this happened is we were in Haiti
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.320]   and we were sharing the gospel there in Haiti
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.580]   and you have to speak to an interpreter
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.820]   and it's a frustrating process 'cause you say something
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.660]   and the interpreter says something
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.500]   and the interpreter's a believer, a Christ follower,
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.540]   and so you just kinda get to this point
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.940]   where you're like hey, just tell them.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.060]   Just tell them about Jesus, like let's not do this,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.340]   I say it, you say it, just tell 'em, just tell 'em.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.820]   And then we said that at night,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.380]   we were kinda venting that frustration
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.580]   and we said well wait a minute, we don't do that.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.440]   I mean this guy's walking through his village.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.980]   When's the last time we walked through our village
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.140]   and said hey, can I tell you about Jesus?
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.420]   Hey, what about you, can I tell you about Jesus?
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.660]   What about you, can I tell you about Jesus?
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.140]   And so one of the guys there says hey, I'm gonna do it
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.420]   and I'm gonna take some people with me.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.820]   So he came back, Ryan Wall came back here
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.220]   and he put together a team and these folks,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.840]   our porch volunteers, they went into the city,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.700]   they stayed in uptown and they walked around uptown
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.140]   and downtown Dallas just sharing the gospel.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.760]   It was incredible, the first person they talked to
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.780]   in the parking lot trusted Christ.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.660]   And so these are some of the folks that they shared with.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.900]   They engaged with a Hindu, a Muslim, an atheist, a Jew,
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.940]   a Buddhist, de-churched, unchurched, dead-churched,
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.920]   watermark attenders, porch attenders, meth addicts,
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.180]   a girl considering an abortion and one of the girls
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.540]   that was there that was with us had had an abortion,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.860]   got to sit with her and so now she's reconsidering
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.940]   that decision, a guy who literally had just been released
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.780]   from prison that day.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.980]   One team didn't engage all weekend with a single person
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.220]   in Dallas, Texas who called themselves a Christian.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.760]   That's our city and that's why we wanna change it.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.640]   I'll read this, one girl just wrote this,
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.040]   one of our leaders wrote this when she got back.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.060]   "It came to reality Sunday evening
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.200]   "that these truly are the days.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.880]   "There is a specific reason I have the job,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.580]   "the community, the serving opportunities around me.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.120]   "I realized I'm in my prime and it's a short window
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.200]   "where I will have the energy and time to do it all
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.960]   "and right now I wanna do it all.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.120]   "I wanna go overseas as often as I can.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.540]   "I wanna study the scriptures as deeply as I can.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.520]   "I wanna learn and grow as much as I can
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.720]   "and I wanna pour out as much as I can.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.800]   "All weekend and throughout the young adult's world,
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.000]   "I see so many people distracted and individuals searching
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.120]   "for something to fill themselves.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.380]   "I see girls living for a man and doing everything they can
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.480]   "to fill that desire.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.520]   "I see people searching for the next thing to hold onto
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.740]   "or the next thing they think will make them happy,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.980]   "yet they are never satisfied and it's heartbreaking.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.540]   "I sat back this weekend and realized I want my life
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.140]   "to be different from the world
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.060]   "and I continually need to remind myself
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.980]   "that this earth is not my home.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.320]   "I don't want to get caught in the lies
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.040]   "and distractions all around me.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.420]   "For me personally, I'm seeing even more
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.080]   "that my singleness and the season of life I'm in
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.660]   "is truly a gift from God.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.200]   "It's an opportunity to go, serve, and learn.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.960]   "I would be wasting my days and time on earth
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.320]   "if I did not take advantage
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.980]   "of the opportunities around me.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.720]   "I'm still only a few hours removed from this weekend
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.780]   "and there are a number of things
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.080]   "the Lord needs to do in me, but all in all,
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.660]   "I want this year to be a time where I do it all,
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.960]   "not for me, but for Him.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.280]   "For unless the Lord builds the house,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.880]   "it's builder's labor in vain."
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.360]   And so he's building the house.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.300]   We need only to surrender and to look His way
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.500]   and to say, "God, what would you have me do?
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.700]   "What is faithfulness for me?
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.840]   "I don't want to manage my life.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.940]   "I don't want to balance my career and my relationship
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.000]   "and my image and my reputation.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.100]   "I give it all to you.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.000]   "Father, use it for your glory."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.300]   So here at the porch, we're gonna instruct you
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.180]   to hear through His word, the building up the temple,
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.300]   His temple in you.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.820]   We're gonna show you others in your life stage
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.540]   who you can connect with, who also desire Him.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.160]   And we're gonna give you opportunities to serve this city
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.200]   and change this world through your faithfulness.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.440]   That's Him working through your faithfulness.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.740]   Over the break, as we got together and prayed,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.760]   one thing that we did, we went to this house,
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.000]   and it was a new house, just a friend of ours had built.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.320]   It's really a beautiful home.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.520]   We all kind of had house envy at the end of the time.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.160]   I mean, just this incredible stone house
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.600]   with hand-scraped hardwoods and big cedar posts
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.880]   and just an incredible structure,
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.840]   really, really nice home.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.520]   And the reality of it is, is it's not gonna last.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.660]   Jesus said that, not one of these stones will stand upright.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.620]   And it took two years to build this home,
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.300]   and I just reflected with the team.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.860]   I was like, you know, one day, this home,
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.240]   it was just a slab.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   And nobody's really looking at the slab.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.640]   The guy shows up to the construction site,
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.320]   and all that's there is a big old sheet of concrete,
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.240]   and he's not standing there, you know, thinking,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.200]   oh, hey, look at this amazing, beautiful concrete.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.440]   I mean, there is somebody, right, who's doing that,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.200]   the person who built the slab, right?
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.360]   He's like, it's a beautiful slab.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.640]   But the reality of it is,
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.360]   is the structure hasn't been built yet.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.880]   And I think the temptation for us today
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.080]   is to look around and say, oh, look at what we got.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.280]   Look at what we've built.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.160]   Look at what I built with my hands.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.920]   Even look at this ministry.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.760]   That's my temptation.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.400]   Look at the ministry, right?
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.320]   Look how it's grown.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.960]   Look at the incredible things that we've done.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400]   No, man.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.720]   One, he's done it.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.920]   There's none of us that good.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.760]   It's him that's done it.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.280]   And I think, I think we're standing on the slab.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.800]   I think today, as you look around,
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   we're standing on the sheet of concrete.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.600]   And God's saying, hey, we just wait.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.800]   The best is yet to come.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.480]   I'm gonna build something beautiful through you,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.120]   and we're gonna change this city.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.640]   34 of your peers handed God their lives this weekend.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.080]   I wanna invite the band to come back up.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.120]   And we're gonna go back to worshiping him.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.920]   But I wanna say this.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.680]   34 of your peers, right,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.760]   they handed God their lives this weekend.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   Can you imagine if 3,400 of us did that?
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.720]   3,400 of us marching through uptown,
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.880]   arms locked, saying, hey, let's change this place
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.920]   for the cause of Christ.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.360]   Because one day, very, very soon,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.840]   we're gonna be dead.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.360]   In our car, in our house,
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.680]   in those shallow relationships,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.520]   in our career, in our image, in our reputation.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.360]   It's vanity.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.960]   One day, very soon, it's not gonna matter.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.720]   All that's gonna matter is how we built his kingdom,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.480]   how we shared his truth.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.640]   (silence)
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.800]   (silence)
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
