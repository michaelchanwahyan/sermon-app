 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,140
 Well, good evening, everybody.

3
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,020
 So glad that you're here.

4
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,640
 So glad that you're either here in this room with me right now

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
 or you're in the room where you are, maybe in your car

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,240
 listening through the app.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,000
 But we are so glad you are a part of this movement of God

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,440
 called The Porch.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,880
 Now, we're in this series called Asking for a Friend.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,960
 Asking for a Friend is a series where

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,540
 we take on some of the questions that are kind of hard to get

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,540
 really clear answers to.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,120
 Tonight, we're going to talk about what

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,360
 is the will of God for my life?

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,080
 What is the will of God for my life?

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,500
 So all the thousands of you are going to know exactly what

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,280
 to do next after this message.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,960
 OK, clearly not.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,080
 We can't do that much work.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,960
 But what we can do is we can approach the topic.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,720
 Now, I want to start here.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,040
 We've been in '90s mode around here

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,760
 because we're going to have a little thing called launch

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,080
 retreat really, really soon.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,720
 Those are your friends who are going.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,440
 If you're not going, you can go to Awakend Conference.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,520
 We're going to step it up next year anyway if you

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
 didn't make it around this time.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
 But we've all been into this '90s theme

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
 that we're going to do at launch over Labor Day weekend, which

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,120
 has got us thinking about stuff like this.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 You guys remember this?

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
 Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,620
 For those-- look, I know that there are three people right

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,820
 now that God loves who don't know what this is.

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,540
 And I want to make sure that all three of you

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,780
 know exactly what this is.

38
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,460
 This is a game called MASH, all right?

39
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,340
 Mansion, apartment, shack, house.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
 This is where you fill out the card with some

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,740
 of the options for your life.

42
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,700
 Get some good ones on there.

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,020
 Get some bad ones on there.

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,780
 You know, your mood, your house, your car,

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,060
 the boy you want to be with, or the girl you want to be with,

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
 or don't want to be with.

47
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,220
 It all makes the list.

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,160
 And then random chance happens, all right?

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,600
 If you didn't play MASH, maybe I could get you

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
 interested with one of these.

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,560
 You guys know this?

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,760
 Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,160
 You know, people just taunt you with this stuff.

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
 You're like-- somebody comes up to you.

55
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
 They're like, I know who you're going to marry.

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,440
 Pick a color.

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,680
 I'm like, all right.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,840
 All right, you know, blue.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,640
 You know, all right, B-L-U-E. All right, pick a number.

60
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,560
 Two, one, two.

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
 Pick another number, four.

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,800
 Ah, Sheila, ha, ha, ha, you know?

63
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,620
 People just like hate on you.

64
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,820
 Something terrible.

65
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,800
 You know, it's like, man, we're curious people

66
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,460
 about our future.

67
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,420
 If your name's Sheila, I'm sure you're fabulous.

68
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,620
 But I was just picking a name.

69
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,540
 But we're just naturally curious at a young age

70
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,380
 about our future.

71
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,900
 It's funny.

72
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,220
 Maybe you've seen one of these.

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,300
 Oh, my God.

74
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,780
 Oh, yeah.

75
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,260
 Some of you are like--

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,080
 some people are sitting at home right now shaking this thing

77
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,340
 instead of coming to the porch.

78
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,900
 You're like, OK, am I going to be rich or not?

79
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,080
 Answer hazy, ask later, no, you know?

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,480
 Even at a young age, we're really

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
 curious about our future.

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,800
 We're curious what the will of God might be for our life.

83
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400
 We're curious what the secret future that we've

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
 hoped to unlock might be.

85
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,280
 This is normal.

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,640
 And it's like, you're a kid.

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
 There's no chance you're going to get married.

88
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,520
 You have nothing.

89
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,580
 Why would you even think about this?

90
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,120
 But even then, we're curious about it.

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
 And here's the thing.

92
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
 We don't grow out of this.

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,560
 We're still curious what our next years might look like,

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,640
 aren't we?

95
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,740
 Except now, curveball, this is hard.

96
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,300
 Now you're an active decision maker in that.

97
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,620
 And that's a lot of pressure.

98
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,420
 Because now it's not just a play game with a piece of

99
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,780
 paper on a playground where you're like, oh, that's

100
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,980
 awesome, or it's really bad and you just kind of laugh it

101
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,500
 off and you move on.

102
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,740
 Now the decisions you make as you try to plot your way to

103
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,780
 the future, now they actually count.

104
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,060
 They go on the board of your life and they stay there.

105
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,900
 And so now you're an active participant.

106
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,760
 And what that creates is a little thing called anxiety.

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,360
 All right, so one of the biggest things that we hear

108
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,040
 consistently is I feel anxious about my future, whether it's

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,560
 related to my job or related to my marital life I hope

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
 exists one day or whether it relates to my family life or

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
 whether it relates to my current habits that I'm trying to

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
 break or build.

113
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,200
 But I just don't know the will of God for my life in that.

114
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,640
 And I've got a decision that's like pressing down on me.

115
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
 This is normal.

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
 OK, and even as even if you count yourself a follower of

117
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,480
 Jesus, even if you're here and you say, yes, I am trying to

118
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,360
 seek God's will for my life, like that's an active pursuit.

119
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,920
 It can still be hard.

120
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,560
 And when we get stuck, we have a bad habit of like making up

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
 weird stuff to try to clarify things for ourselves.

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
 You know, like, OK, who should I ask on a date?

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,680
 OK, God, if she smiles at me, it's her.

124
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,600
 All right, that's who it's going to be.

125
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,760
 And we just do we do these strange things.

126
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,280
 You know, we just grab our Bible and we're like, OK, God,

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
 whatever I read next is going to help me.

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
 Boom, we just open it and it says something like Jehoram

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,120
 was 32 years old when he became king and he reigned eight

130
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,000
 years, he passed away to no one's regret.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,680
 And you're looking at it like trying to make it work, you

132
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,760
 know, like, well, I'm I'm 32 and regret it, I guess.

133
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,280
 I don't know.

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,880
 Like I like I I'm trying to make this happen.

135
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,920
 And, you know, we don't have any way.

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,480
 And then you think, OK, you know what?

137
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
 I've been saved because the great theologian Drake has come

138
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,840
 out with a song called God's Plan.

139
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,280
 And then you listen to it and it is not indeed about God's

140
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,000
 plan.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,680
 And so you're still stuck.

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
 Finding God's will for your life is a hard pursuit.

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
 It's a difficult thing.

144
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,080
 And I know as we dive into this message, I just want to

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,960
 disappoint you early.

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,560
 I can't tell you if you have a really specific decision, I am

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,840
 not going to be able to tell you exactly what you should do

148
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,800
 next in a difficult to decipher situation.

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
 It's a difficult to decipher situation.

150
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,560
 All right.

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
 So some of you, if you hang on to every word trying to say, is

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,600
 he saying I should, you know, turn in my resignation letter

153
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,720
 or is he saying I should go ask for a raise?

154
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,000
 All right.

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,480
 You need to listen and understand what I'm going to

156
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,160
 try to do tonight is not answer all of your toughest questions

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
 because that would kind of be insulting.

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,760
 They're tough questions.

159
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,440
 What I'm going to try to do is give you a process where you

160
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,000
 can answer them over time by the will of God.

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
 What's the will of God for my life?

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,320
 I'm going to aim to answer three questions tonight.

163
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,080
 No vagueness, no weirdness, no grandma's wisdom, no signs in

164
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,920
 the clouds.

165
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,080
 Like, how do I find God's will?

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,440
 I'm going to try to answer three questions really clearly.

167
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,040
 Number one, how do I find the secret will of God?

168
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,360
 What I mean, the secret will of God, the will of God that he

169
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,200
 has planned for you that you don't know about yet, the

170
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,040
 secret will of God, the stuff you're naturally curious about,

171
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,640
 the decisions you have to make that you hope turn out really

172
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,520
 great, the blessings you hope you have, all right, the secret

173
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
 will of God.

174
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,600
 Number two, how do I find the revealed will of God?

175
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,960
 Because if he's already said something, that would be

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,560
 helpful.

177
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,880
 If he's already left a few breadcrumbs on the trail of

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,760
 what we should be doing, that would be a helpful place to

179
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,120
 start.

180
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,680
 So secondly, I'm going to answer, how do I find the

181
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,200
 revealed will of God?

182
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,440
 And then number three, how do I navigate the gray areas, the

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,720
 gray areas where it's not black and white, it doesn't seem like

184
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,800
 there's a clear yes or a clear no from God or the Bible, like

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
 what do I do in a gray area?

186
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,160
 Again, may not be able to give you an answer, but I'm going to

187
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,360
 provide from the scripture tonight a process.

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
 So let's jump in together.

189
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,480
 Number one, how do I find the secret will of God?

190
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,200
 I would love to go to one particular verse.

191
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,880
 It's very old.

192
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,000
 It's in Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible.

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,720
 And I'd love for us to get a look at it as we think through

194
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,240
 what is the secret will of God and how do I find it?

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
 And I find this verse helpful because it at least

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
 acknowledges the problem.

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
 You'll enjoy this.

198
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
 OK, if you feel the pressure of a decision or you don't know

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,280
 what God wants you to do next with your life, this will help.

200
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,280
 So here comes Deuteronomy 29, 29, the first half of it.

201
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,560
 It says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but

202
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,000
 the things that are revealed belong to us and to our

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,040
 children forever."

204
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,200
 And so that's helpful because the scripture at least is

205
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,040
 acknowledging that that exists.

206
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,360
 You're not supposed to know everything.

207
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,080
 The writer of this passage, Moses, 3,500 years ago, he

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
 didn't know everything.

209
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
 He didn't know everything that was going to happen in his

210
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,400
 life, his kid's life, his grandkids' life, the nation of

211
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,040
 Israel's life.

212
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,320
 He didn't.

213
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
 There was so much he didn't know.

214
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,240
 And he just had to say, "Look, some things are secret.

215
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
 They're closed to you.

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
 There's a lock on this.

217
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,680
 This is God's knowledge in here."

218
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
 OK, so this closed trunk represents the secret things

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,080
 that belong to God.

220
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,440
 In here included is everything God knows that you don't know

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,560
 and can't yet know.

222
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,320
 And also in here is all of your hopes.

223
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,600
 The hopes you hope are in the will of God.

224
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
 How awesome your spouse is going to be one day.

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
 How awesome your spouse--

226
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,560
 how much money your husband is going to make one day.

227
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,080
 All that secret hope you have and you don't know if it's the

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
 will of God, it's right there.

229
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
 Are you going to be able to successfully move

230
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
 up in your career?

231
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,440
 Are you going to be able to succeed in the environments

232
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
 that you hope you can succeed in?

233
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
 Are people going to like you?

234
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,480
 Are you going to get to live a significant amount of time?

235
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
 Is your life going to be cut short?

236
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,800
 All of these things are unknown by you.

237
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,520
 They're locked to you.

238
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,360
 But God knows them, which isn't a solution, but it at least

239
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,480
 acknowledges that we have a limitation.

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
 It says, "But the things that are revealed belong to us."

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
 So God hadn't kept everything a secret.

242
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
 He hadn't decided to completely conceal everything.

243
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
 There are some things you should really know.

244
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
 The revealed things belong to you.

245
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
 They're for you.

246
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,480
 They're for you and your kids forever.

247
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,520
 So the secret things are God's.

248
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,560
 We don't know how our future is going to turn out, but there

249
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,920
 are some things that have already been revealed.

250
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,440
 And let's be honest, it's interesting over here.

251
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
 Anybody ever want to hover around this?

252
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,800
 God, I wonder.

253
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,560
 God, I wonder what you're going to do.

254
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,880
 It's easy to hover right here, but look what the scripture

255
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,080
 says, Deuteronomy 29, 29, the second part of it.

256
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,640
 Secret things belong to God.

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
 The things that are revealed belong to us and to our

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
 children forever.

259
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
 And then look at this closely.

260
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,880
 "That," in other words, so that, "we may do all of the

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
 words of this law."

262
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
 What does he mean?

263
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
 Well, Deuteronomy is a book of the law.

264
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,040
 It's a book of God's revealed will.

265
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,600
 The word nom means law, deuteronomy.

266
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
 So the book of Deuteronomy is a book of God's will.

267
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,640
 And at the close to the end of this book of God's will, the

268
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
 author just says, look, there's some things we don't know.

269
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,760
 There's some things we do know.

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
 Conclusion, we're going to get really frustrated about the

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,120
 things we don't know, and we're going to really sweat it.

272
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,480
 And we're really going to get anxious.

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,280
 And we're really going to get worried.

274
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,360
 And we're really going to ask God to let us into this.

275
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,160
 God, I really need to know now.

276
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,800
 No, he says, what we're going to do instead, the reason it

277
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,120
 works like this is not so we can complain or be frustrated

278
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,880
 or be filled with anxiety or just paralysis by analysis and

279
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,440
 just get nervous and let our life collapse

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,000
 under the pressure.

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,760
 No, he says, the things that are revealed belong to us so

282
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,280
 that we can focus our energy here so that we can spend our

283
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,840
 time thinking about what we do know, not panicking over what

284
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,800
 we don't know.

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,080
 And by the way, this should be some of your first memory

286
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,440
 verse right now, like the first verse you ever memorized.

287
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,840
 If you've never memorized the verse start to finish, you

288
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,120
 should memorize this one because it will tell you that

289
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,960
 your energy and focus should go here because here's what we

290
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,240
 like to do right now.

291
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,280
 OK, it says right there, you know, flee from sexual

292
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
 immorality.

293
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
 I'm going to keep sleeping with my boyfriend, but then I'm

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,520
 going to go over here and be like, God, is he the one?

295
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
 Could it be?

296
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
 Is this my husband?

297
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
 Is this the person I'm supposed to be with?

298
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,520
 We like to do stuff like this.

299
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,800
 It says you cannot serve God and money.

300
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
 God made that really clear.

301
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
 You can't serve God and money.

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,760
 It's impossible.

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,320
 But you think, oh, no, no, don't worry about that.

304
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,760
 I got to make millionaire before 30.

305
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
 I understand.

306
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
 And so, God, but out here, are you going to give me a lot of

307
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,520
 money later so I can be generous later?

308
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,280
 And you look past what God's already said, hoping to go get

309
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,680
 some more of what you say you want.

310
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,800
 And it sounds like God language, you know, you're like,

311
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,640
 oh, God's will, God's will, God.

312
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,880
 It's all about you, God.

313
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,280
 But you're passing up what God's will already has been

314
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
 said to you.

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
 You've already missed it.

316
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
 This happens in all kinds of areas.

317
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,400
 It says in the scripture, whatever you do, work for the

318
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,560
 Lord and not for men.

319
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:11,920
 Right.

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,760
 Whatever you do.

321
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,480
 So whatever your job is, work hard.

322
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,120
 Whatever you do, work as to the Lord and not to men.

323
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,880
 And we go, oh, OK, no, no, no.

324
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,760
 My boss is a sinner.

325
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,920
 So you must not understand God.

326
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,960
 But am I going to get to be the boss one day?

327
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,040
 I wonder.

328
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,360
 And we wreck our lives.

329
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,160
 No exaggeration.

330
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,520
 We wreck our lives because we're so curious about the

331
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,200
 secret will of God.

332
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,160
 And the scripture could not be any more clear.

333
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,040
 This is interesting and important.

334
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
 The things you hope for yourself, they're

335
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,920
 important to God.

336
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,160
 That's why they're in there.

337
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
 You just can't know them.

338
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
 The scripture could not be more clear.

339
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,840
 Focus your energy right here.

340
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,000
 Look right here.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,400
 What has God said and what could you do today to be

342
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,640
 faithful?

343
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,280
 There was a time in my life when I was struggling with

344
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,680
 this in a significant way before age about 21, I didn't

345
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,000
 really care about the will of God.

346
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,840
 I just kind of did whatever I wanted before I was 16.

347
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,560
 I had already dabbled in drugs, sex, porn, alcohol.

348
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,640
 I'd kind of just gone as far as I could go while still

349
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
 being able to live under my father's roof.

350
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
 Thank God for him who kept me standing up at least a

351
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
 little straight.

352
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,080
 But I went pretty much as far as a teenager can go under

353
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,680
 the influence of my older brother and just the wrong

354
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
 crowd. And so that's kind of the direction I went.

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
 I didn't care anything about the will of God.

356
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
 I would have never said that.

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 Well, by the time I got to my early 20s, I'd become a

358
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,960
 believer. And God, I realized I embraced grace for my

359
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,040
 past. I started to try to walk with Christ.

360
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
 And what started to happen was I started to care about

361
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
 the will of God.

362
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,280
 I started to care about this conversation that we're

363
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,440
 having. And naturally, I went straight over here.

364
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,840
 God, what do you want to do through my life?

365
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,680
 God, what?

366
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
 And I'd pace my kitchen.

367
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,640
 No lie.

368
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,400
 My roommates could tell you I would pace my kitchen.

369
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
 I'm talking about late at night.

370
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,160
 And I'm like, I want to do something great for God.

371
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,000
 I would say this out loud.

372
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
 And it may not sound humble.

373
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,680
 It's probably not.

374
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,880
 But I would just say, ah, I want to do something great

375
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
 for God.

376
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
 Like all this angsty energy.

377
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,400
 I just want to do something great for God.

378
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,320
 I don't know what I should do, though.

379
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,160
 What should I do?

380
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,000
 Should I do this?

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
 Should I do that?

382
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,320
 Yeah, I just graduated college and I want to do something

383
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
 for God.

384
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,600
 What should I do?

385
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,000
 Well, a few years later, I ended up getting to serve

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,680
 here at Watermark in the residency program.

387
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,920
 And our senior pastor, Todd, took us all to breakfast

388
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,800
 at one point so we could get some time with him

389
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,960
 and hear, take some notes on what he had to share with us

390
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
 as we were going through this residency program.

391
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,920
 And at that breakfast, he was sitting right across from me.

392
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,000
 He said, you know, here's another thing.

393
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,920
 I hear these young guys say they want to do something

394
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
 great for God.

395
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,520
 And I look back at him like, unbelievable.

396
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
 I can't.

397
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,280
 Infants, you know, wow.

398
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,360
 And he said, you know what I never hear?

399
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,080
 I never hear somebody say, you know what I want to do?

400
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,160
 I just want to be faithful today.

401
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,360
 That's what I want to do with my life.

402
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,680
 I want to be faithful today.

403
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
 And I'll figure out tomorrow when it gets here,

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,240
 but I just want to be faithful today.

405
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,440
 And it was one of those moments where I didn't,

406
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,840
 I didn't want to say anything because I knew I'd been making

407
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,600
 the exact error that he had been,

408
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,400
 he was just talking about, looking me right in the face.

409
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,640
 But it was a moment I'll never forget because I realized

410
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,360
 I am expending a huge amount of energy right now,

411
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,320
 trying to get into the next specific thing God is trying

412
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
 to tell me, which is not a bad prayer to say, God,

413
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
 what's your will for my life?

414
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,680
 But if I'm obsessing over me, eventually it starts

415
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,200
 to become clear I'm obsessing over me.

416
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,760
 When God's given me plenty to obsess over right here.

417
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,160
 Our friend JP has said this in a really clear way

418
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,040
 that I think is really helpful.

419
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
 He's got a book coming out, by the way, September 4th.

420
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
 It's extremely exciting.

421
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,400
 This is called Welcome to Adulting.

422
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,480
 All right, Welcome to Adulting.

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
 Very, very helpful.

424
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,560
 You should definitely pick it up on September 4th.

425
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,120
 You may be even able to pre-order.

426
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
 And I'm not just saying that 'cause he's my friend.

427
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,200
 I'm saying it because this content is a shaping

428
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
 of the word of God that changed my life.

429
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,560
 All right, so here's the way he says it.

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
 I can't say it any better than this.

431
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,000
 You might think it's arrogant that I could claim

432
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
 to know the plan for your life.

433
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,080
 However, what I've realized is that God has a plan

434
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,440
 for everyone's life.

435
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,840
 God has a plan for everyone's life.

436
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,800
 But most people ignore it.

437
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,960
 They know the basic things God wants everyone to do,

438
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,800
 but they choose not to do them.

439
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,760
 And if you ignore the general plan

440
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,120
 God has already made clear,

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
 why should he bother to give you more specific instructions?

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
 Why would it be that we would think God's gonna reveal

443
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,920
 something to us when we aren't listening

444
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,320
 to what he already revealed?

445
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,280
 I mean, let's be honest.

446
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
 I'm not trying to hit you over the head,

447
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,200
 but I mean, let's be honest.

448
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
 If we're on our knees praying,

449
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,760
 God, please show me what to do.

450
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,840
 God, please show me what to do.

451
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,880
 God, please show me what to do.

452
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,520
 When you're in a willful rebellion

453
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,400
 against what he's shown you to do,

454
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
 why would you think he's gonna give you more revelation?

455
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,320
 Why would you think he's gonna unlock doors for you

456
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
 if you're not willfully engaging

457
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,560
 in what he's telling you to do?

458
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,320
 You find the secret will of God

459
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,000
 by obeying the obvious will of God today.

460
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
 That's how you get started.

461
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,080
 If you wanna know the secret will of God for your life,

462
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 you get started by obeying the obvious will of God today.

463
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,280
 Don't be weighed down by anxiety.

464
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
 Anxiety and obsession about the future,

465
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,960
 sometimes it's always a trap,

466
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,640
 and sometimes it's just narcissism, frankly,

467
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,560
 'cause we're obsessed over our own little thing,

468
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
 and we want to know that it's gonna look just right

469
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
 out there in the future, the way we want it to.

470
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
 God, is it gonna work out the exact way I want?

471
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,760
 The answer is, man, I don't know.

472
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,240
 I know it's not gonna work out the way God wants

473
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,000
 if you don't start here with the scripture.

474
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,040
 Find the secret will of God

475
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,520
 by starting with the obvious will of God.

476
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,600
 So secondly, then, that means we should start.

477
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,240
 Well, where do I start?

478
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,080
 I mean, the whole Bible,

479
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,280
 I mean, this is a little bit overwhelming.

480
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,120
 Wouldn't you agree?

481
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,520
 66 books, all these pages, all these different things,

482
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
 and it's unclear sometimes as to what you should actually do

483
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,120
 when you read it.

484
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,600
 So at this point, we should be asking,

485
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,160
 what is the revealed will of God?

486
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,680
 If that's my step one, if that's where I should start,

487
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
 where do I start?

488
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,320
 Because it's a long book.

489
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
 It's a set of books.

490
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,320
 And so how, tell me where I start.

491
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
 And what I wanna do in the second point

492
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,120
 is I wanna give you just a little starter kit.

493
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,760
 Five areas of life that really matter to you and to God

494
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,320
 that you can know for sure is the will of God for you.

495
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 And if you're going, okay, look,

496
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,400
 I wanna know that God's got my future in every single way,

497
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
 but help me, I mean, just pull out something helpful

498
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
 so I can know what I can start to do today.

499
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
 Here it is, number one, really simple.

500
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,240
 Follow Jesus.

501
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,280
 Follow Jesus, John 14, 21.

502
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,280
 If you love me, this is the words of Jesus.

503
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,720
 If you love me, you'll obey my teaching.

504
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,440
 I love that because he said it in a way we can understand.

505
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,520
 If you love me, you'll obey my teaching.

506
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,040
 Not you'll come to the porch

507
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,120
 and then you'll go get drunk the next weekend.

508
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,660
 Not you'll come and pay lip service to me,

509
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,960
 lift your hands in worship,

510
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,000
 and then lift your hands to some other unholy desire

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,720
 that you have in your life.

512
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
 He's saying, if you love me, obey my teaching.

513
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,880
 He's not talking about perfection, by the way,

514
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
 because he knows we're not perfect.

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
 He's perfect, he's talking about the right direction.

516
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,720
 All right?

517
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
 If you love me, obey my teaching.

518
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,260
 So follow Jesus.

519
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,600
 Don't try to be down with Jesus

520
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,360
 and also down with six Mambo taxis.

521
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,680
 It's not gonna happen.

522
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,720
 Don't try to do both.

523
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,800
 Be down with Jesus.

524
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,540
 Walk with him, follow him.

525
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,520
 Number two, work hard no matter what your job is.

526
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,840
 Work hard no matter what your job is.

527
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,480
 Here's a place to start, Colossians 3:23.

528
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
 Whatever you do, I mentioned it earlier,

529
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,720
 whatever you do, work heartily,

530
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,840
 with your whole heart, with your whole soul,

531
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,640
 work heartily, ask for the Lord and not for men.

532
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,420
 Not for people, in other words.

533
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,800
 This is saying something that's crazier than you think.

534
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,520
 It's saying you should treat your boss

535
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,840
 as if he or she was Jesus.

536
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,320
 It's saying that if some, it's as if Jesus said to you,

537
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,280
 "Hey, can you put that on my desk by the morning?"

538
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,480
 It's as if Jesus is saying to you,

539
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,680
 "Hey, could you not be late anymore?"

540
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,140
 It's as if Jesus is saying to you,

541
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,440
 "Hey, you seem a little down,

542
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,080
 "could you have a little more chipper attitude?"

543
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
 You know, company culture kinda matters.

544
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,060
 As if Jesus was saying these things to you.

545
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,680
 That's how we should respond.

546
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,640
 Follow Jesus, work hard no matter what your job is.

547
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,360
 Number three, commit to a church.

548
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,200
 Commit to a church.

549
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,820
 Hebrews 13, 17 says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them."

550
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,400
 Obey your spiritual leaders.

551
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,560
 This is referring to the, when it says spiritual leaders,

552
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,680
 it's referring to the elders, the men who follow Christ here

553
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,800
 who also get a chance to lead us.

554
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,220
 Why, because they have some secret access to God?

555
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,080
 No, but because they pay attention so closely

556
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,400
 to what God's already said for themselves and for us.

557
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,580
 You should find some healthy biblical leaders.

558
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,680
 Doesn't have to be here,

559
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,080
 there are great churches everywhere,

560
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,620
 but find some healthy leaders that you know

561
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,920
 are leading towards Christ

562
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,660
 and entrust your spirituality to them.

563
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,720
 Every one of us needs to be under authority.

564
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,620
 That is distinctly different, by the way,

565
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,680
 submitting to a church, committing to a church,

566
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,020
 is distinctly different from critiquing a church.

567
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,320
 Very different from critiquing a church.

568
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,940
 And some of you, you're like a movie critic,

569
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,200
 you know, church version.

570
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,800
 You know, and like everything you do, you just can't help.

571
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,840
 Maybe it's a critical spirit,

572
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,920
 but you're just somehow in this rut of like,

573
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,040
 oh man, they really didn't figure out the parking out here.

574
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,120
 Man, this is really bad.

575
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
 It's hot, should we even be doing this when it's hot?

576
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,080
 You know, we've got to walk a long way.

577
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,920
 That music was a little,

578
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,680
 I didn't hear any of my favorite songs, you know?

579
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,320
 And then, oh my gosh, it's not even JP.

580
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,240
 (congregation laughing)

581
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
 Oh man.

582
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,800
 Don't worry, I'm glad to see you guys too.

583
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,720
 But listen, truly, it doesn't matter.

584
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,040
 It doesn't matter if you hear the thing you wanted to hear,

585
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,200
 if the coffee tastes the way you want it to taste,

586
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,840
 if you're a favorite communicator,

587
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
 and it's okay to enjoy the teaching

588
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,160
 and the service of certain people.

589
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,920
 I certainly enjoy the service and teaching

590
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,580
 of the other people who stand up here,

591
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,760
 but I just want to tell you,

592
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,280
 it's about your access to God all the time.

593
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,800
 Not about who's playing what role

594
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
 and whether it's to your liking.

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,940
 Commit to a church.

596
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,240
 It's gonna be imperfect.

597
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
 It's gonna have bumps and bruises

598
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
 and it's gonna have problems

599
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,760
 'cause after all, now you're in it, okay?

600
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,240
 So it is going to have, it is not gonna be perfect.

601
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,840
 And imperfect people were there before you, of course.

602
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,480
 So find a church and just dive in, all right?

603
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,720
 Number four.

604
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,960
 This one kept me away from God for a long time.

605
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,300
 Here it is, are you ready?

606
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,720
 Pursue sexual purity.

607
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,040
 1 Thessalonians 4, three through five.

608
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,460
 You know how sometimes you really want the Bible

609
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,280
 to be clear and then it is clear and you're like,

610
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,680
 ah, I wish it wasn't so clear.

611
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,400
 I had this experience when I was in high school.

612
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,360
 That happened to me, okay?

613
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,180
 I literally walked in, it was a sexual purity night.

614
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,680
 That's what they were talking about.

615
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,640
 And this guy is up there talking about,

616
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,840
 listen, sexual purity means no masturbation,

617
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,240
 no oral sex, definitely no hookups.

618
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,360
 And it's sexual pleasure and connection

619
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
 is between a man and a woman in marriage.

620
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,560
 And I'm 17 years old listening to him like,

621
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,600
 bro, you just shut down my whole operation.

622
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,440
 All right, I got, dude, I got nowhere to turn

623
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,280
 with you right now.

624
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,480
 And seriously, I'm making light of it,

625
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
 but my heart was in such a spiritual place

626
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
 that I heard this verse and I walked out.

627
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,920
 I left.

628
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
 Like there was a little time where all of my peers

629
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,820
 and all the people that were in the rows around me

630
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,680
 could walk forward and like make a pledge.

631
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,440
 Yes, I agree to sexual purity with Christ.

632
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,980
 And I walked upstream out of the back of the church.

633
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,700
 Because I just thought that, I just thought,

634
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,940
 you know what, I don't even care what's in this box for me.

635
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,380
 You know, I can make up something better than God,

636
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,300
 you know, that was where my heart was.

637
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,060
 And I thank God that he saved me from that

638
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,700
 and changed my mind.

639
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,620
 But here's the verse, "For this is the will of God,

640
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,780
 your sanctification."

641
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,340
 So let there be no doubt, all right,

642
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,600
 this is the will of God, your sanctification,

643
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,020
 that you abstain from sexual immorality,

644
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,820
 that each one of you know how to control his own body

645
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,960
 and holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust,

646
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,840
 like the people who don't know God.

647
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,660
 So if you know God, if you're trying to follow Jesus,

648
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,940
 he wants you to handle your sexuality as if you know Jesus,

649
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,260
 who created sex for a place, he created it for a purpose

650
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
 and for a context.

651
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,100
 And I'll tell you what,

652
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,300
 coming out of a lot of sexual immorality,

653
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,440
 I'm not the guy without a past, as I just said.

654
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,300
 And I'm telling you, what happened to me is I just decided

655
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,020
 I'm gonna test and see,

656
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,260
 because right now that sounds terrible, all right,

657
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,960
 but I'm gonna test and see, and you know what happened?

658
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,180
 Holiness and honor started to come into my life,

659
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,700
 and drama and discouragement started to leave my life,

660
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,540
 because that's what sexual sin is always gonna turn into,

661
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,900
 some kind of drama or some kind of discouragement,

662
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,460
 because you weren't created for it.

663
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,320
 That's not why God made you that way.

664
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,780
 Pursue sexual purity.

665
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,560
 And then lastly, what else is the revealed will of God?

666
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
 If we wanna get into the secret will of God,

667
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,720
 if we wanna find out what our future with God is

668
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,760
 and could be, what do we start with?

669
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,880
 Number five, do the right thing, even if it costs you.

670
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,600
 First Peter 4:19,

671
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,860
 "Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will,"

672
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,240
 so that will tell you right there,

673
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,120
 "it is in the will of God

674
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,200
 "that there will be some hard stuff in your life."

675
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,120
 Some people teach a terrible heresy,

676
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,200
 that if you become a Christian,

677
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,400
 then everything just gets easy, you know?

678
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
 No health problems, no money problems,

679
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
 no problems problems, you're just fine, all right?

680
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,160
 And that's what they teach, and it is false,

681
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,080
 because it says right here,

682
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,300
 "Let those who suffer according to God's will,

683
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,580
 "there will be hardship in your life."

684
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,640
 I went to my brother's funeral,

685
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,640
 I went to my mom's funeral, I've seen hard stuff, all right?

686
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,160
 And I don't know if that's a lot to you or a little to you.

687
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,000
 I just know that suffering is gonna happen

688
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
 even as a Christian, but listen to what it says.

689
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,440
 "Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will

690
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,440
 "entrust their souls to a faithful creator while doing good."

691
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,520
 So don't shut down the good just because the opposition

692
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,720
 or the hate comes from the other side.

693
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,120
 Keep trusting God and entrust yourself to him fully

694
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
 while you keep doing good.

695
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,280
 Here's what that means.

696
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,520
 If your boss comes to you and is like,

697
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,940
 "Look, man, I understand you got the religion thing,

698
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,220
 "but you're gonna have to put that on the table

699
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,200
 "for a second because we go to the strip club

700
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
 "every quarter for the getaway retreat, okay?

701
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,240
 "So if you don't come to the strip club,

702
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,920
 "you don't have a job."

703
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,520
 According to 1 Peter 4, 19, your response is,

704
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,320
 "Well, it sounds like you just made my choice for me.

705
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,280
 "I don't have a job because I can't disobey

706
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,480
 "what the scripture tells me."

707
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,060
 Ladies, if a guy comes to you and is like,

708
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,320
 "Hey," if you start to get the vibe in the relationship,

709
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,840
 rather, maybe it's not said directly,

710
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
 but if you start to get the vibe in a relationship

711
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,440
 that it's like, hey, you either kinda give sex

712
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,760
 or at least some sexual favors to keep him interested

713
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,280
 or he's disinterested, you should go ahead

714
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,240
 and disinterest yourself.

715
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,120
 You should go ahead and move away from that.

716
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,940
 Why?

717
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,720
 Because you would rather pay the cost

718
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
 of losing your relationship with a man, any man,

719
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,280
 than losing your relationship with God.

720
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,360
 It's not worth it, all right?

721
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,220
 So entrust yourself to God.

722
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,160
 It takes trust.

723
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,480
 I know that sounds like a leap in the dark.

724
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,160
 If you got some opposition in your face

725
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,240
 and you know what you gotta do

726
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,440
 and you don't know how it's gonna turn out, that's hard,

727
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,460
 but it is in the revealed will of God for you

728
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,400
 that you do the right thing when it costs you

729
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,560
 for the name and fame of Christ.

730
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
 Okay, I'll just pause there.

731
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,980
 Five things, work, church, sexuality, spirituality,

732
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,480
 some major areas of life.

733
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,680
 And technically, the whole Bible is the revealed will of God.

734
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,600
 So anywhere you find a command in the Bible,

735
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,040
 you could get busy doing it and that would be a good idea.

736
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,840
 But if you're like, just get me started, man,

737
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,040
 that might be enough for some of you to tackle

738
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,600
 for the rest of the year, alone.

739
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,260
 And think about this.

740
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,280
 How different would your life be

741
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,400
 if you just did those five things?

742
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,320
 How different would it be?

743
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,020
 Step into a world where that's you.

744
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,200
 Step into a world where it wasn't a democracy

745
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
 between you and Jesus anymore,

746
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,920
 it was just you did what he said.

747
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,520
 How much better would you sleep?

748
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,460
 How much more peace would you have?

749
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,880
 How much more respect would you find from other people?

750
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,440
 How much do you wish your parents had done these things?

751
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,940
 How much do your siblings wish you would do these things?

752
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,060
 This is powerful stuff.

753
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,680
 Jesus doesn't hold that, you don't have to walk

754
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,520
 with Jesus 10 years to get to the good stuff,

755
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,040
 you can start right now.

756
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,320
 And if you start to bring your life

757
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,840
 into the revealed will of God,

758
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,320
 there's no telling what he might do next.

759
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,200
 So number three.

760
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,140
 You okay, how do I navigate the gray areas?

761
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,420
 Number three, how do I navigate the gray areas?

762
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,400
 Because there's a revealed will of God,

763
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,580
 sometimes it's black and white and I should just do it.

764
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,260
 Great, and we're saying that that's the way

765
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,560
 I'm gonna get in to find the future that God wants for me

766
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,020
 and the blessings I hope are there.

767
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,180
 But sometimes there's just gray issues in life.

768
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,580
 Let me give you an example.

769
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,780
 I'm wearing gray shoes right now, no coincidence.

770
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,660
 I got black ones, I got blue ones.

771
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,140
 God didn't whisper to me this morning,

772
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,300
 wear the gray ones.

773
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,060
 Maybe God and you have that kind of connection,

774
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,260
 I don't know.

775
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,200
 I only hear God speak when I read the Bible out loud,

776
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,040
 to quote a friend.

777
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,340
 So I don't know if you hear from God in that way,

778
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,460
 but I just picked and I felt free to do it.

779
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,020
 But what happens when the gray decision

780
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,660
 gets a little more serious?

781
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,400
 Like, who should I marry?

782
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,900
 I mean, the only black and white thing

783
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,460
 the Bible really says about that is,

784
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,180
 don't marry an unbeliever, if you're a follower of Christ.

785
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,860
 And then it tells you what character looks like

786
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,220
 in a woman, specifically in Proverbs 31,

787
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,580
 and in a man, pretty much throughout

788
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
 the rest of the Bible, all right?

789
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,980
 And so, and you just, and after that,

790
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,100
 it's like, happy hunting, you know what I mean?

791
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,460
 Who should I, who should I marry?

792
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,060
 Like, I don't know, I have to tell you.

793
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,180
 God never like, God didn't wake me up

794
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,940
 in the middle of the night and tell me my wife's name,

795
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,780
 all right, whenever we were just like dating or single.

796
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,960
 It was never like, I didn't get woken up

797
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,220
 in the middle of the night like, it's Gabby.

798
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,180
 That never happened.

799
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,120
 What happened was, I could see that her character

800
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,660
 seemed to match the character that God said was important.

801
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,340
 And over time, it became clear, but it was gray for a time.

802
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,620
 Until of course, I got to know her and it was clarified.

803
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,900
 But that would be a good idea in honoring to God.

804
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,940
 Some of you are like, I don't know

805
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,560
 whether to quit my job or not.

806
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,280
 That's gray, it seems like I could find

807
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,860
 some biblical reasons to do that.

808
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,380
 I could also find some justifications to stay.

809
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,900
 I mean, that's a heavier gray decision, if you will,

810
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,860
 not specifically called out in scripture.

811
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
 So what do you do?

812
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,980
 I wanna give you four questions you can ask yourself

813
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,260
 to help you get an answer.

814
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,980
 I don't know for your situation

815
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,780
 'cause I don't know what it is, all right,

816
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,300
 but I can give you a few questions

817
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,180
 that will help clarify it for you, should I?

818
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,380
 Should I go on vacation with my boyfriend or girlfriend?

819
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,420
 Should I marry my boyfriend or girlfriend?

820
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,620
 Should I go to this specific bachelor party?

821
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,020
 And you can think up other examples

822
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,860
 that are relevant to your life

823
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,700
 that I'm not creative enough to come up with.

824
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,260
 But here are a few questions you could ask yourself.

825
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,480
 Number one, will it be good for my faith?

826
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,780
 Will it be good for my faith?

827
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,300
 Will it be a step in the right direction for my spirituality?

828
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 First Corinthians 10, 23 says,

829
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,420
 "All things may be lawful,

830
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,360
 "but not all things edify or build up."

831
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
 So there may be something that you'd go,

832
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,380
 hey, that place in town,

833
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,900
 the Bible doesn't say don't go there.

834
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,820
 But it's not good for me.

835
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,500
 I just know in my most honest moment,

836
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,560
 it's not good for me.

837
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,860
 There are things you can eat, drink, and do

838
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,180
 that the Bible might not specifically say no to.

839
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,460
 But if you were gonna have your most honest moment,

840
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,840
 you know, your most honest moment with God,

841
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,020
 they're not good for you, okay?

842
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,980
 So should you go to the bachelor party?

843
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,660
 I don't know.

844
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,080
 Is it your community group guys

845
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,180
 that have been tracking with,

846
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,660
 that you've been tracking with and love God

847
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,820
 and you guys are gonna go get away

848
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,020
 and it's gonna be a really encouraging time for all of you

849
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,060
 and you guys are gonna pray for the guy

850
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,380
 you're sending off to marriage

851
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,740
 and you're gonna come back ready to pray

852
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,620
 for a godly spouse and be more like the guy

853
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,380
 that you're sending off?

854
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,740
 That doesn't sound problematic.

855
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,940
 Is it the college buddies that you know

856
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,300
 what kind of environment it's gonna be

857
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,700
 and you suspect that maybe God's not doing everything

858
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,140
 in their life that God's trying to urge you to do

859
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,660
 and you know when you get there,

860
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,720
 the magnetism and the momentum of that old friend group

861
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,660
 is kind of gonna move you in the wrong direction?

862
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,540
 Is it that?

863
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,980
 Maybe not.

864
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,160
 But you have to figure that out for yourself.

865
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,120
 Will it be good for my faith?

866
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,460
 Number two, could it become addictive?

867
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,440
 Could it become addictive for you?

868
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,700
 First Corinthians 6:12 says,

869
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,580
 "All things are lawful for me,

870
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,560
 "but I won't be mastered by anything."

871
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,860
 Think about this.

872
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,300
 Is it possible that there are things in the world

873
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,260
 that the Bible doesn't specifically forbid

874
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,620
 that could trap you?

875
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,900
 Are there things in this world

876
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,200
 that the Bible doesn't say you can't do that?

877
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,560
 And you go, "Oh, freedom in Christ."

878
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,620
 And then all of a sudden you are trapped.

879
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,480
 Answer is yes.

880
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
 Let me give you a really common example

881
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,520
 and invest a second of time here.

882
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,100
 Alcohol.

883
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,560
 What does the Bible say about alcohol?

884
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
 Some of you really want me to say right now

885
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,840
 that you can't drink.

886
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,080
 And some of you really right now

887
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,880
 want me to give you permission to drink

888
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,000
 as much as you want, all right?

889
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
 Some of you are listening for both ways.

890
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,200
 And here's what I wanna tell you.

891
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,180
 Does the Bible specifically forbid alcohol?

892
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,820
 No.

893
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,340
 Does the Bible forbid drunkenness?

894
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
 Yes.

895
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,100
 Very clearly.

896
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,660
 And you go, "Well, where's the line?"

897
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,040
 I say, "I don't know, but I know this.

898
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,420
 "More people say free, and then they end up trapped

899
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,540
 "than people who say, ooh, that could lead to bondage.

900
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,480
 "I'll just stay back."

901
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,280
 There are more people who don't play it safe enough.

902
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,540
 All right, and so there are many of you

903
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,220
 who I'm telling you, you don't see any argument

904
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,300
 in the Bible that you can't drink,

905
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,260
 but you know if you're being really honest for you,

906
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,740
 for you, not for everyone, for you,

907
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,700
 you never have interacted well with it.

908
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,860
 Doesn't mean God's saying it's a sin carte blanche.

909
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,820
 It just means you've never interacted well with it.

910
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,660
 And this is a problem area for you.

911
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,460
 Not 'cause the Bible says it has to be,

912
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,700
 but because of your weakness, it just is.

913
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,860
 And what I see really commonly is young adults

914
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,380
 who cry freedom in Christ on the way to bondage.

915
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,640
 So be thoughtful.

916
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,940
 Could it become addictive?

917
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,300
 Number three, will it confuse or tempt other people?

918
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,840
 So if you're gonna do something,

919
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,320
 if you're asking, oh, should I do blank,

920
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,440
 will people come up to you afterward and be like,

921
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,240
 I thought you were trying to do the Christian thing now?

922
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,520
 If you eat that, do that, drink that, choose that,

923
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,300
 hang with that person or with that group of people, go there.

924
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
 If you make that choice,

925
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,740
 are people gonna be tempted to come up to you

926
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,460
 and be like, huh, I can't really put the dots together here.

927
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,260
 Will it tempt someone else?

928
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,500
 Back to the alcohol conversation.

929
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
 Another common mistake is someone who truly is free.

930
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,460
 The scripture doesn't explicitly forbid having a drink

931
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,180
 and a person doesn't particularly find it

932
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,900
 to be a temptation of any kind.

933
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
 For them, it's like Dr. Pepper beer.

934
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,740
 It's the same.

935
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,040
 You're not tempted for whatever reason.

936
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,920
 Many of you wish that was you and it's not you,

937
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,860
 I'm telling you, but there are people who exist

938
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,780
 that are free in that way

939
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,980
 and can interact with alcohol appropriately.

940
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,340
 Okay, sometimes the person who says that says,

941
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,160
 oh, I'm free in Christ and just 'cause you don't drink,

942
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,460
 I'm still gonna have a drink in front of you

943
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,360
 and that's not loving either.

944
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,440
 Does that make sense?

945
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,800
 So even if you are free to exercise some freedom,

946
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,140
 I'm free to do that, I'm free to make that choice,

947
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,040
 will it discourage someone else?

948
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,300
 Will it bother someone else?

949
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,340
 I have friends who don't interact well with alcohol.

950
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,300
 Guess what?

951
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,580
 It's never around them

952
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,140
 because they have a loving community around them

953
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,820
 who are thinking not just of my freedom,

954
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,540
 but what would be loving for the other people

955
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,500
 in the environment.

956
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,740
 That's when you make a huge shift in your spirituality.

957
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,460
 When you go from what's my freedom to,

958
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,080
 hey, what would bless everybody here?

959
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,700
 That's what will change the game for you.

960
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,740
 So if you've got a decision to make,

961
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
 you can think through that.

962
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,120
 Number four, lastly,

963
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,140
 would it honor God the most out of all my options?

964
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,220
 Out of all my options, whatever my options are,

965
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,300
 would it honor God the most?

966
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,600
 And this is the one that we easily think about,

967
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,580
 but we don't really pause to do it.

968
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,740
 It's easy for this to come to mind,

969
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,660
 yeah, I wanna glorify God in everything I do,

970
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,060
 but we don't really stop to think.

971
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,860
 If Jesus was standing here right beside me,

972
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,060
 would you turn to him and be like,

973
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,900
 you know, Jesus, it's really all about you

974
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,420
 and whether or not I stay at this job,

975
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,500
 it's really not even up to me.

976
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,460
 What would honor you the most out of all my options?

977
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,420
 What would make you look great?

978
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,480
 What would make you famous?

979
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,060
 And that might clarify a few things.

980
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,460
 Would it honor God the most out of all my options?

981
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,380
 There was a time when I would have said

982
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,620
 that God didn't care about my future.

983
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,300
 And I'll close by sharing this with you.

984
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,660
 There was a time when I would have said,

985
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,740
 I don't think, honestly,

986
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,100
 that God really cares about me.

987
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,700
 For a lot of reasons.

988
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,320
 One, he's big, you know, and he's busy.

989
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,540
 And so maybe he's got so many other important things

990
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,140
 to take care of, like, you know, good people,

991
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,400
 that he wouldn't care about a future like mine.

992
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,540
 Or maybe it's just because I've done so many bad things.

993
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,420
 I've done so much, I've gone a little too far,

994
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,160
 whatever the limit was,

995
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,980
 to have God still interested in your life

996
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,880
 from this point forward.

997
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,460
 I clearly kind of turned my back on that,

998
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
 and I've gone too far.

999
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,380
 So I don't know where the line is,

1000
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,980
 but I'm on the wrong side of it.

1001
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,860
 And then I would think, you know what,

1002
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,420
 maybe God, maybe when I was born, you know,

1003
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,940
 God had a wonderful plan for my life,

1004
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,940
 but that's clearly gone.

1005
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,740
 And now I'm just trying to do damage control

1006
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,880
 so I can maybe get second or third or fifth best.

1007
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,440
 And it's kind of the mode I was in.

1008
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,220
 I just thought, God, there's no way God

1009
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,380
 could really be interested in me.

1010
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,380
 Maybe God loves me, because after all,

1011
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,720
 he's God, he's supposed to love everyone,

1012
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,420
 but I don't get the feeling that God would like me very much.

1013
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,320
 That's how I felt.

1014
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,440
 And if you've ever felt that way,

1015
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,740
 as you look out at your future,

1016
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,620
 and you're going, what's the will of God for my life,

1017
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,700
 and I'm not getting answers from the preachers,

1018
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,980
 he's giving me more questions to ask,

1019
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,380
 like, God, are you gonna help me with the future or not?

1020
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,820
 And if you feel alone when you look out like that,

1021
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,060
 you might've been tempted to read the Bible like I did.

1022
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,660
 I used to read the Bible a little bit like this,

1023
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,180
 and this might be where you find yourself.

1024
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,260
 I'm going, where's the talk about my future?

1025
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,100
 I mean, where?

1026
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,460
 You know, I got, in the beginning,

1027
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,540
 God created the heavens and the earth.

1028
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,660
 It's great, it's not my future.

1029
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,460
 Noah in the ark, good story, not my future.

1030
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
 Good boat, not my future.

1031
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:04,300
 Another cool story, not about me, not about my future.

1032
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,080
 Okay, here are some Psalms now.

1033
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,540
 I got some poetry, not a poetry guy particularly,

1034
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,720
 but hey, I'm glad it's there.

1035
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,180
 Also not about my future.

1036
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,220
 Now I got some prophets, okay?

1037
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,420
 I've been reading a long time and now I got some prophets.

1038
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,660
 Seems like God's mad.

1039
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,540
 I'm probably a part of that,

1040
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,940
 but it's definitely not about my future.

1041
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,620
 There's nothing in here about me.

1042
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,620
 And then eventually you come to a place where you realize,

1043
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,560
 hey, this is a scene I've seen before.

1044
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,540
 I've looked at it a bunch of times,

1045
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,420
 but I hadn't seen it when this happened to me.

1046
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,420
 It's the scene where Jesus gives his blood,

1047
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,340
 his life on a cross.

1048
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,600
 Not a cross like the one, the shiny one

1049
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,580
 that you have around your neck,

1050
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,940
 but a cross where it's made of wood

1051
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,200
 and he's pinned to it like a poster.

1052
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,100
 And there's blood coming from every part of his body

1053
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,680
 so that you can't even recognize,

1054
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,780
 it says in the scripture,

1055
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,080
 can't even recognize that it's a human being.

1056
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,540
 Pain like you would not be able to even see

1057
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,440
 or even look at.

1058
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,040
 If you had been there, you would have passed out

1059
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,700
 or vomited or at least had to look away

1060
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,040
 'cause it was so gruesome.

1061
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,820
 And I'd been told about the cross of Christ

1062
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,920
 and I know it's on churches

1063
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,700
 and I know it's all over t-shirts

1064
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,920
 and I know it's a popular symbol,

1065
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,780
 but there was a time when I finally saw it.

1066
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:33,020
 And I saw that Jesus was spilling his blood,

1067
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,620
 expressing the love of God to me.

1068
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,220
 And you go, what does the blood of Christ

1069
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,760
 have to do with my future?

1070
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,660
 What does the blood of Christ have to do with me?

1071
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,820
 That was a sharp turn there, Garrett.

1072
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,580
 How'd you get from my future, my future

1073
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,020
 to the blood of Christ?

1074
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,500
 Well, Jesus explained the cross this way.

1075
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
 He said, I came to give my life as a ransom for many,

1076
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,620
 as a ransom to buy back many.

1077
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,760
 And you go, well, many what?

1078
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,720
 Many pasts?

1079
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,420
 Many divorces, abortions, angry seasons of your life,

1080
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,880
 came to buy back a past of bitterness,

1081
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,360
 came to ransom you from your lies and your secrets,

1082
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,400
 all the reasons you have in your head

1083
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,120
 to believe that God's not for you from this point forward.

1084
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,420
 Jesus came to pay for 'em.

1085
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,240
 So he came to buy back a past.

1086
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,920
 He came to buy back a present.

1087
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,300
 Your addiction, your secret, whatever you're harboring,

1088
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,180
 whatever it is in this place that makes you come in here

1089
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,920
 and be more interested in the opposite sex than in God,

1090
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,600
 whatever it is about you that's broken,

1091
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,720
 your self-obsession,

1092
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,000
 your inability to manage food or alcohol well,

1093
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,660
 he came to buy back your present.

1094
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,920
 And of course, by the blood of Christ,

1095
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,600
 he didn't just come back to buy the past and the present,

1096
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,500
 he came to buy back everyone's future.

1097
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,460
 Every step you take for the rest of your life,

1098
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,540
 Jesus died on the cross so that you could walk with him.

1099
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,760
 And you go, well, the cross is a thing of the past.

1100
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,360
 I mean, that was 2000 years ago.

1101
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,680
 What does that have to do with my future?

1102
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,680
 The cross is where your future was purchased back

1103
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,180
 and handed to you for free.

1104
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,320
 The Bible says that God can take back the years

1105
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,340
 that the enemy stole from you.

1106
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,520
 It says that God can take back

1107
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,320
 the years that the enemy ate from you.

1108
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,160
 The years you should have had

1109
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,900
 and the way life should have gone

1110
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,500
 doesn't have to be lost

1111
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,900
 because the blood of Christ came out

1112
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,340
 of a perfect human being,

1113
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,340
 the only perfect human being who has ever lived,

1114
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,780
 who gave everything he had for us.

1115
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,980
 Jesus said, "Greater love has no one than this."

1116
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,420
 Then he laid down his life for his friends.

1117
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,260
 Calls you a friend.

1118
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,920
 He also says, "I came that they may have life

1119
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,620
 "and have it abundant."

1120
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,400
 What's that mean?

1121
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,020
 Heaven for sure.

1122
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,440
 But what else does abundant life mean?

1123
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,580
 It means today for the rest of the rest,

1124
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,300
 you can walk with Christ because of the blood of Christ.

1125
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,700
 You can walk into the future that God wants for you.

1126
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,860
 Now, I wanna be really careful.

1127
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
 I'm not saying that if you believe in the blood of Christ

1128
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,820
 and become a Christian,

1129
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,920
 inside this magical chest of your future

1130
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,520
 is all the stuff you want.

1131
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,080
 I'm saying it's all the stuff God wants for you.

1132
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,020
 And you don't have to lose it this time.

1133
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,920
 Because Jesus died to bring it back to life.

1134
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,300
 That's our hope.

1135
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,320
 So I don't know what you're going through.

1136
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,700
 I don't know what disappointment you have.

1137
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,180
 I don't know what frustrations you have.

1138
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,180
 I don't know what insecurities you have.

1139
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,540
 And I'll be honest, I don't know when God's gonna unlock

1140
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,940
 all the stuff you wanna know and experience.

1141
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,020
 I haven't seen everything from God I want in my life.

1142
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
 I can tell you that.

1143
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,540
 And I don't know when you're gonna see it either.

1144
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,480
 But I know this, if you'll receive life from Christ,

1145
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,360
 you will receive everything God wants for you,

1146
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,320
 which is better than what you could dream up

1147
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,080
 on your best day.

1148
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,020
 I went out and ran toward the life I thought

1149
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,280
 I could build for myself.

1150
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,400
 And I came up empty.

1151
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,300
 And when I see the blood of Christ offering back to me

1152
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,280
 what I tried to throw away,

1153
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,260
 and letting me volunteer into it, not slapping my hand,

1154
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,040
 just saying I paid it.

1155
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,960
 The anger's gone.

1156
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,860
 Everything you did wrong is paid for.

1157
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,680
 And you can pick it up right here with hope

1158
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,380
 because of what Jesus did for you.

1159
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,440
 I don't know what God specifically wants to do through you.

1160
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
 I hope it's amazing.

1161
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,040
 I hope he gives you the wildest godly dreams in your heart.

1162
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,680
 I hope he uses you.

1163
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,680
 I hope he uses you to raise a family.

1164
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,720
 I hope he uses you to share his hope and love in your office

1165
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,520
 and actually see people respond.

1166
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,880
 I don't know what he wants to go do with you.

1167
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,760
 I just want you to be there and be available to find out.

1168
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,460
 And making the cross your everything today

1169
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,640
 is how you make sure you find out

1170
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,560
 what he wants to do with you.

1171
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,400
 It takes patience.

1172
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,800
 It's not instant.

1173
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,520
 And it's worth it.

1174
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
 Let's pray together.

1175
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:25,400
 God, we want everything to do with you.

1176
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,640
 We've tried our way.

1177
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,640
 We've moved out from your presence

1178
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,880
 and we've turned our back on you.

1179
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,360
 Every single one of us has tried to free ourself from you

1180
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,280
 only to end up tangled and realize it.

1181
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,520
 And God, there's more brokenness in this room

1182
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,800
 than I could ever name,

1183
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
 but because the shadow of the cross of Jesus Christ

1184
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
 is over this building tonight,

1185
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,520
 there is more hope in this room than I could ever say.

1186
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,760
 We thank you for the hope that we have, God.

1187
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,080
 Thank you for returning a hope to us.

1188
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,200
 Help us not let anxiety steal this moment away, God,

1189
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,480
 by making us worry, but yeah, what about, what about?

1190
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,200
 God, help us think just for a second.

1191
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,600
 Grab our attention for five minutes and help us think,

1192
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,680
 what about the cross and what does it mean for me?

1193
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,760
 Make eye contact with us, God,

1194
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,880
 so that we can see your love for us

1195
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,320
 and rejoice that we have a hope and a future here.

1196
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,240
 and a future, in Jesus' name, amen.
