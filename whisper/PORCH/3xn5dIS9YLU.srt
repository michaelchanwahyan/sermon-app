1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Father we come to you and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,860
 we're amazed that we in our brokenness and our

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,520
 unholiness in our human condition that we can

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,480
 Do what your scripture says which is to boldly come before the throne of grace that we might receive

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,960
 Grace and mercy to help us in a time of need and so Lord. We thank you that we can come

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,520
 And father we thank you that you're sovereign and

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,560
 Impressible and inconceivable in your love and I thank you Lord that we can just say to you that sometimes we don't see your love at work

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,100
 Sometimes we look at this world that you're sovereign over and we wonder what in the world you're doing

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,840
 And so I thank you Lord that we're not just left here to figure it out and speculate but we can open your word

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,320
 And you'll speak to us and you'll show us and you'll teach us things and you'll comfort us and you'll afflict us and you'll comfort us

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
 again

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,520
 So that we can know you the only God worth knowing

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,680
 Lord, I just pray for my friends tonight

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,060
 that are just really uncomfortable not being holy that they would just come to their senses and and those that are just

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,900
 Broken and scared in an unholy world with ungodly things happening

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,040
 That they could be comforted and they would see and understand

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,240
 Maybe in a way they never have and they could sing the songs that I just sang with them

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,880
 With a heart that knows who you are filled with grace at peace with the God who is holy

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,920
 Would you do all that tonight?

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,560
 Help us to serve you now in Jesus name

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,680
 Welcome it is a

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,840
 Tender night to be with my friends at the porch. I mean we are just hours on the backside of all of us once again just

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,600
 Experiencing numbness because of what's happening in this world and you all know that it's not just here in Dallas

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,080
 we've got 19 plus locations around the country that tune in with us and

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,120
 one of them are our friends in El Paso and

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,080
 So to my friends in El Paso that are watching. I want to let you know we have been praying for you

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,280
 We are praying for you. We know that we in Dallas

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,480
 Have a connection with you in the midst of this tragedy

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,200
 That a young man from our communities

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,760
 Made his way down to your town and brought terror and we we know that

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,640
 We have another connection with you and that is the God who's giving us comfort here and allowing us to intercede with you and for you

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 Is there with you as well?

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,200
 And so we love you guys and we're praying and we pray that tonight you would be comforted even as we're comforted that we could

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,240
 Comfort you with a comfort that we've been comforted. We have buried friends in this church who have died

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,920
 from mass shootings

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,880
 And so we love you

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,380
 It is a real privilege to to be with you you guys know

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,560
 my name is Todd and I get to hang out with you guys here at the porch periodically and hang out here a lot and

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
 Tonight we're just gonna talk a little bit about what in the world

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,640
 Is going on it. We're in the middle of a series called Jesus walks. I was gonna be with you tonight

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,360
 we're gonna talk about an amazing moment in history and

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,760
 One that I would have loved to have been at it was the transfiguration

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,880
 But there's another moment in history that I felt like we needed to deal with

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,520
 We start to think about

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,200
 Jesus walking 2,000 years ago. It's a it's a fair and appropriate question just to ask like hey

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,580
 What's a guy who lived and died 2,000 years ago got to do with me?

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,660
 It's a book that that has been put together and hobbled together and preserved. What's it got to do with me?

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,260
 I mean, come on Todd. Come on Christians. This is the real world we live in

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,560
 I mean, I like Jesus as much as I know about him, but what's he got to do with me?

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
 I mean, how can Jesus relate to my world? Well, do you know that?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,760
 Jesus lived during a day

52
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,440
 Where there was a random

53
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
 slaughter of innocents

54
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,900
 You know, Jesus was confronted with the question

55
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,800
 About people who were senselessly killed

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,660
 Anonymously as they were just going about in fact God's business. They weren't even shopping at Walmart. They weren't at school

57
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,320
 They were going about what they thought they would do in serving God

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,160
 Do you know that Jesus lived in a time where there was a mass murder?

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,140
 By what appeared to be random actors

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,040
 Killing people for no apparent reason and it's in your body

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,760
 Well, I'm gonna show it to you tonight and I think you're gonna find some truth here

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,160
 Jesus walked and the scripture says in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 15 that he walked on this earth

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,040
 What an amazing thing about God. This is this is one of the greatest sources of comfort me

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,160
 It says in Hebrews 4 15 that we have a high priest and we're talking about Jesus there. We have a high priest who can sympathize

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,520
 With our weakness with our frailty with our fear

66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,200
 Because he has been tempted in all things even as we have been tempted

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,320
 He's been tempted to go God. Where are you? Have you forsaken me? I mean, you know what you're doing. Are you asleep?

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 He walked as man

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,080
 He lived as men now. He did not commit sin. He was fully God and fully man

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,960
 He never stopped being God when he was here on earth, but he chose to lay aside his

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,400
 sovereign ability to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted and to walk as you and I walk and to trust as you and I

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
 Trust and because he trusted perfectly

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,920
 He was able to provide for us a means through which we can be reconciled to God and so it says in Hebrews 4 16 a

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,260
 Verse that I prayed before the rest of you jumped in with me

75
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,220
 It says therefore let us draw near because our high priest has made a sacrifice for us with his own body in his own blood

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,640
 That God demonstrated his love for us that while we're still sinners Christ came God came and died for us

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,100
 Therefore we can draw near now watch this with confidence to the throne of grace. I am a sinful man

78
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,000
 But I can move

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,360
 boldly before a holy God that I can receive mercy and grace to help me in a time of need and

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,220
 Jesus lived in a day when there was a random senseless murder

81
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,600
 Mass murder

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,620
 That's a little Bible trivia, I'm pausing right here for a second anybody have any idea where I'm gonna turn

83
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,400
 Yeah, I heard somebody screaming up top that's it we're gonna go there Luke 13 and mum before we get there let me just do this

84
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
 I

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,520
 Just want to just spend some time just reminding ourself of some things that are true

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 And

87
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,000
 Let's just read some scripture together and let's just comfort ourselves the the scripture says and in Psalm 34 that God is

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,400
 He draws near to the brokenhearted. He saves those that are crushed in spirit now listen

89
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,720
 There's gonna be application for all of us tonight

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,360
 Okay, first of all you need to know this God will draw near to you as you are brokenhearted not because

91
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,960
 Circumstances around you seem scary overwhelming and out of control

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,940
 But he draws near to you when you're brokenhearted over the out-of-control

93
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,120
 Scary sin that reigns in the hearts of everybody who doesn't know him

94
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,720
 So just mark my word this verse has dual application

95
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,940
 It has application towards those of us who are grieving the loss of friends and loved ones in our community

96
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:46,260
 But it's a verse that primarily and really also applies to those that have a broken and contrite spirit and then just go God

97
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,660
 I mean you're holy and I don't know if I if I can have a relationship with you

98
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,540
 And I'm I want to because you're the only thing that can bring me comfort in times like this

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,220
 He saves those who are crushed in spirit

100
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,660
 Now verse 19 is what really applies to us

101
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,540
 Many are the afflictions of the righteous we we're here

102
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,480
 And we're afflicted because we live in a world that is not the world that God intended

103
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,600
 We live in a world that is infused with sin we live in a world that is inhabited by men

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,280
 That aren't just sinners in their nature

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,120
 But that remains sin in their nature and all of us were born into sin some of us by the kindness of God have come

106
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,400
 To know the goodness of his way, and we begin now to walk with him instead of being darkness

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,960
 We're light instead of being the source of decay. We're actually a source of

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,080
 Preservation we're salt

109
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,740
 But we still live in a world that brings affliction to us

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,380
 None of us are without sin all of us in some way contribute to sadness at some level every day

111
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,580
 But certainly when we come to know Christ is the transformation that happens and God changes our hearts

112
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,260
 And we become a source of hope and not a source of destruction

113
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,780
 And and and the Lord will deliver us though that says in verse 19 out of all the affliction that we have one day

114
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,280
 Let me just share with you a few verses that Jesus said to his disciples when he was getting ready to leave

115
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,920
 Okay in John chapter 14 in verse 27. He says that peace I leave with you now look

116
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,520
 It doesn't look like a very peaceful world does it?

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,440
 But Jesus says peace I leave with you my my peace God says I give to you

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,360
 It's not the peace that the world's gonna give to you

119
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,520
 But it's gonna be a different kind you're gonna find he says don't let your heart be troubled don't let it be fearful

120
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,880
 What God's gonna offer us is something it's it's a understanding of the sovereign

121
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,340
 Eternity sweeping kindness and goodness of God, but he's gonna let you know that in this world

122
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,560
 We're not there yet

123
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
 So don't be surprised in John 16 in the same little message when he's talking to his troops when he's talking to his team

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
 And he says we're gonna go through this thing together

125
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,560
 He said I'm speaking all these things to you and he and you got to go read John 14 15 and 16

126
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,460
 He says these things I've spoken to you such you might have peace so that when you have

127
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,920
 Tribulation you won't lose heart you won't become uncourageous you won't wilt you won't

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,640
 Go into the fetal position because you'll know that God's overcome the world and God has overcome the world

129
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,600
 But the world that we're living right now has not yet met and understood and lived underneath

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
 The kindness and goodness of God and when we don't live underneath the kindness and goodness of God

131
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,840
 We've got all kinds of problems

132
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
 I say all the time when we as humans leave and

133
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,720
 Don't have faith in and trust in the God who is goodness and kindness and light and life and love you're going to get

134
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,700
 What you have when you leave that which is darkness and hatred and death

135
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,560
 and not love but murder and

136
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,860
 Jesus says look I love you, but some of you guys are gonna be reconciled to me

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,520
 and I'm gonna leave you in this murderous world and

138
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,920
 I want you to offer hope and grace and repentance and I want you to show strength in the midst of loss and

139
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,400
 I want you to grieve but not as those who grieve without hope

140
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,120
 So don't be surprised this is earth

141
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,880
 And just like God when he came to earth he suffered because the world doesn't receive him

142
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,720
 When we start to understand who God is we're not confused by these kind of events

143
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,280
 But God says let's go church rise up wake up. I want to use you

144
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,920
 to stem the madness

145
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,560
 To bring hope and to comfort those who are afflicted and don't understand what you're gonna understand if you hang in there with me tonight

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,220
 Let's just remind ourself of this truth as we get ready to look at how Jesus handled a mass

147
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,520
 Murder and a random act of killing during his day and age

148
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,920
 Psalm 46 though says this God is our refuge

149
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,620
 And I have nothing to offer you tonight apart from my God

150
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,680
 But because he is my refuge and he is my strength I can stand before you and I can help you

151
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,480
 Not because I'm older than you or wiser than you but because the God who created you has given me and you a revelation

152
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,160
 He's pulled back the veil and he said quit speculating on philosophers quit saying you love wisdom

153
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,840
 Listen to the God who is wisdom who loves you who is preserved for you truth. Let him be your strength

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,480
 Scripture says therefore we will not fear though. The earth should change and man. It's a changing is it not

155
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:38,120
 Though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea though its waters roar and foam though the mountains quake as swelling pride the

156
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,440
 Walmart's become

157
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,520
 Rippled with blood

158
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,920
 Know this there's another river whose streams make glad the City of God

159
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,560
 The holy dwelling place of the Most High God is in the midst of her she will not be moved

160
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,000
 God will help her when morning dawns the nations will make an uproar the kingdoms will totter

161
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,320
 God will raise his voice one day and the earth will melt the Lord of hosts is with us

162
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,880
 The God of Jacob is our stronghold come behold the works of the Lord

163
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,440
 Who has wrought desolations in the earth he makes wars to cease to the end of the earth

164
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,940
 He breaks the bow. He cuts the spear in two. He burns the cherries with fire. There is no evil that will

165
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:28,720
 move on earth that God is not sovereign over cease trying to fix it by your gun control laws and by your

166
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,200
 Philosophies and politics there's one way to fix it

167
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,800
 This is a problem of the human heart I

168
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:48,360
 Have been in a land where there was not a wide distribution of guns it was called Rwanda and

169
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,800
 Just over two decades ago about a million Rwandans died the problem wasn't a broad distribution of guns

170
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,320
 The problem was darkness had grown in their heart

171
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,320
 This is the battle not against flesh and blood and not against

172
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
 Manufacturers this is a battle

173
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,520
 Against the human condition apart from God

174
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,840
 over a million Rwandans were killed hand to hand with with

175
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 machetes and

176
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,000
 rocks and sticks in a hundred days a

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,960
 million

178
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,000
 See striving to try and figure out how to fix this

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,040
 God alone will be exalted among nations and I'm going to show you a little bit tonight

180
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,320
 About how Jesus handled questions that you might have been asked right now, but what in the world is going on?

181
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,360
 But be sure the Lord of hosts is with us the God of Jacob is

182
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,640
 Our stronghold it's called the God of Jacob because you can read the story of Jacob who is a deceiver

183
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,960
 Who tried to live life apart from God?

184
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,720
 But God was determined to show him kindness and eventually

185
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,160
 Jacob was wounded to the point where he walked with a limp and then God restored him back into relationship with him and God used

186
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,120
 That that pain to show him who he was in the midst of that Jacob then turned to God and trusted in him and God

187
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,920
 Was able to allow him to prosper in the midst of that relationship

188
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,680
 Not materially as much as with the strength of a heart that can be informed by the truth of who God is

189
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:29,600
 He's a God with a resume he's a God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob go look at the way God treats murderers and liars and

190
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,320
 deceivers

191
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,280
 And have hope that maybe he can treat you the same way

192
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,080
 If you got a Bible and I hope you do open it to Luke chapter 13

193
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,480
 Luke 13

194
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,000
 There there's an occasion that is going on here and what Jesus is basically saying is hey look around you

195
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,560
 Take note of what's happening and and make good decisions. He in fact uses

196
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,640
 Simple truths about

197
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,980
 Designs of nature and things that we see happen in nature with weather right you you haven't been

198
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,720
 Alive very long before you hear little things that will help you understand like red at night sailors to life

199
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,000
 But red in the morning sailors take warning right you ever heard that in other words

200
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,920
 You can tell a little bit about what's coming on the horizon

201
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,680
 or in the rest of the day by looking out just a little bit ahead and

202
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,120
 Lifting your head up and and reading the signs of the times and what Jesus is saying that if you mistake the signs of the

203
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,280
 Times you're gonna have troubled seas and you're not gonna be prepared for it

204
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,960
 And so he says just before this little occasion

205
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,440
 He says I just want to warn you you guys are smart enough to know that if you're gonna go to a

206
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,640
 Magistrate or go to a court and you think you might get prosecuted that you do everything you can to kind of cut a deal

207
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,800
 You do everything you can to

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,580
 Plea bargain so that you won't execute a certain level of judgment and in effect in the context right before we're here

209
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,740
 What Jesus is saying is listen people you'll do whatever is necessary to stay out of jail

210
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:07,140
 You might want to pay a little bit of attention and apply the same intentionality to stay out of hell

211
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:14,880
 Because there is a sovereign judge who's greater than your human magistrates and

212
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,920
 If you just watch what's going on, you'll see that he's here. That's Luke 12

213
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,400
 and

214
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
 There's a day he's gonna come and you don't know when that day is

215
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,940
 But avail yourself to the truth that's being revealed and I say the same thing to you tonight avail yourself to this truth

216
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,740
 So Luke 13 now on the same occasion

217
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,460
 In other words during this little

218
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:45,260
 Dialogue that he's having it says on the same occasion there there were some present with him who reported to him about the Galileans

219
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,840
 Whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. Okay, so let me explain this to you

220
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,260
 There were some folks that were listening to Jesus and they were frankly probably enemies of Christ

221
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,940
 there were people that were trying to create problems for Jesus and they knew if they confronted him with some

222
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,180
 Things that were happening in that day one of two things were gonna happen

223
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,200
 He was either look like he was pro-oppressor. The Romans had occupied Israel and they were

224
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:17,540
 Causing the Israelites to live in a time of great despair that despair it was highlighted recently by an attack that happened when Pilate's

225
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:23,460
 Had mingled some Galileans blood with their sacrifices. All right, here's a little historical knowledge for you

226
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,540
 We know from history that at some point that what Pilate did because he was building some aqueducts. What's an aqueduct?

227
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
 We don't have aqueducts around here. That's right

228
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,900
 We put pipes in the ground an aqueduct is a way to carry water

229
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,020
 from one part of a land where there's plenty of it to another part of a land where there isn't one and

230
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,300
 Pilate needed some funding for that. So he dipped into the temple treasury

231
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:50,140
 People brought if you will their ties and offerings to worship God and Pilate said hey as the bully on the block

232
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,220
 I'm gonna say we're not gonna get new pews or new carpet. We're not going to get you know new instruments

233
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,300
 We're not gonna get new buildings. We're gonna build an aqueduct for the Romans

234
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,100
 That are garrisoned here

235
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,660
 making sure you're oppressed and

236
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,740
 What had happened is

237
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,300
 When the Jews heard about this they gathered together to protest and when Pilate saw the protests

238
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,260
 He sent some of his soldiers dressed in plain clothes

239
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,940
 Amongst those particular people from Galilee who were protesting what he had done and they started to randomly murder a number of Jews in

240
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,500
 The midst of their shouting and saying pilots gotta go. Let's get rid of Rome

241
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,020
 They couldn't hear the screams of a number of them that were being shivved

242
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:42,660
 And so at the temple where they offer the blood of sacrifices many Jews had died

243
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,380
 And so one of two things was gonna happen here based on how Jesus

244
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,420
 Responded this moment. It was either gonna allow the Jews to accuse him of being pro-roman

245
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,740
 Or he was gonna defend the Jews and say what Pilate did was wrong

246
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,060
 And they knew that that would make the Roman leaders go we got to get rid of this Jesus because he can decide a riot

247
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:06,380
 So Jesus is caught between a rock and a hard place here. First of all, he says he's God

248
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,420
 He says God is love God. Just let this crazy thing happen. And now what's he gonna do?

249
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,260
 Is he gonna be pro-roman or pro-jew? Now? I love what Jesus did because he answers typically with a question. That's what he does

250
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,940
 Right. They were kind of saying hey, what do you make of this? And

251
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,520
 You know, it's kind of like you if you watch Jesus, he's just a master

252
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,700
 It's like a guy one time, you know, he said to me. Hey when I ask you a question, why do you always

253
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,060
 Reply by asking me another one and I said to that guy go. Why do you ask?

254
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,700
 It's kind of what Jesus did

255
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,420
 He said let me ask you a question before I give an answer and here comes this question

256
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,460
 He answered and said to them. Do you suppose or I got a question for you?

257
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,020
 Do you suppose that these Galileans now watch this the ones that died in this random?

258
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,940
 Tragedy were greater sinners than all

259
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,960
 The other Galileans because those that died suffered this fate

260
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,820
 So they were trying to make sense out of this and and and one of the things that happens sometimes in the midst of tragedy is

261
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:16,980
 People think well if evil has befallen you there must be some reason to befell you like it didn't befall me for that reason and

262
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,940
 What Jesus is gonna do is not answer their question

263
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,220
 But he's gonna keep the conversation he was in with them going

264
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:33,180
 Now listen, I have not heard anybody I haven't heard anybody say about the Walmart incident

265
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,660
 What I heard them sometimes say about the pulse incident. You remember the pulse incident?

266
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,220
 In Orlando

267
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,020
 40 some-odd people were killed just a few years ago. Do you remember that mass shooting?

268
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,020
 Do you remember what kind of bar?

269
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,580
 Went down without shooting was what was it? It was a gay bar

270
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:59,300
 And I heard some people say well, there you go, it's God's judgment

271
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,420
 You're gonna see that that just won't stand I

272
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,460
 Haven't heard anybody say well you should shop at Walmart. There you go

273
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,940
 How crazy is that?

274
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,060
 Listen to me

275
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,580
 He says you really suppose that could be you're out

276
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,260
 You suppose the Galileans were greater sinners and all the other ones because they suffered this faith because their bloods were were mingled

277
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,500
 No, I tell you watch verse 3. I tell you unless you repent you will also

278
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 likewise perish

279
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,260
 What's he talking about

280
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,660
 Let me just read a couple more verses because he's not done he goes let's just add something else

281
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,100
 All right

282
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,700
 Do you suppose that those?

283
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,760
 18 on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse culprits than all the men who live in Jerusalem because there were some

284
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,740
 People that were building a tower, right? That's what you did

285
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,740
 He built places for outlooks and and watchdogs to be and and they'd be up there

286
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,840
 They were building a tower for use in the city and in the midst of that construction as often happens in construction

287
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
 especially ancient construction

288
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,180
 the walls fell and

289
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,820
 18 people were killed he goes do you think those 18 people died because they were the most wicked 18 people in Siloam?

290
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
 Is that why they died?

291
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,860
 Watch what Jesus says about this. He says I say to you no

292
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,860
 But unless you repent you will all likewise perish

293
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,500
 Let me just say a few things I think that are obvious to this crowd but

294
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,120
 Start with this human tragedies not always divine punishments, right?

295
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,680
 Human tragedies are not always divine punishments

296
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
 You know

297
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 You don't get out of human tragedies

298
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,940
 because of your faith if you have a tragedy of cancer if you have the tragedy of some birth defect if you have the the

299
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,200
 tragedy of of

300
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,900
 Great sorrow in your life that was thrown upon you. It's not always

301
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,080
 because of

302
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,120
 What you have done. Otherwise, how do you explain all the suffering of the prophets? How do you explain the crucifixion of Jesus Christ?

303
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,520
 How do you explain

304
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,640
 the Parkinson of Billy Graham no

305
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,200
 Tragedy is not always a result of divine punishment

306
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,040
 But I will tell you that things that happen in this world that are not heavenly that are not

307
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,320
 Kingdom things happen because we live in a world that is not yet his kingdom

308
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 Now

309
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,000
 A number of God's kingdom people are here. Well Todd, who are they?

310
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Those are folks who are brokenhearted and contrite about their own sin

311
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,840
 They have what's called godly sorrow they're not filled with worldly sorrow like what are we gonna do look at all that's going on around us

312
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,160
 It's not right. How can we stop this from happening? And God says well, here's how you can stop it from happening

313
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,880
 Let my kingdom come

314
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,120
 On earth is this in heaven because there's been those mass shootings in heaven. There's been no lack of peace in heaven

315
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,680
 There is no paralyzing diseases in heaven. There is no birth defect in heaven

316
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,600
 There is no tear in heaven

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:15,040
 But I just want to say this this is so amazing heaven has shed tears on earth

318
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:22,320
 Before I unpack this for you right here. I just want to tell you this is what Jesus would do if he was in

319
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 El Paso right now. It's what we're doing right now

320
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,640
 He would weep with those who weep he would mourn with those who mourn when Jesus moved where sin had reigned if you will in

321
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,120
 The life of his friend Lazarus and Mary and Martha Jesus

322
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,760
 Wept when Jesus looked at the chaos and the dead religion that ruled his day

323
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:48,760
 He spoke over Jerusalem and he wept and he said Oh Jerusalem Jerusalem. Oh, Dallas Dallas. Oh El Paso Oh Joplin Oh

324
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,200
 Houston

325
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,620
 How I long for you to know me

326
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,640
 and

327
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,280
 For you to be a source of my grace and kindness and hope and redemption

328
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,720
 In the world that you live in I can make provision for all of your sin

329
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,960
 Don't look at the sin of mass murderers and terrorists

330
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,680
 Deal with the brokenness in your own life. Don't be surprised when there's chaos and trouble among you

331
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,360
 There's always going to be Jesus said to his disciples the poor are always going to be with you

332
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,680
 Racists are always going to be with us

333
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,440
 Idiot white supremacists will always be with us

334
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:39,920
 And Jesus says just don't be one of them

335
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:49,880
 Do what you can to help the poor and do what you can do to help people those poor people that are trapped in the

336
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,200
 Lostness of their clouded eye and broken worldview

337
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,920
 Be a source of the grace

338
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:06,600
 And he says just repent repentance is a word that we have a hard time with but repentance always

339
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,840
 Starts with knowledge of sin. You see what Jesus did right here

340
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,400
 Hey, you guys want me to throw pilot under the bus and pilots gonna get thrown under the bus mark my word

341
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,520
 But he just says this you better repent or you will likewise perish that those that died

342
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,800
 Under pilots hand and he says you better repent or you will die

343
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,120
 Like those who were just going to work and died while they were at work. And so what's it mean?

344
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
 You two will likewise perish

345
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,440
 When the people that he's talking about were randomly killed in the Walmarts of his day

346
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,200
 Or we're just going to work to provide for their families and they died. Here's the answer

347
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,720
 If you don't deal with your sin, which separates you from God

348
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,840
 If you don't deal with your sin that separates you from God you will likewise perish like those individuals number one

349
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,280
 You will die in judgment under judgment from one who is in authority now pilot was abusive in his authority and was abusive in his

350
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,240
 Judgment, but Jesus just got through telling a story like look there is a judge and he is coming and he will recompense men

351
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,360
 According to his deeds and it's gonna happen suddenly and you better be ready

352
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,680
 Because you will meet a judge and he's a righteous judge and the way you think you get, you know

353
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,280
 Reconciled to me through your own works or your dead religion. You're wrong

354
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,040
 you get reconciled to me by being brokenhearted and

355
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,080
 crushed in spirit

356
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,600
 Blessed are the poor in spirit

357
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,400
 Let me ask you a question this week when you've been looking at the ravages of sin in your world

358
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,280
 Have you looked in a mirror and see the sins ravaged your own life?

359
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:49,880
 You know when people say like then why doesn't God stop this stuff you guys know I do something called real truth real quick

360
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,140
 I did a real truth real quick a while ago called

361
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,440
 Why doesn't God stop terrorism and mass shootings and one of the things I said the night I did it right after the Pulse murders

362
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 Which was the largest mass murder?

363
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,560
 In American history at the time and one of the things I just said is let me ask you a question

364
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,240
 How many people outside of that nightclub in America that night? Do you think we're we're looking at porn?

365
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,820
 How many people in the room that were here right now we're sleeping with somebody that night

366
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:21,680
 How many of us had arrogant ideas about our own self-righteousness

367
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,360
 Or had some sense of superiority over others because guys that's evil

368
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,360
 and when we talk about what God should judge most of us think about evil and we define evil as

369
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,560
 Anything that doesn't please us. That's not the way God defines evil the guy named Alexander Solzhenitsyn who lived underneath

370
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,880
 Stalin's oppressive

371
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,480
 Murderous regime killed killed millions of people in Russia. He had put in the Gulag archipelago

372
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,520
 Which is in the northern part of Siberia and while he was there

373
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,480
 He wrote an amazing work and one of the things he said is this if only there were evil people somewhere

374
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,680
 Insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy those evil people

375
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,920
 What he wasn't saying there is hey, there's really no evil people. What he's saying is if only

376
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,640
 Evil was in them

377
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,480
 And

378
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,160
 While Solzhenitsyn may not have been part of a murderous communist

379
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,560
 worldview and power structure he knew

380
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,960
 That that same sin which led Stalin to do what he did was in him

381
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
 And

382
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,160
 He repented

383
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:46,080
 He took Jesus's message and he said just for a second he says I'm gonna meet a righteous judge one day

384
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
 and

385
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
 I want to be ready

386
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
 What does Jesus mean when he says if you don't repent you will likewise perish

387
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,460
 He means you're gonna die in judgment one day under somebody who has authority over you secondly

388
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,700
 He meant you're going to die someday probably most of us without time to prepare for our death

389
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,220
 Death doesn't usually call you and say hey

390
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,480
 next week

391
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,200
 It's a guy who's gonna just kind of cross that dotted line

392
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,840
 And he's gonna clip your car and you're going home death doesn't usually come

393
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,040
 with hours in a hospital bed

394
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,940
 It's why it's a really bad idea for this room to go I'm 20 death isn't gonna come to me have you read

395
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,340
 The biographies of those who have been dying

396
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,060
 It's your generation

397
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,040
 And I'm not just trying to scare you I'm just trying to tell you Jesus says listen, man

398
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 You guys got to be you got to be ready

399
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,900
 Because you don't know when this is gonna happen

400
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,140
 When Jesus says if you don't repent you'd likewise

401
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,780
 Will perish what he's saying is two things you're gonna die in judgment from somebody under authority

402
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,480
 Which is him and secondly you're gonna die without time to prepare yourself James 4 13 through 16 come now

403
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
 You who say today or tomorrow?

404
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,260
 We shall go to such-and-such a city and spend a year

405
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,900
 There and engage in business and make a profit yet. You do not know what your life will be like tomorrow

406
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,520
 You're just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away

407
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,020
 You just go to Walmart because it's tax-free weekend

408
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,780
 You go grocery shopping for your mom. Have you read the stories?

409
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:34,880
 Instead you ought to see if the Lord wills we shall live and do this or that but as it is your boast and

410
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
 Your arrogance all your boasting is evil

411
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,940
 Repentance always starts with the knowledge of sin

412
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,660
 It always goes on to create a sorrow for sin not for circumstances

413
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,980
 Can I just say this to you guys it you're not repenting if you're not aware of your own sin

414
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,680
 You're not repenting if you don't have deep heartfelt broken-hearted sorrow for your sin

415
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:06,020
 It always leads to confession of God of you being nothing like him. It always shows itself before men

416
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,300
 by a growing breaking of

417
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,620
 kinship with sin

418
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,220
 Repentance changes playmates and it changes playgrounds

419
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
 repentance

420
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,160
 Is not just you change your idea that

421
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,760
 Jesus's story is true and you used to think it was false

422
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,140
 Repentance always produces a result. I will show that to you here before the day is over

423
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,640
 Let me just give you a couple of more

424
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,060
 Applications won't we've just read before I show you that final that final point and that is just simply this what I'm doing right here

425
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,420
 Guy I'm just trying to help you in the midst of what's going on to let you know

426
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,220
 What's going on?

427
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,540
 And in a very sad very difficult way, I would tell you that times of suffering are sometimes

428
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,660
 Sovereignly allowed by God to bring truth to light

429
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:00,660
 Times of suffering are sometimes allowed by God to bring truth to light and man

430
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,140
 There's been some truth that's been brought to light hasn't there been like man something's wrong

431
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,980
 life can end suddenly

432
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,380
 And I'm gonna ask you are you going to deal with those realities?

433
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,900
 and

434
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
 What's gonna be your solution?

435
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:23,220
 I'm gonna tell you cease striving man, and you better know that he is God

436
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,420
 Guy named CS Lewis if you hang around circles like this

437
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,820
 You're gonna hear his name quoted because he thought a lot he used to not believe in God for a long time

438
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,900
 And then he came to a place where he was had knowledge of his own sin

439
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,300
 He said this we can we can ignore God even in our pleasure

440
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,620
 But pain pain is different pain insists upon being attended to

441
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,500
 Right you guys had that

442
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,700
 The pain of not being ready for a test

443
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:58,700
 The pain of being fired from a job the pain of loving somebody and not having it reciprocated

444
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:05,300
 The pain of having your mom and dad not love each other anymore the pain of growing up under a godless generation ahead of you

445
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
 the pain of being in a world that is

446
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,340
 Just

447
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,020
 Devolving into math greater and greater chaos the pain of a mass murderer in your town

448
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:24,740
 But pain insists upon being attended to God whispers to us in our pleasures I

449
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,620
 Mean one of the things that pleasures are is is a little hint of heaven

450
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,420
 And God wants you to know he's a good and kind and gracious God

451
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,740
 He created you to to enjoy him and and there is a shadow of the goodness that's all around us

452
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,620
 He speaks in our consciousness. He he does that but he shouts in our pain

453
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,660
 it is his megaphone to raise and

454
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,940
 rouse the deaf world and

455
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,820
 You would do well to pay attention

456
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:59,380
 This is not to say that evil is good evil is not good

457
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,020
 But we can make sense of evil events

458
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:10,820
 These these evil things are senseless acts sin never makes sense

459
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,340
 It takes you

460
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,680
 Farther than you want to go it keeps you longer than you want to stay and it costs you more than you want to pay

461
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,580
 You know, they're talking to this kid that that went to Plano High School right here in our town members of our church

462
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,580
 went to school with this kid and

463
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,300
 Maybe they loved him. Maybe they invited him to come hang out with us

464
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,500
 He's your peer right here in

465
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,420
 Your area you could have met him if you were an Allen you could have loved him

466
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,260
 You could have seen his loneliness. You could have said hey, there's this thing called the porch

467
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,420
 It's this church called watermark

468
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,740
 There's this church where you're going to where disciples are made and you could have loved him

469
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,620
 You could have reached out to him. You could have been a source of healing in his heart

470
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,120
 You could have been he might have suppressed it. He might have rejected it

471
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,540
 He might have been committed to his sin, but this is a kid that was hurting this kid

472
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,420
 They say they can't even interview yet. He's still in shock. He doesn't even know what he did

473
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,740
 Evil does that to you you ever felt like that? Who am I?

474
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:13,740
 Well, if you don't know Jesus and you haven't got to that place yet you haven't repented and you just wait

475
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,780
 Because it gets ugly

476
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:25,820
 And Jesus is saying come here man, I can explain the evil that happened in that kid's heart

477
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,060
 Can you deal with the evil that's in yours? I'm the source of your evil times of suffering are

478
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,660
 Sovereign allowed by God to bring truth to light. I

479
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:39,780
 Had just want to stick this in there because some people might say Todd where was God where was God when this happened?

480
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,500
 And I would just say he was identifying with us in our suffering

481
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,260
 He has suffered he said my god my god, why have you forsaken me he is he is interceding for us in the heavens

482
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,880
 That's where he is. He's before the father and I got to believe I just gotta tell you I'll stick this in right here

483
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,260
 One of my favorite places in Scripture

484
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,680
 I love it when Jesus just kind of pulls back the veil like pilot is, you know having the crap beat out of him

485
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,060
 He's mingling Jesus's blood right and he just says hey man

486
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,200
 Don't you know who I am and Jesus just grabs him by the throat and he brings him down

487
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,100
 I this is this is a little extra biblical, but I think it happened. I

488
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:18,100
 Mean he's beaten. He's whipped. He's tortured and pilot knows. He's not guilty and passes man speak up

489
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,240
 Who are you and what are you doing? Don't you know who I am and Jesus?

490
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,780
 I know exactly who you are

491
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,260
 The question is do you know who I am if you knew who I was you would go out there and tell him you're not

492
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,500
 Have anything to do with my crucifixion, but you're a coward. You don't love God. You love you. So you're gonna appease the people

493
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,140
 You're not

494
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,420
 Going to have a good tomorrow

495
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,620
 Let's him go I

496
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,840
 Had other words in my head that's why I stuttered there

497
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,660
 Jesus wouldn't have said what I was thinking I would have said in that moment

498
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,660
 I

499
00:38:52,660 --> 00:39:01,580
 And there's another time, you know, Jesus is crucified he's resurrected

500
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,560
 He reveals himself to the world and he's ascended

501
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,740
 He's sitting at the right hand of God and then and then one of his boys Stephen Stephen

502
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,120
 Who loves God?

503
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,440
 Testifies unlike pilot was willing to face a mob of Jews Stephen did he just said let me just tell you who Jesus was you?

504
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,620
 Crucified him you killed him. He was God's provision

505
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:26,820
 He's the Messiah and they stoned Stephen to death and it says he looked up into the heavens and he saw Jesus

506
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,020
 What was Jesus doing?

507
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
 Wouldn't work in a rosary

508
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,460
 Wasn't praying to Mary

509
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,740
 He wasn't interceding before the father

510
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:41,060
 Anybody remember what Jesus was doing he was standing

511
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,580
 Again now here's my little extra biblical

512
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,780
 Moment, right? So I'm a child of the 70s 60s and and whatnot

513
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,140
 And so, you know, you ever watch the Flintstones, right?

514
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,020
 I think a little nod right whenever Barney and Fred would get ready to run. What would they always do?

515
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,020
 The little legs would do that then make that little sound right? I got to believe and this is again not your Bible

516
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,580
 It's just in mind

517
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,060
 Okay

518
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,080
 And I believe Jesus saw what was going on that he saw his children

519
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,460
 Suffering in that world that he knew was gonna be wracked with trouble. He saw one of his sheep being tortured by sinful men

520
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,260
 I think he said done interceding. Let's go. Let's roll back the clouds like a scroll. Let's go get him right now dad

521
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,780
 And I think he said a little like that and the father

522
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,340
 Like not yet son. Not yet

523
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,780
 Not yet

524
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,040
 But your Jesus knows all about your Walmart man

525
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,700
 He knows all about your parents. He knows all about

526
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,940
 All the hard ship that's happened to you

527
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:42,900
 He knows about the hardness of your own heart and he loves you and the scripture says in 2nd Peter chapter 3

528
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,700
 It says that God is not slow as some count slowness

529
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,500
 But he's patient towards you wishing that none should perish but that all should come to eternal life

530
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:00,660
 So what's another application here it is judgment is certain you just need to know judgment is certain Jesus said as much

531
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,060
 Right, you're gonna likewise perish under a sovereign over you who will judge in as much

532
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:11,020
 It's appointed the scripture says for men in Hebrews 9 27 for men to die once and after this comes judgment. I

533
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,340
 Just tell people all the time, you know

534
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:22,980
 What's the death rate in your city the answer is one a piece that's the death rate everybody that is born

535
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,460
 Dies people are dying every day who have never died before

536
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,160
 And the scripture says that God is patient towards you

537
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,300
 But you need to know this there's going to be a place at a time where if you've not yet started

538
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,740
 Praying it won't matter if you do. Can I just say that to you again?

539
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:54,540
 There's going to be a time and a place where if you haven't already been praying and I'm not talking about when you hear pop

540
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,920
 Pop pop pop pop in your school in your church in your Walmart that he won't deliver you

541
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,980
 I'm talking about there is a time when when the in the flood this is we'll just I'll give it to you Psalm 32 6

542
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,980
 It says therefore let everyone who is godly pray to him in a time when he may be found

543
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,220
 Because surely in a flood of great waters

544
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,580
 You will not reach him

545
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:25,620
 There is often a second chance

546
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,860
 But there is always a last chance people God has offered

547
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,740
 Forgiveness to your repentance. He has not promised tomorrow to your procrastination

548
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,280
 He just hasn't

549
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,300
 And unless you to repent man, you know

550
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,320
 You might just go to work faithfully tomorrow and the tower may fall on you. You're gonna die just like them in Siloam

551
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,740
 Quickly without a chance to deal with your sin

552
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,180
 So don't just live it up in your 20s. Don't give your 20s to the devil

553
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,220
 Don't just say I'm gonna get after it then later

554
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,860
 I'm gonna find a good girl and we're gonna settle down and then I'll start to go to church. That's a bad plan

555
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:09,820
 That might have been the plan of our brother in Plano who drove 10 hours to El Paso

556
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,980
 Sin will take you farther than you want to go

557
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,500
 it'll keep you longer than you want to stay and it'll cost you more than you want to pay and

558
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,820
 Sometimes man, there ain't no getting out and you just don't even know where it came from

559
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
 Jesus

560
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:35,340
 Closes this little story in Luke 13 by saying this

561
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,820
 It's interesting as a shift here

562
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,300
 in verse 6

563
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,300
 he says he began telling this parable a

564
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,620
 Certain man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard. He came looking for fruit on it

565
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,620
 He did not he didn't find any fruit

566
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,820
 and he said to the vinekeeper behold for three years, I've come looking for fruit in this big tree three years and

567
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,540
 Without finding any cut it down

568
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,620
 Why does it even use up this ground and and the vine keeper said to him?

569
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,420
 Let it alone sir

570
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,340
 Just just for this year too until I dig around it and put fertilizer in it and and if it bears fruit next year fine

571
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,780
 Let me encourage it

572
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,940
 Let me let me give it nourishment. Let me give it a couple of more porches

573
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,220
 But

574
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,740
 If not cut it down

575
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,740
 I mean one of the things that I just see when I when I look at this is

576
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,580
 Is that first of all what Jesus does is he ties?

577
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,300
 The fruitfulness of the fig tree to a story about repentance and I want you to hear this

578
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,900
 I think you heard me said already repentance guys is not just a change of mind

579
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,780
 It's a change of mind that always results in a change of accent. That's why this story is here

580
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,260
 Some of you at the porch have embraced the idea of Jesus

581
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,580
 You might even have shed a little tear one night when you've been especially moved about your sin and God's

582
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,460
 Kindness towards you you've got knowledge of sin. You've got sorrow for sin

583
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,220
 You've got confession of sin before God

584
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:06,080
 But this story is here for you because in addition to your confession of sin before God there

585
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,420
 There's got to be and there will be if you have a relationship with God and breaking off from sin not

586
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,380
 Perfectly we're not perfect

587
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,940
 But but God if he has not changed your appetites if you can still sin with the same ease if you can say well

588
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,740
 This is just the sin that God gave me and I don't need to deal with it. I don't need to change it

589
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,740
 I'm telling you that's a problem

590
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:36,180
 And you might be planted in this little vineyard right here and think that you're doing fine, but there's no fruit on it

591
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:45,340
 There will be a cutting down if you have not in your life have an increasing production of a habit of deep

592
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,420
 hatred for all sin

593
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,580
 First of all, what are you looking forward to in heaven?

594
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:56,900
 People who have a love for sin will not look forward to heaven

595
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:04,300
 Look forward to being with God. No, they will shrink back at his coming the same way a

596
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,940
 Dead tree is sucking nutrients out of a ground where God expects there to be produce

597
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:19,060
 What you see here and just a little application is just this and that is if our roots are buried deep in the soil of

598
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:24,160
 God's Word then God's fruit should and where and will bear evidence in our life

599
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,500
 Let me just say this you are not saved because of these works that you do

600
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,800
 No, we are saved by grace through faith alone

601
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,780
 But the faith which saves is never alone

602
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,740
 It's never alone

603
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,220
 One of the greatest assurances I have that I really know Jesus and I still sin guys

604
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,500
 But when I sin I hate it when I see anger in me that rules me when I see lust that that is attractive to

605
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,900
 Me and I want to give myself to it. I take that second. Look I I

606
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:57,860
 Want to look and hit the click. I want to move there. I want to make an excuse for watching a movie. I

607
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,020
 Hate it. I hate it. I wish it wasn't in me

608
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,380
 I pray that God remove it and he says Todd my grace is sufficient for you what you got to decide right now

609
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,620
 Are you gonna follow your flesh? Are you gonna live by faith?

610
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:16,780
 The life which I live right now is still inside a flesh that longs for all the sin it's always longed for

611
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,540
 But I by God's kindness

612
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,860
 I know I've been crucified with Christ in the life which I now live I live by faith in the Son of God who loved

613
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,260
 me and

614
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,260
 Delivered himself up for me

615
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,740
 I

616
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,620
 Know the greatest assurances I have that I know Jesus is that when I sin I hate it. I

617
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,420
 confess it I

618
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:44,020
 Forsake it. I tell friends. Hey, we got to do something man. I can't just say I can handle this being in my house

619
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,740
 I got to get rid of it

620
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:52,860
 Because I don't want it to have access. I want to abstain from these fleshly lusts and I'm moving on it and

621
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,820
 Not just saying I know about a cross. I

622
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,460
 Pick it up and I follow him

623
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,460
 I

624
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:08,060
 What do we have tonight we have this just very simple truth the need for repentance friends is clear

625
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,620
 It's clear

626
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,440
 The time for repentance is now

627
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,060
 The evidence of repentance is fruit

628
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,980
 It's a changed life

629
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:32,660
 You're not saved because your life changes your life has been changed by the power and the grace of God

630
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,860
 Let me just read you this last little thing by Lewis and we close and it's just what's going on our world

631
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,140
 I just our world is so confused. What do we do? Is that the Republicans fault is our president's fault?

632
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,700
 Is it the gun manufacturers fault?

633
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,620
 Is it mental health systems fault?

634
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:57,340
 Here's what's going on we have a world that still strives to make sense out of the broken human condition without God

635
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:03,880
 We have stopped teaching ethics and values and morals and repentance in schools. We have shattered the family unit

636
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,380
 We don't hold young men accountable

637
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,340
 We let them isolate and live alone and I'm not blaming video games

638
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,740
 But we put them in a room filled with despair where they live imaginary lives and they practice

639
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
 parasitizing themselves to other humans

640
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,580
 We celebrate it

641
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,700
 We make excuses for it. We enable them with medication and

642
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,580
 We don't do what Jesus did

643
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:39,940
 In a sort of ghastly simplicity, I'm quoting Lewis now we remove the organ and we demand the function

644
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,740
 We take the heart out and we expect goodness to circulate

645
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:49,420
 We make men without chess men without honor and we expect of them virtue and enterprise

646
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,780
 We laugh at honor and we shocked then to find traitors in our midst

647
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,580
 We castrate the gelding and we bid it to be fruitful

648
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,700
 That is a very illustrative saying

649
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:12,660
 And we are neutering ourselves with our godlessness and our refusal to be brokenhearted over our sin

650
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
 What

651
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,660
 America does

652
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:23,140
 In moments like this as we cry we pray it's appropriate, but it's a worldly sorrow

653
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:29,500
 We want the circumstances to stop we deal with the symptoms and we don't deal with the problem

654
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:36,920
 And the problem is in us. It is sin cease striving in a way that seems right to men

655
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,060
 Come to God

656
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
 Father I thank you

657
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,580
 That you have walked with us in the fire of earth that you have been tempted in every way as we have been you have had

658
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,860
 Walmart's

659
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,180
 you've had innocent blood mingled in a random way and

660
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,940
 You took it and you used it to remind us of why?

661
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,300
 Blood is mingled on this earth because it's not heaven

662
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,460
 It's not what you meant to happen on earth

663
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,820
 you wanted men to know you and to walk with you and to trust you and to love one another and

664
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,460
 To live faithfully, but we said we don't need you God. We don't need your love

665
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,640
 We don't need your light. And so we have gotten hatred and we have gotten darkness and we have gotten death

666
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:32,940
 But I thank you in the midst of the death that's in this world there has been another in the fire and he did not sin

667
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,100
 And he loved us enough to go to a cross and

668
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:44,980
 To have his body broken and his blood shed the eternal Son of God the very visible image the

669
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,980
 Inconceivable love of God was revealed in Jesus

670
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,180
 And when we are brokenhearted over our sin and poor in spirit

671
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,980
 We can lift our eyes up and we can see your provision on the cross and we can trust in you and we can say

672
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,860
 I want to follow that love God. Thank you for making a way that I unholy

673
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:07,500
 Todd can come to a holy God boldly and receive grace and mercy in my time of need as can everybody in this room

674
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,820
 Everybody listening

675
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:19,260
 And I pray Lord if there's somebody here who just goes yeah, yeah Todd, that's me I know sins in me

676
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:24,340
 I see sin in the world and I'm gonna deal with a sin in my world and I'm gonna confess it

677
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,580
 I'm gonna be brokenhearted about it

678
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:33,100
 And I'm gonna forsake it and I'm gonna learn to follow God. I'm gonna love God and his people in his word

679
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,660
 I'm not gonna isolate any longer

680
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:42,540
 And this is the day Lord that your patience is allowed for that I should not perish

681
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:47,540
 But I come to you in repentance

682
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,700
 And if that's you you just say in this moment God I come to you. I confess my sin. I see your kindness

683
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,540
 I see your love

684
00:52:54,540 --> 00:53:00,620
 I see that you're a God that's walked on earth filled with insecurity and trouble and you've given us peace. We have faith and

685
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,940
 That gives us peace with God

686
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,060
 And so Lord I have confidence that Jesus is your provision for me

687
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,060
 And I put my faith in him and not in my own works righteousness or not my own

688
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,180
 Plans to stem evil in this world. I trust you and I know Lord

689
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,580
 There's gonna be a day when you're gonna deal with evil completely and I thank you that you're dealing with my evil now by grace

690
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:24,180
 And so Lord let your spirit be loud in my life

691
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,380
 Give me an affection for you and a love for you

692
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,660
 Thank you for rooms

693
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:34,460
 filled with God's people that I can now run to them and say teach me more of my father that I can walk in the

694
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,180
 Kindness and goodness of his way. Thank you that you are a high priest who can sympathize with my weakness

695
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,020
 that you have been through this fire and

696
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:47,540
 You will never leave me or forsake me that you stand ready to come when the father says go

697
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:55,020
 But Lord if you tarry may we be about your business now loving broken people in our Allen's before they get in cars and drive

698
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,100
 to someone else's El Paso

699
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:05,580
 Let us bear fruit let us be your people let us walk with courage in the fire in Jesus name

700
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:15,580
