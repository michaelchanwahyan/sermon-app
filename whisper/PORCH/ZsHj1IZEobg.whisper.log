[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:19.520]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.480]   I shall not want.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.040]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   [SPEAKING CHINESE]
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.640]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400]   all the days of my life.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.880]   And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:20.280]   What's up, Porch?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.320]   Hey, my name is Timothy Atik.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920]   And I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.600]   on Sundays as well as Tuesdays here at the Porch.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800]   If this is your first time here or your last time here,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.480]   I am glad that you made it.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.600]   Welcome.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200]   Want to just say hello to all of our Porch Live
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.880]   locations that are watching--
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.520]   Scottsdale, Tulsa, Des Moines.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.360]   I know you guys are out there, and several others.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.240]   And then I know that some of you are just
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   watching individually from the comfort of your living room.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.640]   Wherever you are in the nation or world,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200]   I'm glad that you are tuning in.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.000]   I have three boys.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.400]   They are 13, 11, and 5.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280]   Their names are Noah, Andrew, and Jake.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.920]   And here's the reality.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160]   I delight in my boys.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.840]   I truly do.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.600]   Like, I delight that they are my sons,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.680]   and I get to be their dad.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.120]   There are things that they do that when they do them,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.920]   it honestly, it melts me in some way.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.040]   So for example, my five-year-old Jake,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.560]   he jumps and skips everywhere.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.600]   So you can be talking to him in the living room,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.320]   and he'll just be sitting there going--
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   and then he'll go into the kitchen like this
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.760]   to get a Rice Krispie treat.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.200]   And I'm like, that's awesome.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.120]   I can't do that.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.520]   If I did that at work tomorrow, it
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.320]   would cause serious questions.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.720]   But you can pull that off, and I respect that, and I love that.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.040]   And then I picked him up the other day,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   and he just kind of buried his head on my shoulder.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   And it was the type of thing where I was like,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.280]   I don't want this moment to end.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.240]   You don't enjoy it nearly as much as I do,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.880]   but I just delight in this moment.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.120]   And then my 11-year-old Andrew, you really
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.960]   have to work on him to get him to laugh.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.640]   But when you get him, he collapses on the floor.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.240]   And it's the best thing, because sometimes he just--
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.360]   his life can feel heavy.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.320]   And so when he laughs and just collapses on the ground,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.040]   there's something inside of me that just explodes.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.480]   It's amazing.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   And then my 13-year-old Noah, as someone
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.920]   who tells stories for a living, that guy can tell a story,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   and he can build it to a climax, and he
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.840]   can deliver a punch in a way that I am
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.880]   like slapping the table laughing.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.760]   And I love that.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.840]   Like, I delight in my son so much.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.280]   And yet, as I was preparing for this message,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.440]   here's the thought that I had.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.800]   I hope they know that.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.400]   Like, I hope that my boys know just how much I delight in them.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.960]   And as I had that realization as a dad to my three boys,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.000]   I kind of felt like my heart was syncing up
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.160]   with the heart of our Heavenly Father.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.360]   And I just sensed that my Father in Heaven
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.080]   was looking at me saying, I hope you know that.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.240]   I hope that you know just how much I delight in you.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.760]   And so I just wonder, if you're here tonight
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.200]   and you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.180]   if you've put your trust in Jesus,
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.720]   you have surrendered your life to Him, you are following Him,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.240]   that makes you a child of God.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.600]   Can you just allow yourself to sync up
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.720]   with the heart of your Heavenly Father tonight
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.600]   and sense Him speaking into your life to you tonight,
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.640]   declaring, I delight in you?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.680]   And the reality is some of you hear that and you don't believe
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.280]   it.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.240]   And that's a problem.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.320]   And we're going to deal with it tonight.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.640]   We've been in a series just walking verse by verse,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.680]   six weeks, five weeks, through Psalm 23.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.180]   If this is your first week here, I'd
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.040]   encourage you to go back and just jump into the series
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.360]   and get caught up.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.720]   But tonight we are ending by talking about the favor of God.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.120]   How do you define the favor of God?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920]   Or what is favor?
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.320]   The best definition I've found for favor
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.600]   is demonstrated delight.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   It is delight that is demonstrated.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.000]   So if favor is demonstrated delight,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.560]   then the question that I have to ask myself as a dad
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.280]   to my three sons is, have I shown them my favor?
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.360]   But that's the wrong question when
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.560]   we're talking about our perfect Heavenly Father.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.360]   The question isn't, has He shown His favor?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.920]   The question is, have we seen His favor?
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.140]   Because God is showing His favor.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.600]   The question is, do we have the spiritual sight
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.520]   to actually see it?
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.240]   And David, the guy who penned the most famous chapter
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.560]   in the entire Bible, Psalm 23, which we have now
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.520]   heard twice tonight, he had eyes to see it.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   And it's amazing.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.280]   David is my favorite character in the Bible besides Jesus.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   Like, if you're just looking for a good book to read,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.240]   like you want to read a novel that is actually true,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.040]   just open up your Bible to 1 Samuel 16
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.840]   and start reading all the way through 2 Samuel.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.720]   You'll read through the life of David.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   It reads like a novel.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.720]   And it's my favorite character in the Bible besides Jesus,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.640]   because his life is so compelling.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.240]   He had really high highs, like he
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.120]   conquered a giant with a sling and a stone.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.560]   And then he had really low lows.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.240]   He slept with another man's wife and basically committed murder.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.720]   He lived on the run for about 15 years,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.560]   because an outgoing king was trying to kill him.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.600]   Four of his kids died prematurely.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.000]   His daughter was raped.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.480]   His best friend was killed.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.880]   Like, his life was full of ups and downs.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.360]   And yet, as we look at the end of Psalm 23,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.840]   what's he able to say?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.800]   He's able to say, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400]   me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.600]   of the Lord forever."
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.640]   Do you know what that is?
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.760]   That is spiritual sight.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.720]   That is David being synced up with his heavenly Father,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.880]   understanding and seeing God's favor upon his life,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.080]   God's demonstrated delight.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.560]   And I just want to invite you into that tonight.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.840]   If you're a child of God, I want you leaving here certain
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.400]   of God's delight in you.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.000]   And if you do not know Jesus Christ, I want you to know God's
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.640]   delight is on the table for you as well.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   So, if you have a Bible, I want to invite you to turn
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.680]   with me tonight to Psalm 23.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.120]   Psalm 23 is where we're going to be.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.880]   And as we look at just this one verse, there's two things that
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.560]   I want you to see about God's favor.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.920]   This verse is going to unpack two things for us, and here it is.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.000]   First, we're going to see that God's favor is revealed.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Remember, we want to see God's favor.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.440]   So, revealed, it's just a word of sight that God is showing
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.520]   his favor to us.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.280]   God's favor is revealed in his pursuit of us.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.240]   In number two, God's favor is revealed in his presence with us.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.360]   So, first, I just want you to see that God's favor is revealed
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.040]   in his pursuit of us.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.680]   What does David say in verse 6?
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.760]   He says, "Surely."
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.240]   Surely, that word in the Hebrew, and when I say in the Hebrew,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   that's just...
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.720]   I say that simply because that's the language that the Old Testament
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.400]   was originally written in.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.800]   So, English is a translation of the Hebrew, but if you were to go and study
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.600]   the Hebrew, that word "surely," it's the equivalent of "certainly."
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.560]   There is confident expectation in it.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   David says, "Certainly, surely, goodness and mercy," we'll get to those
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:51.320]   in a minute, "they shall follow me all the days of my life."
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.080]   That idea of goodness and mercy following David, if you were to go look
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:03.120]   at the Hebrew about that word "follow," it's the equivalent of chasing someone
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   or pursuing them.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.320]   Like, if you were to go and read through the Old Testament and you were to look
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.560]   for all of the times that this Hebrew word is used, it is used primarily in regard
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   to an enemy chasing or pursuing someone.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.080]   So, how fitting is that that David was a guy who lived on the run for years?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.280]   Why?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.920]   Because he was being chased by enemies.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.080]   And now, David is saying, "Look, even more than being chased down by someone
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   who wanted to kill me, there's something else that is coming in hot behind me."
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.400]   And it is the goodness in the mercy of God.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.160]   That's amazing.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.280]   David is saying that one of the ways that the favor of God has been revealed in my
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.320]   life is that God is chasing me down with his goodness and mercy.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.280]   And he tells us the frequency to God's pursuit of him with his goodness and
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.800]   mercy.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.640]   What's the frequency?
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   All the days of my life.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.280]   On the day that David lost his best friend, on all of the four days that each
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.720]   of his four kids died prematurely, on the day that his daughter was raped,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.880]   on the day that one of his sons tried to steal the throne from him,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.240]   on the day that he committed murder, on the day that he committed adultery,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.200]   on the day that he knocked out a giant, on all of those days,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:45.800]   God's goodness in his mercy was chasing him down, which is amazing.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.040]   I mean, do you believe that?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Well, let's just talk about it.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:58.200]   I mean, what do we mean when we say that the goodness of God is pursuing you every
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.000]   day of your life?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.240]   What is the goodness of God?
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:08.880]   A.W. Tozer, who's a famous author and pastor who lived in the early to mid-1900s,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:16.120]   he says this, "The goodness of God is the drive behind all the blessings He,"
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.600]   that's God, "He daily bestows upon us."
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:28.400]   So, it's awesome because A.W. Tozer is in total agreement with David because he
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.480]   says, "The goodness of God, it's the drive, it's the force,
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:42.120]   it's the horsepower behind all of the blessings that God daily bestows upon us."
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.760]   What's interesting is the word "goodness" that is used here is the same exact word
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.880]   that is used back in Genesis chapter 1 when God creates the heavens and the earth.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.920]   If you were to go back and read the very first chapter of the Bible,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.680]   what you would see is that God slips into this rhythm of creating where He speaks
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   something into existence and then He steps back, He observes it,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:14.480]   and He calls it good, which means that it's perfect.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.400]   It is perfectly designed for humans to flourish.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:28.960]   That same goodness, that same creative force that was in God when He spoke the
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.440]   heavens and the earth into being, that same force is what is behind God's
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.320]   goodness in your life.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.160]   So, I just want you to think about this.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.600]   If there was a book that chronicled every day of your life, then according to David
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.360]   here, on every single page of your life, it would read, "And God saw all that He did
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.760]   in your life that day, and it was good."
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.240]   God saw all the ways that He provided for you today.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.040]   He saw all the ways that He protected you, all the ways that He led you,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.080]   all the ways that He comforted you and strengthened you, all the ways that He
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:15.680]   sustained you and even disciplined you, and behold, it was good.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.720]   Now, this is where, guys, I'm just going to be honest with you,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.920]   this is where we have to have an honest conversation.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:31.280]   Because the reason that people walk away from God, it really doesn't come down to
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.040]   they just stopped believing in God.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.720]   You know what it comes down to?
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   They stopped believing in the goodness of God.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.320]   And I just want...
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.440]   I want to be very honest with you.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   I've shared in this series multiple times that 2022 was the hardest year of my life.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:58.320]   And there were times during that year that I got frustrated with God, truly.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.440]   And there were times where I questioned God's goodness.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.400]   What's interesting is I sat with a group of people who have all been walking
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.200]   with God for decades.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.240]   I just sat with them within the past week.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.080]   And everyone was sharing about trials in their life.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.640]   And I specifically remember one of those people who's been walking with the Lord
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:26.400]   for decades just saying, "I've struggled to believe that God is good even in the
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   midst of this situation in my life."
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.800]   That's a real deal.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.520]   That's a real struggle.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.000]   Why?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.600]   Because we equate God's goodness with material blessing and ease and comfort.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.120]   So if life is tough and things don't go well, then we begin to question that God
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.680]   is good.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.880]   So this is where we just have to...we have to make a decision.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.640]   Can God still be good and your life be falling apart?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.800]   Is that possible?
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.320]   And where I've landed is that God's goodness sometimes shows up in the form
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.400]   of material blessing.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.520]   It sometimes shows up in the form of ease and everything is as it should be.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.280]   Like, when I met my wife, God is good.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.680]   When we had each of our three kids, God is good.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   When I got a new job, God is good.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:37.600]   And yet God's goodness doesn't always come in the form of material blessing.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:48.080]   Sometimes God's goodness comes in the form of Him holding you up and sustaining you
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   in the midst of a raging storm in life.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:59.040]   Like, sometimes God's goodness is just the fact that you are still standing,
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.200]   even though you're barely standing, the fact that you're still here,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   the fact that you're still hanging on, the fact that you chose to live another
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.880]   day, that is all a display of God's goodness in your life.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:23.800]   And so even today, like, I stood down there, I needed worship tonight so much
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.000]   because you know what those songs forced me to do?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.440]   They forced me to declare, they forced me to make a decision.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   That even when there have been things this week that have not gone how I wanted
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.600]   them to go and I had to make a decision tonight, is God good even in the midst
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.680]   of things not going how I want them to go?
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.320]   And I was able to worship with complete confidence, "Yes, God,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:55.120]   you are good because I'm still here, I'm still standing."
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.520]   And so you just have to make a choice, you have to make a decision.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.080]   Is God good or not?
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.560]   My encouragement to you is even in the toughest times in life, be faithful.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:09.880]   Why?
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.640]   Because I promise you a day is going to come where you are going
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.400]   to get perspective.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.480]   There's a character in the Old Testament.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   And if you're not familiar with the Bible and you're like,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.080]   "What is the Old Testament?"
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.480]   It's basically the first two-thirds of the Bible.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.560]   So if you were to go back and look at the beginning, there's a guy named Joseph who
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.720]   had a miserable life.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.240]   You're like, "Well, how miserable could it be?"
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.560]   Well, his brothers took him, threw him into a well, and then pulled him
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.080]   out of it and sold him into slavery.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   That's a bad life.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.760]   When he was sold into slavery, things began to turn around for him.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:49.280]   And then he got thrown into prison because he was wrongfully accused.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.160]   So he spent two years in prison.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   That's a bad deal.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.400]   Later, a couple of decades later, he's reunited with the brothers that threw him
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   or sold him into slavery.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.440]   And listen to the perspective that this guy has.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.360]   This is in Genesis 50, verse 20.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.640]   He says, "As for you," talking to his brothers, "you meant evil against me,
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.200]   but God meant it for good."
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.400]   Why?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.760]   To bring about that many people should be kept alive as they are today.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.680]   See, here's the reality.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.800]   He was sold into slavery.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.880]   He was taken into Egypt.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.240]   And you know what happened?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.760]   God's favor was upon Joseph in such a way that even when he was in prison,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.440]   he got called out of prison and then promoted to being the number two person
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.840]   in the nation of Egypt.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.480]   And he led the country through a severe famine, and he was able to provide for his
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.000]   brothers who desperately needed food.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.840]   So he gets this perspective of like, "You know what?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.200]   You meant it as evil against me.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   But now I see that when I was thrown into that well, and then you sold me
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   into slavery, and then I was put in prison, it was all the goodness of God."
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.440]   There's been times over the 13 years that Cat and I have been parents that we've
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.480]   made the poor choice to try and fly with small children.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.840]   And if you get married and have kids one day, just email me after you fly with them
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.720]   for the first time.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.520]   All you have to say is, "Totally get it."
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.480]   Because here's the deal, when you fly with small kids, they either make you look
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.360]   like incredible parents or like buffoons.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.040]   Like, it's one or the other.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.560]   You either look like a terrible parent or you look amazing.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.720]   It's always a coin toss.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.760]   The kid has complete control over you.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.320]   When you get onto that airplane, that kid is like, "Excellent."
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.880]   Like when they say, "The doors are shut.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.760]   We're ready for takeoff."
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.880]   They're like, "That's all I needed to hear."
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.360]   And then they lose their ever-loving mind.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   But here's...I still remember.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.000]   This was a few years back.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.800]   My five-year-old Jake, he was about a year and a half old at the time we were
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.520]   flying from Colorado to Dallas.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.800]   Just in the middle of the flight.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.440]   We're about an hour in.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.840]   He just gets up to the best of his ability to communicate.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.640]   What he is communicating to me is, "I'm ready to get off this plane now."
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.280]   Like, up to this point, it's been great.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.440]   Takeoff was exhilarating.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.880]   All of the ways you've tried to distract me with screens and stickers, I applaud you,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.360]   Dad, for all of your effort.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.880]   But now, I've had enough.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.160]   We just need to walk down this aisle and we need to get off this plane.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.120]   It's very hard to reason with a one-and-a-half-year-old.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.560]   It's very hard to help them understand, "Hey, dude, if they opened up that door
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:54.040]   right now and we stepped off this plane, we wouldn't be where you think we would be."
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.760]   See, the reality is that is how we are in life sometimes.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.240]   Sometimes, because of our limited perspective, just like my son Jake,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.040]   he had a limited perspective.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.480]   We have a limited perspective and there's times in life where life gets turbulent and
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   we just get to a point where we're like, "God, this has been good, but it's time
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.800]   to get off this flight.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.480]   I'm ready to be done."
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:31.480]   But what we don't realize is if we stepped off that flight, then and there, we wouldn't
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.800]   be where we think we want to be.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.840]   The reality is just like on that flight, we had a captain, we had a pilot who knew
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.160]   the destination we were headed.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.920]   He knew that even amidst all the turbulence we were experiencing, he was taking us to
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.960]   the place that we ultimately wanted to be.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.480]   The same is true with God.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.880]   We have a limited perspective and yet we have a perfect captain, pilot, who knows where
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.400]   he's taking us.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.080]   Even in the midst of all the turbulence, even in the midst of everything that we look at
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.520]   and say, "Clearly, this is not good," God can look and say, "I know where I'm
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.800]   taking you and honestly, if you could see what I see, you wouldn't change a thing."
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.120]   And so it's just good for us to realize we cannot see what he sees.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.000]   He is good.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   Surely goodness will follow us all the days of our lives.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.340]   You know what I love about Psalm 23?
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:40.240]   If you were to go and you were to look at the verbs in Psalm 23, you would see, "The
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.080]   Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.820]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.360]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake."
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.640]   So the picture in the first half of the Psalm is God is going before me.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   He's leading me.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   He's leading me.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   He's leading me.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.520]   And then you get to the end and what does David say?
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.160]   "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me."
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.440]   So God isn't just leading, he's actually following.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.640]   He's going before you and he's coming behind you because he cares about you.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.640]   You know what that is?
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.840]   That is demonstrated delight.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.960]   It's the favor of God.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:26.080]   But David goes on and says, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.680]   my life."
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:35.880]   Mercy in the Hebrew, the original language that it was written in, it's the word hesed.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.760]   Hesed speaks of the steadfast love of God.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.580]   There's an author, his name's Paul Miller.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.760]   He wrote an entire book, it's just called A Loving Wife.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:56.000]   It is a book devoted solely to the one word hesed, unpacking the idea of hesed love.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   And this is how he explains hesed love, which has been translated as mercy here in Psalm
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   23.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.920]   Some translations translate it as loving kindness.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.960]   He explains hesed love as one way love.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.000]   It's a combination of commitment and sacrifice.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.600]   I love this.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.020]   It's love without an exit strategy.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.760]   You bind yourself to the object of your love no matter their response.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.960]   Hesed love doesn't act on feelings, it acts on commitments.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.560]   It is a stubborn love.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.480]   I love that.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:44.720]   So David is saying, "Look, I am certain that there is this stubborn love that is chasing
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.000]   me down relentlessly every single day of my life."
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.740]   Even on the day that he committed adultery.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.800]   Even on the days that he was leading his country through a multiple year famine.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:07.420]   That stubborn love, that love without an exit strategy was on his tail.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   As I was preparing for this message, I realized that I was prepping to teach something that
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.380]   I wasn't applying in my own life.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:33.420]   And as I just sat there and I thought about God's stubborn love for me, it overwhelmed
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:43.240]   me just thinking, "God, you have never given up on me.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.940]   You've never even come close to giving up on me."
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.840]   And you're like, "Well, you're a pastor.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.880]   You're like one of those professional Christians.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.740]   You get paid to do this.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.740]   Clearly you do it right."
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.120]   No.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:05.480]   Like, let me just tell you the thoughts that went through my mind after all the days that
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.260]   I, a pastor, have ignored God.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.660]   After all the self-sufficiency.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.780]   After all the times that I've prioritized other things above God.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.440]   After all the careless and hurtful words that I've spoken towards others, or the bitterness
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:30.320]   that I've harbored in my heart, or the gluttony, or the lust, or the pride, the manipulation
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:41.680]   of others, the selfishness, the attempts to use God for my own glory, not once has he
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:51.280]   even come close to giving up on me, and not once has he withheld his love from me.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.560]   Not once.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:28:02.920]   Instead, he has been relentlessly chasing me down with his hesed love.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.160]   So I just want you to know that that is true of you too tonight.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.080]   Like, I don't know what you think when I say all that.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:16.120]   I don't know if you, I don't know if you will just allow the truth of God's Word to cut
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.760]   through all of the lies that your enemy is whispering into your ear when I say these
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.120]   things.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.760]   Like that small voice in your mind that's like, "Yeah, but."
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.240]   I'm like, "It's chasing you down."
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.840]   He's like, "Yeah, it is, but not for you.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.480]   For you would be able to experience, but you've failed and so you can't."
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:46.080]   Like, whatever that voice is, tell it to shut up, because the Word of God, it tells us,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.240]   "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:04.640]   And so, I tell you that just to say, God's favor is revealed in his pursuit of us.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:10.320]   And then number two, God's favor is revealed in his presence with us.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.600]   Look at how David finishes.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.480]   This is the finale to the psalm.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.760]   He says, "I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.200]   You know, when we read that verse, what is our natural inclination?
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.920]   Our natural inclination is to think that David is talking about heaven, like eternity with
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   God.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.560]   But if you were to go and read the top commentators, the top academics, and what they think David
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.360]   is trying to convey, you know what they would say?
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.720]   And I agree with them.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.360]   What they would say is that that is one application of what David is saying, but it isn't the
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.880]   immediate meaning or application.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.800]   See, when David says, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord," what was the house of
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   the Lord?
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:00.040]   Well, at David's time, it was the tabernacle, and then David's son Solomon would build the
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.360]   temple.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.280]   The tabernacle, which became the temple, that was the house of God.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:13.280]   It was the structure that was built in God's presence actually filled a room of the temple.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.680]   And so the nation of Israel would come to the house or the temple of God to meet with
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.200]   God.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   So what David is saying, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever," that word
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.400]   forever, if you go and look at the original language, the Hebrew, it can also be translated
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.440]   for length of days.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.000]   So David is saying, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord for the length of my days."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.240]   So what's another way to translate what David is saying?
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.280]   He's simply saying, "I will enjoy access to the presence of God every day for the rest
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.960]   of my life."
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.560]   That's what he's saying.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.240]   If you were to go and read the Bible from cover to cover, do you know what one theme
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.200]   you would see from start to finish?
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.640]   It's this, God is committed to being present with His people.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:10.840]   So if you look at the beginning of the Bible, in the first two chapters, you know what you
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   see?
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.100]   You see the first human beings, Adam and Eve, they actually like walk with God.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.120]   They take walks with Him.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.240]   And in the third chapter, you know what the greatest consequence is for the rebellion
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.800]   against God?
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.520]   They get removed from the tangible, visible presence of God.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.960]   It's the greatest consequence they experienced.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   But God didn't leave His people to themselves.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.960]   So He began to cultivate a nation, the nation of Israel.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   And what did He do?
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.080]   He had them build a tabernacle, which was a house.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.640]   And when they built that tabernacle, what did God do?
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.340]   His presence filled a room in the temple.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.320]   And when the nation of Israel was wandering through the wilderness, how did God lead them?
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.840]   He led them as a cloud during the day and as a pillar of fire at night, so that the
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   nation of Israel could always look and say, "God is here."
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.960]   Jesus shows up in the New Testament.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.960]   What is He called?
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.100]   Emmanuel, which means what?
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.800]   God with us.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.360]   Jesus dies on a cross for your sins and mine.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   He's buried in a tomb.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.680]   He rises from the dead.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.820]   He ascends into heaven.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.240]   He sits down at the right hand of the Father.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.600]   And who does He send?
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.260]   He sends the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.820]   What does the Holy Spirit do for every person who puts their trust in Christ?
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.780]   The Spirit of God indwells them, which means the Spirit of God, God Himself actually lives
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.780]   inside of you.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.820]   If you were to fast forward to the second to last chapter in the entire Bible, Revelation
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.000]   21, do you know what it says?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.660]   It says the dwelling place of God is with man.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.760]   So from start to finish, what's the message?
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.580]   God is committed to being present with His people.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.480]   David got that.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.600]   He got that.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.360]   So here's what I want you to think about.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.920]   I just want you to think about this.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.480]   God has been with you every single second today.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.620]   Does that do anything to you?
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.680]   The God of the universe, when you woke up this morning, He was in your room.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   It's like, finally.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   Just get going.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.900]   When you're eating breakfast, He's at the table.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.480]   When you're working out, He is not working out.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   He's God.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.960]   He's not talking to you, but He's still there.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.760]   When you're sitting at your cubicle or wherever you sit, He is right there with you.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.120]   When you were driving in your car, He was driving with you.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.960]   And God's presence isn't passive.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.560]   Like He is actually very involved in your life.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.860]   He's strategically thinking about you.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.040]   He is with you.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.240]   He's listening for you to speak to Him.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.280]   He's trying to communicate to you.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:13.360]   He is present with you every single moment of every day.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.460]   Our tendency is to believe the lie that God is only really present during the monumental
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.960]   times in our lives.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.720]   You graduate college, man, God was there.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   You got your first job.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.800]   Praise God, you were there.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.960]   You think you meet your spouse.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   God is here.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.480]   You get a ring on your finger.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.680]   He's definitely here.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.560]   He's only really there in the monumental times.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.840]   And what David is reminding us, He's there in the monumental times, but He's also there
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.240]   in the mundane times.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.880]   He's there every moment of every day.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.680]   He's there in the highs and lows.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.040]   Like He was there when I felt like I hit rock bottom in my sin right out of college.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.680]   He was there when I started dating Kat.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.800]   He was there when my friend passed away in Iraq.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.960]   He was there when our son went into the NICU.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.120]   He was there when we moved from Austin to Waco.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.140]   And when we moved from Waco to College Station, He was there when we moved from College Station
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.000]   to Dallas.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.480]   He was there when we had a miscarriage.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:26.440]   He was there when we have navigated some serious challenges with one of our kids.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.140]   And yet, here's my fear.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:35.960]   I don't want to wait till I get to heaven to then get perspective and realize, "Oh,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.960]   shoot.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.600]   You weren't just there in the monumental times.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:46.880]   You were there when I was sitting in my home office every single second of the pandemic.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.200]   You were there every time I was binging Netflix.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.160]   You were there every time I was driving in the car.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.740]   You were there that one time I went for a run.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.480]   You were there.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.840]   Every single moment of every day, every time I had to make a decision, every time I felt
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.240]   down or alone, every time I didn't know what to do, every time I didn't know if I was going
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:17.120]   to make it another day, every time I wondered about my future, every time I stressed out,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.880]   every time I felt like I was carrying too much, every time I felt laid down by life,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.780]   every time I felt like a failure, every time I didn't feel like I was enough, every moment
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:33.240]   of laughter with my wife, every sweet moment with my kids, you were there."
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   You know what that is?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.040]   That's demonstrated delight.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.160]   That's God's favor.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.680]   Can you imagine how different your life would be if you woke up and realized, "God, you
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.960]   are here and I get to meet with you."
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.280]   You know what we're like?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.320]   So I went to college at Texas A&M University.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.500]   It's good to see you.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   And here's the deal.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:06.240]   I would go to football games and the glorious Kyle Field holds 100,000 people.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.880]   And what's crazy, I've maybe shared this with you before, but people will actually bring
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:16.100]   their infants, their kids to football games at Kyle Field, which is crazy.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:25.380]   And people can be yelling like crazy, and besides last year, all the years around it,
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:33.460]   like you can see some amazing displays of greatness, empower.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.380]   And there are babies who can sleep through all of it.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.760]   It's crazy.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.640]   And yet that's what we often do every single day.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:52.340]   God is with us and He is putting His goodness and His greatness, His power on display.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.020]   And we are sleeping like babies to His presence.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.900]   Like I want to live awake.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.860]   Like I don't want to wake up and believe that God is only there for the 30 minutes that
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   I'm at home with my Bible open.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.600]   Like when I shut my Bible and say, "Amen," God's like, "Great, let's go."
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.020]   And He's leaving with me.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.660]   And He's going to be there every second of every day.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:23.540]   So I want to live awake to His favor in my life.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.100]   It's demonstrated delight.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:32.180]   God's favor is revealed in His pursuit of us, and His favor is revealed in His presence
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.180]   with us.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   So what do we do with this?
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.900]   Here's what I want you to know.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:41.100]   There's an invitation on the table tonight for every single person in this room.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.620]   Every person in this room, and I hope you don't miss the invitation.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.540]   Because every invitation deserves a response.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.500]   If you're here tonight and you have a personal relationship with Jesus, here's what I mean
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.500]   by that.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.420]   I mean you have come to a place where you have recognized your desperate need for a
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.500]   Savior from your rebellion against God.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.580]   And you have come to a place where you have spoken to Jesus Christ and you have told Him,
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:13.020]   "I desperately need your work on the cross to count for me."
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.420]   If you've made that decision, then the invitation to you tonight is just recognition.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:25.380]   It's an invitation to recognition that you would recognize tonight God's pursuit of you.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.060]   That every single day He's chasing you down with His goodness.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.540]   Even if today is a day where you have questioned whether you even want to live, you need to
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.900]   know His goodness is chasing you down.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.140]   His chesed love is chasing you down.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.820]   Recognize that.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.100]   Recognize that He's with you.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:49.100]   Now don't leave this place until you do business with the Lord and just sit and allow His goodness
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.820]   and His love to spill into your life.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.220]   It's an invitation to recognition.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.900]   But if you're here tonight and you do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.580]   are not a Christian.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:08.620]   You have never truly understood why Jesus is important.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.700]   It's an invitation to redemption.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.660]   It's an invitation to redemption.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.980]   See if you want to be able to confidently say, "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:25.100]   me all the days of my life," here's what you first have to realize.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.700]   What you first have to realize is that goodness and mercy already went before you in the person
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.020]   of Jesus Christ to the cross.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.980]   And when Jesus Christ hung on the cross, it was the greatest display of goodness that
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.440]   our world has ever seen.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:45.100]   Because in that moment, God Himself left heaven and came to earth.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:50.640]   He lived the perfect life that you and I could not live.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.080]   And He substituted Himself in our place.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.300]   He was punished so that we wouldn't have to be.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.620]   That's His goodness.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.300]   That's His chesed love.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:09.340]   That's a stubborn love, that He would die for His enemies, and then He would rise from
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.580]   the dead, conquering our sin.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.700]   If you don't know Jesus Christ, you can leave here tonight confidently saying, "Surely goodness
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.540]   and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.300]   But first you have to respond to an invitation to redemption.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.140]   And it comes in realizing who Jesus is and what He's done, that He is the epitome of
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:36.020]   goodness and mercy that has gone to the cross for you.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.940]   How will you respond tonight?
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:44.660]   "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.740]   in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:42:05.180]   Let's pray together.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   I'm just going to ask, just with your eyes closed, I'm not looking to tweak anyone's
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.940]   emotions right now, I just want to ask, if you're here tonight, just with your eyes closed,
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.740]   if you want to say yes to Jesus, if you want to put your trust in Him tonight, if you want
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:25.340]   to begin a relationship with Jesus, then let me just ask you to put your hand up real quick
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.860]   so I know exactly who I'm talking to in this place.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.700]   We can just have a quick conversation.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   That's awesome.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.700]   That's great.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.220]   If that's you, you can put your hands down.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.780]   And here's what I want to invite you to do right now, just right where you are, just
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.100]   be very clear with God.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:47.580]   There's no rabbit's foot prayer, but you can just tell Him, just say, "Lord Jesus, would
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:52.100]   you come into my life tonight?"
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:57.460]   Just tell Him, say, "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:03.380]   Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me."
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   Ask Him for forgiveness.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.060]   "Lord Jesus, forgive me of my sins.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.820]   I give my life to you tonight.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.060]   Would you be my Savior?
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:26.340]   Would you lead me in a new life as my King?"
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.860]   If that's you, welcome to the family of God.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   And just for everyone in the room, this is a moment for you to do business with the Lord.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   Don't rush past the fact that God's goodness is here for you tonight, that He's present
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:49.460]   here right now, wants to meet with you, that His love for you is so stubborn that not even
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.500]   you can shake it.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.460]   Would you just let Him speak to your heart?
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.260]   Would you just open up your life to Him right now?
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.480]   You can even put your hands out just as a demonstration that you are available to Him
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.340]   right now.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.180]   Would you just ask Him to speak to you?
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.580]   Whatever He wants to say, just say, "God, I want to hear from you right now.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.580]   Would you speak to me?
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:17.300]   Lord Jesus, you are a good King.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.660]   You are good.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.820]   I thank you for who you are and what you've done.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.460]   I thank you for how much you love us.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:30.220]   I pray your goodness and mercy that it would just feel like you are chasing us down and
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:35.580]   you have caught us and you're going to smother us with your goodness and mercy.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   I pray that for us right now.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.700]   And I just pray that your presence would be very real to us now.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.700]   We need you.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.820]   We love you.
