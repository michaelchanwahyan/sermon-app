[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   I saw this godly woman on the Facebooks the other day. She had like so many scripture verses.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   You poked her yet? I'm thinking about it.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   Have you snapchatted her yet?
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   Totally endorse her communication skills. Yeah?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   Docked her on Twitter yet?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.800]   You want me to ask her out for you? Would you?
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800]   Should I text her to ask her out?
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800]   Send a group text.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   First date, I'm going to take her to my cousin's wedding. What do you think?
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   Free dinner. Great idea.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800]   Should I ask her dad for permission to take her on a first date?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800]   What is this, 1950?
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   Awww.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800]   (music)
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   (music)
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   (music)
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   (music)
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800]   Looked like a little bit of friendationship was going on there.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   A little accountability for those guys.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   What's going on? How are we doing this evening?
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   (cheers)
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800]   Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   Got folks tuning in in Houston.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800]   If you're listening around the world, we're glad
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   you're with us as we move through
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   this series called Save the Date.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   Save the Date.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   I thought I'd start here. It's fall.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   I love fall. Anybody else love fall?
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   (cheers)
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   Pumpkin spice lattes. Got to.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   The weather starts to turn.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   It's tolerable in Texas.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   Fall reminds me.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   It begins to lift my spirits
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   because I begin to think about
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   my favorite time, which is Christmas.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   Love Christmas.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   I don't know if you guys do Christmas parties,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   but Watermark staff's
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   Christmas parties are epic.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   Epic.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   I don't know what your Christmas parties
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   are like. I'm confident they're
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   very different than ours, but ours
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   are epic.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   I just want to tell you about what this looks like.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   Todd is the king of fun. He's the senior
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   pastor here.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   We have some competitions
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   and we're all poor pastors.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   There's losers and winners.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   The losers lose big.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   For example, the loser last year
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   had to spend the night in a dunk tank
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   and it was snowing outside.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   Winners win big.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   Somebody will donate a prize.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   For example, all expense paid trip
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   to Costa Rica, four seasons.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   We're not playing around.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   There's winners and losers. It's like Hunger Games
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   on staff. People die.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   No, people don't die.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   You go big.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   I've had to do crazy. I've never won,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   but I've tried really hard.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   A couple years ago,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   I had to bob for fruitcake
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   in eggnog.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   There we go.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Scary. I know.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   Two years ago,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   I was a human
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   gingerbread man.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   They covered me in maple syrup,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   covered me in powdered sugar.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   That's after
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   I got up and all the stuff had fallen off me.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   That's our Christmas party.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   We're not even drunk.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   Completely sober.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   Crazy Christmas party.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Here's the deal.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   A year ago,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   I'm there. I'm with my wife.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   He says, "Okay.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   "You get to choose. You can go at this
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   "alone if you're on staff,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   "or you can bring your spouse in with you
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   "and double your chances of winning,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   "but also double your chances
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   "of losing. What do you
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   "want to do?" I'm in this real predicament.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   Okay? Because Monica's
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   there and she's like, "Yeah, you know,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   "but wait a minute.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   "I need to know something. What do I need to know?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   "What are we going to be doing?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   "Is she good at that?"
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Whatever it is. Are we going to be doing something
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   she's good at? Are we going to be doing something
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   that ... I need to know what the
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   purpose is before I can choose if I want
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   to go at it alone or not.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   Likewise, okay? As we talk
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   about marriage and singleness,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   you have to first determine
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   your purpose, why you're actually
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   here so you can determine, one,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   do you want to bring someone into that purpose
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   to help you fulfill that purpose?
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Two, who do you want to bring?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   Like, who's going to help you fulfill your purpose?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   Who's going to help you do
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   what it is you were put
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   here
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   to do?
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   If I had something that I wanted you to accomplish
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   and I said, "Hey, you can choose to partner up or go at it
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   "alone," you're going to first ask me,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   "Hey, what do you want me to
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   "accomplish?"
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   God didn't put you here on accident.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   He didn't, like,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   mess up. He didn't, like, forget what he was doing.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   Like, turn his eyes from the factory
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   and all of a sudden you were produced. No, like, He
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   thought about you before the beginning of time.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   He brought you into this place,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   time and space, to accomplish
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   something very
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   specifically geared towards you.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   And in the
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   broadest terms,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   here's your purpose. I'm going to give it to you from the Scripture.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   From Genesis to Revelation, it's really
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   repeated.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   To glorify God in all
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   that you do.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   Now that can feel, like, big and ambiguous,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   but in broad terms,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   from the Bible,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   repeated over
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   and over, to glorify God
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   in all that you do. Now, if you know
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   that's your purpose, then you can begin to think about,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   "Hey, do I want to bring
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   someone into the equation to help
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   me fulfill that purpose?"
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   But it also
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   tells you something else. If that's your purpose, to glorify
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   God in all that you do, I want you to lean forward on this.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   Listen, I just told you why you have breath
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   in your lungs, why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   You want to know why you're alive. It's not to
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   get as many pleasures as you can, to build
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   the biggest tower you can, to have as much
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   stuff as you can, to be the most known,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   to have as many kids as you can.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   It's to
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   glorify God
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   in all that you do.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   And the beautiful thing about that
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   purpose is
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   you don't have to wait until you're married
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   to fulfill that purpose. You can do
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   that today,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   right now, as you
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   leave here, when you wake up tomorrow.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   You can begin
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   to say, "Okay, I've got so many years left.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   I'm going to begin to live my purpose
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   to glorify God in all
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   that I do."
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   So tonight, we're talking about,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   as we move through this series, Save the Date,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   a dating series here at The Porch,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   singleness on
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   purpose.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Everybody's favorite topic, singleness.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   Yeah, everybody clap for singleness.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   We're here, we're talking about singleness. We love singleness.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   That guy does.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   Thank you, David.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   And so here's the deal. Let me shoot you real straight
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   before we dive in. Disclaimer out of the way.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   I'm married.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   What does a married dude know
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   about singleness?
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   What are you going to teach? How are you going to empathize?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   But you think I forgot about it?
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   You think I forgot what it was like
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   to be single? I was single in Dallas.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   I was looking for a spouse.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   So let me
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   ask you a question. Who is the most
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   qualified person to speak? Because every time
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   I go at this, Satan attacks me the same way.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   I've given this message, or one really similar,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   every single
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   year because it's so important.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   And every time I step to the pulpit to give
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   this message, Satan attacks me the same way.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   He says, "Man, you can't talk to them about that.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   That's not where you're at. They're not going to trust you.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   They're not going to believe you." And then every time
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   I begin to dwell on those thoughts,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   the Lord just comes and says, "Bro,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   you are so
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   qualified to talk to them
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   about this from my scriptures because you lived it.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   You did it wrong. You did it right
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   at times. You can tell them from the
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   mistakes you've made."
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Who is better off to tell you
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   something from the scriptures than someone
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   who's never been there, never seen the
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   next chapter, or someone who's been to the next chapter
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   and says, "Bro, I remember when I was there,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   and this is what I wish I would have known."
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   So let's dive in. This is what I wish I would have known.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   Tonight we're talking about singleness on
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   purpose. I'm going to be in
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   1 Corinthians chapter 7, if you want to
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   turn there. 1 Corinthians
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   chapter 7, that's in the New Testament.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Paul's letter to the church in Corinth.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   I'll set
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   this up.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   It's written about 56 AD.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   There's some really specific context
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   going on here when Paul writes this letter.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   The church is under
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   intense persecution,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   and the apostle Paul, being a prophet,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   knows that this is going to be
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   intensified. He's right because Nero shows up
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   on the scene, Emperor Nero, about 10 years
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   later, where he takes persecution
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   of Christians to a sport.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   He has fun with it. He does it for entertainment.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   He stitches animal skin to
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   them and releases
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   rabid dogs. Dogs tear
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   Christians apart, and people watch for entertainment.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   It's a whole other level of wickedness.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   Paul anticipates this.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   He knows that it's coming, and so he begins
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   to write this letter. "Hey, you need to get ready."
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   I'm going to start
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   in verses 7, 8, and
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   9. What's beautiful is
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   verses 7, 8, and 9 are really a preview
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   where he opens up into a commentary
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   there in verse 32. He expounds
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   on these verses in verse
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   32, and that's where we'll spend the rest of our time.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   Where I'm going to take you is the gift
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   of singleness, the purpose
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   of the gift, and why
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   self-control is important
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   when understanding this gift.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   So verse 7. "I wish
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   that all of you were as I am," Paul writes.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   Now, when he says "I am," he's talking about
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   his Facebook status of
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   singleness. He's single.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   When he says, "Hey, I wish you were like me,"
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   he means, "Hey, I wish you were
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   single like me." But each of you
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   has your own, what's that word?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Gift from
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   God. One has this gift.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   Another has that.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Now, to the unmarried and the
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   widows, I say, "It is good for them to
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   stay unmarried as I do.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   But if they cannot,"
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   what? "control
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   themselves, they should
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   marry, for it is better to marry
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   than to burn with passion." So
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   right off the bat, Paul says, "Hey,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   there's this thing that I have. It's called singleness,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   and it's a gift."
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   The Greek word there is
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   charisma.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   It literally translates, "the gift
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   of God's grace."
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   It's where we get the word charis, where the word
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   charity comes from.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   And it translates directly,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   "grace of God."
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   You have a gift,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   intentionally. And so my first point is, singleness
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   is a gift.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   Now, you're
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   here, and you're like, "Wait a minute. How do I
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   know if I have the
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   gift of singleness?"
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   And I'm going to help you find out right now, okay?
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Every person here tonight,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   and if you're listening in your car, wherever you're at,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   Houston, Fort Worth, I want
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   you to raise your hand if you
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   are not married. Raise your hand
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   if you're not married, real high. Now, I see some of you,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   "Oh, wow." Look, there's a lot of you.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   Wow, okay. Lots of hands went
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   in the air. Okay.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   If you're married here, you're outnumbered, evidently.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   Alright, here's the deal.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   You have the gift of singleness.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   Every single person who just
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   raised their hands, and those of you who were
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   scared to, have the gift of singleness.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   Now, what did he just do?
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   Did he just tell me that I'm going to be single? No.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   No, no, no. Calm down.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   Okay? Let your pulse
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   go back to normal. Listen.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   You're single today,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   so today you have the gift of singleness.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   And God says it's a gift,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   so today, this morning, you woke up, you
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   were not married, and so today
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   you have a gift to steward.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   You have the gift, given
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   to you by God, for God, to do
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   something with, for God.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   That's what gifts in the scripture are.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   He's given you a gift, and he's entrusted
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   it to you, for him.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   That you would steward it for his
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   purposes.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   That we would know singleness
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   is a gift. Now, I know some of you
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   feel like it's the white elephant gift you got stuck
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   with, that nobody wants to take.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Anybody want my gift? It's really good.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   But listen.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   There are several wrong views of this gift
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   in culture today. Two
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   main ones. There's an eastern
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   cultural miss
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   on this gift, and there's a western
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   cultural miss on this gift.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   Let me explain the eastern cultural
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   miss first.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   This is how the eastern
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   culture has completely
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   botched this gift.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   They come up and they say, "Hey, you
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   are nothing unless you're married.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   The greatest goal in life is to get a
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   family. That's your legacy. Without
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   a legacy, you have no memory.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   So as soon as you effectively
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   and efficiently can, you need
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   to convince someone to marry you
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   and start a family.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   Because without a family, you're nothing.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Now, some of you
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   came from this influence.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   This influence has actually
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   leaked into some western influences.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   So maybe you return, you go home
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   for Christmas,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   and mom or grandma's like,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   "I mean,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   doesn't anybody like you?"
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   And you're like, "Oh, thanks."
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   "Do you not want
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   to be married?"
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   You know, you're like, "Hey mom, it's not really up to me."
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   "Hey, I mean,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   aren't there any nice guys
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   or aren't there any nice young ladies
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   where you live?" And you're like, "Dude, get off my
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   back." And so then you don't go
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   home anymore. I get it.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   The western
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   culture error,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   or the western culture
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   miss on this gift
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   is that this life
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   is to create
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   an empire.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   It's all about you
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   and the pleasures that you can absorb
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   and the securities that you can surround yourself
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   with. You are building a tower
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   to you of which a
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   spouse or a family is
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   simply a brick in that tower
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   should you choose one. If you don't
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   need one, all the more power to
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   you, okay? But if you want one,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   get one, and it's an accessory.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   Just make sure
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   that you can afford one.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   Make sure that you're completely
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   independent first, that you have
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   everything that you need, and
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   that you have built this tower of money,
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   a resume, possessions, successes,
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   ambitions first.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   And as long as you find the
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   right one, you can add them to the list.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   And that's also a miss.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   It's untrue. It's unbiblical.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   It's a terrible way of
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   thinking and living. And so the result
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   of the Eastern error is that
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   a spouse is necessary for survival,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   so you actually get married to survive
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   financially in that world.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   And the
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   result of the Western culture
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   error is that you don't get
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   married until you can afford to.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   That marriage is this very
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   expensive accessory
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   that it's a wedding, you bought into this
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   lie, this culture that you live in, and
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   so until you can afford it, you don't even think
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   about it. And they're both wrong.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   Because God says singleness
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   is a gift. He says marriage
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   is good, but He says singleness is
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   good too. And He has purposes
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   in it. He has
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   something you want to accomplish.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   And so what are good reasons
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   to be married? We covered this last week, just
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   as a review, because God says it's good,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   because it is a strategy
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   to make disciples by raising children
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   in a family unit,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   and because it is a picture of
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   God's commitment to us. A
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   metaphor of Jesus and the church.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   Our bridegroom married to His
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   bride, the church. God invented
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   marriage, and He invented it to
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   teach us something about
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   Him. And it serves
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   a purpose.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   And so what's
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   missing in that list of reasons?
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   To be
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   complete.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   That's not
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   a reason to be married.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   There's no Jerry Maguire theology here.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   You don't need marriage
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   to be complete.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   Was Jesus complete?
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   I mean, was Jesus
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   not the most complete human being
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   ever to walk the face of the planet?
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   And was He married?
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   No, no, God,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   when He wanted to be fully effective as a human,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   remained single.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Jesus was single.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   Now, I know what you're thinking. You're like, "Yeah, but He was also God."
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   Did the Apostle Paul live
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   a complete life?
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Yeah, he did.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   So did missionaries like Eric Little.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   So did amazing
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   authors like C.S. Lewis.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   People that you've been influenced by.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   So did Mother Teresa.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   Amy Carmichael, who's a missionary
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   in India, opened an orphanage, founded
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   a mission, wrote books that have influenced
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   Corrie Ten Boom, who helped
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   Jews escape the Holocaust, saved lives.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   Katie Davis, still alive today,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   our peers, right? She saved the lives
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   of 13 girls in Uganda.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   Are their lives complete?
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   Are their lives more complete than yours?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   Are their lives more complete than mine?
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   Why? What are they doing?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   What did they do?
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   They used their gift
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   of singleness. They saw it
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   as a gift, not begrudgingly.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   They used it.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   They deployed it. In fact, Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   when he's going to
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   come against the Nazi regime, led
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   by Hitler, and he has
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   to recruit people into a
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   seminary to teach them God's Word,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   you know he strategically went
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   after single people because
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   he knew that married people
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   and those who had families would be
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   distracted from this mission and tied
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   down and unable to accomplish
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   this grand call that God
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   was calling him to.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   He lived a very complete
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   life. Those who served under him lived
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   a very complete life. And so,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   regardless of how you feel,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   you must let God, who created
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   all things, define
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   whether singleness is good or not.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   Marriage serves a purpose.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   Singleness serves a purpose.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Said otherwise, you serve a purpose
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   in marriage. You serve a purpose
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   in singleness.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   That's the gift you have today.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   That's the gift you receive today
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   if you raised your hand earlier.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   I remember when I was growing up,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   when Christmas was coming,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   there was a gift that I really, really
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   wanted. It was a remote-controlled car.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   Like one of those, have you ever seen
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   with the kind of gun remotes and the
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   steering wheel here? You ever seen this?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   And so it was like this car,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   a specific car that I'd seen. It was really fast.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   My buddy had one. All I wanted was
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   this remote-controlled car. And so,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   Christmas rolls around. I'd get up early,
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   as was the routine, wake everyone up
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   to my sibling's demise, and go
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   under the Christmas tree, and we began
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   to rip into presents. And the first one
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   I opened was a hammer. And the second
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   one I opened was this set of
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   screwdrivers. And the next present
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   I opened was this socket wrench set.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   But lo and behold, okay, I got closer
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   and closer to this big square box,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   and I was like, "I know. It's the remote-controlled
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   car." And I opened it up,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   and it was a toolbox.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   Okay? For all the tools I had received.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   And I remember being so discouraged
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   because I wanted some other gift.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   And you know what happened?
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   I eventually got it. I got the car.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   The white remote-controlled car,
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   I remember, it was fast, it was fun.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   I played with it every single day
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   for about a month.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   And then the batteries died at one point.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   I put it on the shelf, never recharged it.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   Sold it in a garage sale several years later.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   And I was like, "I'm going to die."
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   And I was like, "I'm going to die."
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   I put it on the shelf, never recharged it.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   Sold it in a garage sale several years later
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   for about 50 cents.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   You know, I still have those tools.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   Some of the tools I received when I was young
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   at my parents' house, I still have them.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   I still use them.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   I didn't appreciate that they were useful,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   that they were good for something.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   And you know, with the tools, they're work.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   Like, to use them, you have to put in work.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   And I think that an error that people think is,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   "Well, if singleness is work, I must be called to marriage."
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   And then the error that married people make is,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   "Well, if marriage is work, then it must be wrong.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   I'll go back to singleness."
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   Singleness and marriage,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   they're both a lot of work.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   They're both a lot of work.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   They're both gifts.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   And you have one of them today,
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   to use today.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   And one day you will regret
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   not using the gift you have today.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   Because you're sitting there
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   like a kid who didn't receive
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   what he wanted for Christmas,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   and you're looking into the future
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   and say, "What's this for?
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   What's this good for? I want that."
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   And then married people say,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   "What's this good for? I want that."
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   And half of them,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   or more than half of them, go back to that.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   Do you see that?
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   So why does Paul say,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   it is good for them to stay unmarried as I do."
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   And this is what he enters in verse 32-35.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   Let's go.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Commentary on this passage.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   "I would like you to be free from concern," Paul writes.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   "An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   how he can please the Lord.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   But a married man is concerned
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   about the affairs of this world,
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   how he can please his wife.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   And his interests are divided.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   An unmarried woman, or virgin,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   because if she's unmarried
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   it's assumed that she's a virgin in this text,
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   in both body and spirit.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   But a married woman is concerned
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   about the affairs of this world,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   how she can please her husband.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   I am saying this for your own good,
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   not to restrict you, porch,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   but that you may live in right way
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   in undivided devotion to the Lord."
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   Who doesn't want to be married to someone
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   that lives to please them?
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   Who doesn't want to be married
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   to someone that lives to please them?
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   Who doesn't want to be married
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   to someone that lives to please them?
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   Like my hunch is, if you're here
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   and you desire to be married,
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   you want to be married to someone
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   that lives to please you.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   And Paul says that's a distraction
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   to their primary calling, living to please God.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   Them living to please you
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   is a distraction to their primary purpose
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   of living to please God.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   You're a distraction to their ministry.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   Don't find someone who's a distraction
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   to your ministry.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   Find someone who's an asset
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   to your ministry.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   Find someone who helps your ministry.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Find someone who dives in with you
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   and ministers with you
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   in your ministry.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   And so my second point this evening
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   is singleness serves a purpose.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   Singleness serves a purpose.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   It allows for undivided devotion
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   to the Lord.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   That's what Paul writes.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   It allows for undivided devotion
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   to the Lord.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   And so let me just, you know,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   this is where the whole married thing
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   comes in handy.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   This morning
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   I woke up
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   to complete and total chaos.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   And here's what that looks like.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   My son Weston, sick with
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   104 fever at 5.30 this morning.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   He's crying out.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   We get up. She gets up.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   I support her as she gets up.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   And then my little girls come in.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   They're jumping on our bed.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   Then we get up. We begin to make breakfast.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   Monica has to run to the school
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   to take a project that she helped
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   the teacher with. I have to stay there with Weston
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   as I wait to go to work.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   We're making breakfast for them.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   We're doing that whole deal. And the chaos really starts
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   yesterday. I left this place about 6pm.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   And I leave here
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   and I race through traffic to get to
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   Finley's soccer practice. I go to pick her up.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   But first it's a dad scrimmage.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   So we get out of the car, scrimmage the girl.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   Then get back in the car, go pick up some Chinese food
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   on the way home. And then we just
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   begin this race of, "Is homework done?"
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   "You don't have homework yet. You're three."
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   "You need to do the bath time for you."
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   "Can you all take a bath? Go. Other bath. Other shower."
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   "Now you all get in bed. Pajamas. Lotion. You ready?"
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   "Do you have a fever? Oh no. Let's give him some Tylenol."
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   "Now you all get in here. Bedtime. Let's say,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   'Dear God, please protect them and help them sleep.'"
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   "Now prayers with you."
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   "I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   "I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   "Hey babe, I've got to write a porch message for tomorrow."
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   "I have a feeling this is going to make it in there."
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   And so if you feel stressed,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   And so if you feel stressed,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   If you feel stressed,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   If you feel stressed,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   If you feel stressed,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   just wait until you have this little thing that the IRS calls
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   "dependence."
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   Because they're stress multipliers.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   Because they're stress multipliers.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   That's what they do.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   And so let me just keep hitting this home
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   because he's talking about not being distracted
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   and living in full devotion to the Lord.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Do you know that since becoming a Christian,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   Do you know that I've been to Africa,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   I've been to Rwanda, Kigali,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   I've been to Kenya, Nairobi,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   I've been to the Masai Mara,
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   literally the African jungle.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   Do you know that I've been to Brazil
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   three different times.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   Go there in a Manaus, get on a boat,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   travel for days down the Amazon River,
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   get off in the Amazon jungle and begin to share people.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   I've done that three times, separated by months
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   and even years at a time.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   Do you know I've been to Haiti four times.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   Four different times. The island nation of Haiti.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   Fly on a plane, get off the plane, get out
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   and begin to do ministry there.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   Go up into the mountains to tribal people,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   share the gospel. Come down the mountains
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   to the urban people and share the gospel.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   Go into Mission of Hope,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   to the villages, to the orphanage,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   to the hospitals, to the clinic, to the churches,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   to the schools, sharing the gospel.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   Do you know how many times,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   how many international trips
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   I've been on since my son Weston was born?
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   (silence)
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   (silence)
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   If you're listening, that's a zero.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   (laughter)
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   (laughter)
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   He's three years old.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   None.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   None.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   Why?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Because I've got this primary ministry
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   that is now
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   a distraction
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   to those secondary
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   and third ministries.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   I'm distracted.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   My attention, my devotion
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   to the Lord is now divided.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   I have responsibilities.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   I have dependents that require
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   my time, right?
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   Everything begins to change.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   Let me just say this real quick.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   The porch is going to Haiti. If you're here and a member here,
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   there's not a single reason in the world that you shouldn't go.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   When we say
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   unashamed, you need to be
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   the first person in line. If you're here
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   and you live in Dallas and you're single,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   you need to be the first person in line.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   That's using your singleness.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   There's not a
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   single reason in the world
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   you wouldn't go to Haiti with us
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   and experience what God is doing there.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   You'll regret not going, I'll just tell you
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   right now.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   I could go
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   on and on. Sunday,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   I've got to go to the Apple store.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   Alright? I mean,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   torture, right?
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   You go there and you wait for hours.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   I had an appointment and you wait for hours.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   My phone's broken, so I'm like, "I've got to go to the Apple store."
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   Willow Bend. I'm just driving around.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   I'm like, "I need a buddy. You've got to go to the Apple store with a buddy.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   Who wants to sit there alone for hours?"
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   I'm like, "You know what? I'll call Marshall." I can't call Marshall.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   He's got three kids. His wife's not going to let him
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   go on a Sunday. Not because
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   she's mean, but just because he's got
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   responsibility. I'll call Simon. I can't call Simon.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I mean, it would be irresponsible for me
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   to pull him away from his family. I'll call Mike.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   I can't call Mike. Sunday
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   afternoon, they're about to go to lunch,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   they're about to start dinner. I can't call Mike.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   He's about to sit down with his family. I'll call John.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   He's got a baby at the house.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   He's helping his wife with the baby. I can't call John.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   Who do I call? I'm going to go
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   on Twitter and tweet to all my single friends.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   Anybody want to go to the Apple store?
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   You can't just up and leave.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   Do you know that in the past two weeks, and I'm not
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   bragging, okay? I'm just laying this out for you.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   In the past two weeks, I've been invited to go fishing.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   I've been invited to go hunting. I've been invited
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   to go to the beach, and I've been invited to go to Israel.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   In the past
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   two weeks, and I'm like, nope.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   Nope. Nope. You can't just up and
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   leave. I can't just up and go hunting.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   I went fishing, honestly. But I can't just
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   do that, right?
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   I can't just, "Hey, Monica,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   I won't be home for dinner tonight."
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   "No, you're going to stay at home." "Oh, I know. It's a lot going on
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   that whole rat race." "You got that, though.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   I'm going to go hunting.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   I'm going to go to Israel for 10 days."
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   That's cool, right?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   No, I'm sure. Yeah, it's cool, right?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   You can't just do that.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   I can't do that.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   You can do that.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   Only for the season in your life.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   You can go to Haiti.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   You can come up with
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   a thousand reasons not to go and cross them all out.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Say, "You know what? I can go. Why wouldn't I?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   I'm in.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   Why can't I go? I can totally go.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   JP can't go. I can go.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   I might be there."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Here's the
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   punchline.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   Your ministry should be more impactful than mine.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   I'm distracted.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   I've got
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   these three little kids I disciple on a daily basis.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   You can have 30.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   Your ministry,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   according to this text,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   should be so much more
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   impactful than mine, right?
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   And this is
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   why I do what I do.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Right?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   I mean,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   again, I mean this humbly, but
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   to show you my heart. I've been offered
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   jobs, senior pastor
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   jobs.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   I don't want to do that.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   I want to hang out with the
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   most influential, impactful demographic
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   of the church. Give me
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   the single people.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   That's who God's going to use to change
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   the world. That's why I'm here.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   That's why I invested. That's why I'm not going to get
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   to tuck in those three kids tonight.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   Because I want to be with you.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   Telling you
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   not to waste this season
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   of your life. It's a gift,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   man. And it serves
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   a purpose, man.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   You've got to go all in. You've got to
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   wake up and begin to protect yourself
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   from the enemy's distractions
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   to you. Because now's the time
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   to wake up and make a difference
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   and do all the things that God,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   his Holy Spirit has set in your heart
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   that you dream about.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   That you would not be distracted,
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   but focused.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   Say, "God, I'm ready. I'm here.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   Take me."
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   If I could go back and talk
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   to my 21-year-old self,
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   I would beg him to get after it.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Do you know what to teach 1 Corinthians 7?
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   I've got men who are employed
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   by the church who sit over commentaries
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   and come with illustrations and help me.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   I sit over the commentaries myself. I have to
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   learn this text, the cultural context, so that
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   I can sit up here and teach it to you.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   You know when Todd, senior pastor of Watermark,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   when he gets up here, he's just pulling from his 20s.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   He's just giving you
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   stuff he learned when he was 16,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   18, 21 years old.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   If I could go back and talk
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   to my 21-year-old self, I would
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   beg myself, "Hey, get out of the bar.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   Get out of the club. Stop sleeping
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   around. Deal with your porn issue.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   It's time to learn the Bible.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   Write it on your heart.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   Know it.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   Read it every day
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   and do what it says."
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   Now's the time
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   to have full
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   devotion, undivided devotion
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   to the Lord.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   Are you concerned about the affairs
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   of the world or the Lord?
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   Your purpose
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   as a single person is to be fully
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   devoted to the affairs of the Lord,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   Paul writes.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   He says, "I'd like you to be free from
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   concern. With marriage comes real
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   concern." Did Jesus
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   not make this same exact point?
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Because some of you are like, "Well, there's a weird
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   cultural context. It happened in 1 Corinthians
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   7. I've been to seminary."
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Listen, did Jesus not say the same thing in Matthew
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   19? They come to him and they say, "Hey,
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   Rabbi, can we get divorced
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   for any reason?" He says, "No.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   You can't get a divorce. Have you not read
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   that what God has brought together let man not separate?
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   Moses let you get a divorce because your hearts
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   were hardened, but it wasn't so
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   when God invented marriage."
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   The disciples said to him, "If this is
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   the situation between a husband and a wife,
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   if we can't leave her, then
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   it's better not to marry."
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   And Jesus said,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   "Not everyone can accept this word."
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   We know that. "Not everyone can
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   accept this word, but only those
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   to whom it has been given.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   For there are eunuchs."
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   We've got to explain that word.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   Eunuch is where we get the word unicorn.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   No, we don't. I'm just messing with you.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   Eunuch.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   Listen, listen, listen. I'm sorry.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   It's a distraction.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   Sometimes that just happens.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   A eunuch
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   is a single person devoted to celibacy.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   More specifically,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   it's a person who
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   has no reproductive organs.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   It's a male who's been castrated.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   Now, I wrestle
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   with, "Why is that in the Scripture so much?"
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   I believe the Scripture
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   tells us because it's a
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   single person devoted to celibacy.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   Either something
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   has happened to them, they were born a particular way,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   and Jesus is going to give us a third category here.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   This is the category I think very relevant to us.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   You ready?
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   Some eunuchs were born that way.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   Single person
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   devoted to celibacy.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   And there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   by others. Second category.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   And then this is us. Ready?
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   And there are those who choose
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   to live like eunuchs
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   The one who can accept this should accept it.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Did you hear what Jesus just said?
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   There are those who are devoted
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   to celibacy and singleness
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   for the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   Okay, that's cool, Jesus. And then he says something
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   crazy.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   Those who should accept, or who
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   can't accept this
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   should. Do you see what he just did?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   It's like there's
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   married people. That's cool.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   And then there's those who are
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   devoted to singleness and celibacy
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   And that's amazing.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   And you can be that person today.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   Now I'm not talking about for your whole life.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   I don't know what tomorrow holds for you.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   I've got no idea.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   But today you've got the gift.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   So use the gift today.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   Today you have that gift.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   So steward that gift today.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   If your purpose is to glorify God
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   and all that you do, start now
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   because it only gets harder.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Now what's the biggest distraction
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   to living this purpose in singleness?
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   What's the biggest distraction to living this purpose in singleness?
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   Full devotion, Lord.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   I'm going to say it if you don't.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   It's sex.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   You want sex.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   I want to have sex.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   And I've been told that as a single person
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   I'm not supposed to have sex.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   Girls, you might call it companionship.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Like I've heard that
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   a lot of people have a lot of companionship.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   And I've heard that a lot of people have a lot of companionship.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Like I've heard that
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   girls give sex to feel loved.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   Guys give love to get sex.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   But it's sex.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   We want the accompaniment.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   Like you're telling me
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   that I might miss out on this thing
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   that's so important to me
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   called sex.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   Samson didn't miss out on that, right?
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   Got after it.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   Verse 9 says,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   "But if they cannot control themselves,
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   And then the commentary in verse 36.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   You ready?
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   "If anyone is worried that he might not be
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   acting honorable toward the virgin
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   he is engaged to,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   and if his passions are too strong..."
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   This is not a guilt trip at all, okay?
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   This is not a guilt trip at all, okay?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   If you know my story, this is not a guilt trip.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   But if you're engaged to someone,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   it's assumed they're a virgin here in this text.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   And if his passions
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   are too strong and he feels
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   he ought to marry,
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   he should do as he wants.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   He is not sinning. They should get married.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   "But the man who has settled
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   the matter in his own mind,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   and who has made up his mind
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   not to marry the virgin,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   this man also does the right thing.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   So then, he who marries the virgin
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800]   does right, but he who does not marry her
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   does better."
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   What?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   My third
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   final point this evening is singleness and self-control.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Singleness
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   and self-control. See, in the world of singleness,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   your only option for sex is celibacy.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   That means no sex.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   Okay?
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   On Facebook,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   recently, someone stole a picture
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   of my family from Facebook
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   and posted this meme.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   And it says, "This guy,"
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   meaning me, "posts happy
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   family photos on Facebook
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   and tells gay people to live single
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   and celibate lives."
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   This was a person that I was ministering to
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   and I thought we were having a great conversation
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   and we agreed to disagree on some things
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   and I was really hurt by this
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   just because it felt
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   like, you know,
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   I was trying to help him and
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   and then I got to thinking,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   I was like, "Well, it's true."
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   I do tell all single people
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   to live celibate lives.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   Jesus tells all
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   single people to live celibate lives.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   The Apostle Paul tells
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   all people to live celibate lives.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   God, through the Holy Spirit,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   authors the book, the Scriptures, which tells all people
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   to live, all single people, rather,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   to live celibate lives.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   Let me say that in a different way.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.800]   Tells all people to steward well
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   the gifts they've been given for the kingdom.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   That's what it should say.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   This man posts
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   happy pictures of his family
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   on Facebook and tells all people
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   to steward appropriately the gifts
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   that God has entrusted to them for his glory
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   and his good purpose.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   And I do that unashamedly
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   because I know that God,
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   that every good and perfect gift comes from
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   the Father of heavenly lights.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   That God knows you.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   That he's intimately involved
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   in your lives. There's nothing you've done
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   he can't forgive you for. Nothing.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   He delights in forgiving you
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   for the wicked that you've done
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   as you turn to him and say, "I'm going to follow you now."
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   He delights in that.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   Those parties in heaven, it says,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   when that happens.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   There's nothing you've done that he can't forgive you for.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   And he's calling you
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   to follow him right now
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   in self-control,
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   guided by his Holy
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Spirit.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   And he's like, "You want to sell out for sex
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   and miss your purpose?"
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   No way.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Because you thought
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   sex was ultimate? No way.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   Use your singleness
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   strategically to be devoted
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   to the Lord.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   You've got these two options in life.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   You can use your singleness strategically
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   to be devoted to the Lord, or you can make disciples
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   in marriage.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   And he says, "Hey, if you burn with passion, then get
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   married." I love that he says that.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   He gives you your options, very limited.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   He says, "Hey, you want to have sex? Get married."
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   He doesn't say, "Hey, you want to have sex? Masturbate."
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   It's a good way to relieve the stress.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   He said,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   "Hey, you want to have sex? Hey, when you're dating,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   go a little bit too far. Push the line
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.800]   a little bit."
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   No, he gives you two. He gives you one option.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   If you burn with passion, get married.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   It's your only
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   option now. Don't get married before you deal
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   with some of the reasons that you
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   burn with passion.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   If you've helped that fire
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   do pornography and
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   sexual sin.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   Guys,
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   let me tell you something. I think
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   you'll agree with me if you
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   give me a chance. Sex outside of marriage has done
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   more damage to marriage than just about anything
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   I can think of.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   Sex outside of marriage has done
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   more damage to marriage than anything I can think
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   of. And here's why. Because
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   you've got to think about this. God invented sex.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   He made the parts. He made them
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   function the way they do. It's his brilliant invention.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   It's like him and Jesus and the Holy Spirit
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   were sitting around like, "Hey, we want to bring babies.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   How can we do that?" Holy Spirit's like,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   "I don't know, man. They could
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   say this word and babies could come."
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   He's like, "No, man. Let's make it more intimate than that."
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   "Oh, I know. We'll take
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   that and make that and make those
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   work together like that and babies will be born."
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   "Oh, that's genius, Jesus.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   That's what we'll do."
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   And he invented sex. I'm telling you
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   it was something like that. I don't even know. It's not in the
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   Bible, but it was something like that.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   He invented sex.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   And it serves a purpose.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Procreation. And it brings a
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   husband and a wife together in a way where
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   they have to act selfless toward one another
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   in order to do that because sex when
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   you're fighting is not fun regardless and
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   contrary to what you've heard, two people
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   that hate each other don't have great sex.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   You have to love
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   each other in order to come together in that very
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   intimate act.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   So what happens
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   if you've been having sex whenever you feel
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   like it by yourself?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   You get in marriage and you are
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   selfish as all get out and you think
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   it's just going to be there whenever you want, but that's
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   not how it works. The female body
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   has to be loved and cherished
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   and cared for to open up in that way.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   And so
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   you get there and you're like, "I want sex." She's like, "I don't care what you
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   want, okay? I hate you." And you're like, "Oh,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   man, that's unfortunate."
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   And so right?
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   And you're like, "Well, that's crazy, JP. That doesn't happen."
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Oh, does it not happen most of the time?
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   Like, do you think those divorces
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   they just happen? Like one day everything's amazing,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   wild, crazy, monkey sex from the chandeliers
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.800]   and they're like, "I don't think I love you anymore."
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   No, no, no, man. Those divorces represent
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   long seasons of celibacy
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   in marriage, which is much more difficult
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   than celibacy in singleness.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   You tracking with me?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Divorces represent
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   long seasons
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   of celibacy in marriage.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   That's celibacy with someone of the
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   opposite sex naked lying next to you.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   Celibacy. That's really
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   difficult celibacy.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   You tracking with me?
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   You guys following? Don't think too hard about it, okay?
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   Just nod
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   your head in agreement.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   And so do you see God's
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   genius design? He's like, "Hey, you're gonna have to
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   act unselfish toward one another
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   or unselfish rather toward
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   one another so that you can come together in
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   that act. And if you take that act out of what
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   it was meant to be, you learn selfishness,
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   a pattern of selfishness,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   which ruins your marriage long before your
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   marriage ever comes into
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   existence.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Why do you think marriage decline
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   is directly related to people having
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   sex outside of marriage?
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Sex outside of marriage goes
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   up, marriage goes down.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   Sex outside of marriage
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   stays down, marriage goes up.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   See the video we saw last week.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   Tell me God's
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   not brilliant.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Tell me he's not so much smarter
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   than we are.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   And then there's this topic, and I'll
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   just hit this briefly, of sanctification.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   See,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   in marriage you're sanctified through learning
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   to get along.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   In singleness you're sanctified through
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   celibacy, learning
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   to control your desires,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   yielding them to God. You're sanctified.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   You are made more like God
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   by learning to control
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   your desires.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   So to honor God as a single
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   person, you need to know three things about sex.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   One, it's a distraction
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   to his purpose for your life.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Two, it is absolutely
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   not ultimate.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   No one in the history of history
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   has ever died because they haven't
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   had sex. What happened
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   to Mary? She was a
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   virgin, man. Just went.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   Never happened.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   And three,
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   it's not an option for you.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   Let's take that
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   option, remove it from the table.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   Maybe an option later for you
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   in marriage, not an option for you in singleness.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   It's
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   not an option.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   And so if you have sinned in that way, you can be
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   forgiven, but make
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   sure you remove the temptations.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   And use
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   this gift of singleness to get well.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   Okay, I'm gonna give you five things
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   and we're gonna end. Five ways
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   to use this gift of singleness.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   You ready? Number one,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   if you've sinned,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   I'm sorry, heal rather
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   from hurts and habitual
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   sin. And
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   I'm just gonna add one. Ready? Just flat
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   out weirdness, okay?
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   You guys try to be like, if you don't know how to
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.800]   pick up your clothes or like do the dishes
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   or you have these weird idiosyncrasies
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   that people don't want to tell you about,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   would you take some time to heal from that?
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Okay, like listen to them
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   say, "Hey, help me. I
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   need help in growing up." And they'll help you
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   so that you don't pull someone down
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   in the act of marriage. So take time
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   to heal from hurts and habitual sin.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   Number two, learn how to love.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   And so if every relationship
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   in your rearview mirror has crashed and
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   burned, you don't know how to
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   love. Learn how. Get a
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.800]   roommate. The dysfunctions of two
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   roommates trying to get a same-sex roommate
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   and the dysfunction of those people trying to live
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   together because they'll tell you, "Hey, pick up your clothes.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   Do the dishes. Help out
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.800]   every now and then." Or they'll just ignore you for months
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.800]   at a time, right? But whatever that is, that
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   working through that dysfunction will
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   help you. I am firmly in the
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   camp that no single people should live alone,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   okay? I'm firmly in that camp.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   Alright? I remember Monica and I, right
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   after we got married, we went
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   through this deal called Homebuilders Group
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   and they began to instruct us on conflict
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   resolution and I was like, "Man,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.800]   I wish I would have known that
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   with my roommate. We wouldn't have fought so
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   much. I wish I would have learned how to communicate
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   in that way. I wish I would have learned those skills
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   and tactics, right, and strategies
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   before I got married as a single
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   person, right?"
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   Number three, serve.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   All in, man.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   What are your dreams to change the world?
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   What is preventing you?
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   Gosh, what is preventing
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   you from changing the world and
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   fulfilling those dreams right now?
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   Do something crazy
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   or just be faithful.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Four, be a disciple.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   Find someone
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   older than you or smarter than you
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   or both that knows
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   one more Bible verse than you do or whatever that
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   is and say, "Hey, will you teach me the
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   Scripture?"
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   And fifth,
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   disciple someone. Find someone
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   who you know at least one more
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   Bible verse than they do and teach them
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   the Scripture. Spend
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   time with them, explaining
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   God's Word to them. And so in
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   summary, singleness is a gift.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   Be strategically single.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   Live out your purpose, single or
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   married.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   And sex is not available
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   to single people.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   Just as I
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   wrap up, I just want to say this, that
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   I know there's girls
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   that have been
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   here that
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   have dreamed of getting married since
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   you were four years old.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   [silence]
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   And I get it.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   I got two
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   girls at home, six and eight.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   Finley came home yesterday
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   singing that, you know,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   Finley and whoever
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   She actually goes, "Daddy, does K-I-S-S-I-N-G
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   spell kissing?" I knew
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   where she was going with this.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   And I just get, I feel the
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   pressures on the world, of the world
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   from her at six years old to get
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   married.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   Like, this is crazy.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   And so I know that
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   some of you have felt
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   these pressures since you were four years old
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   to get married.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   And there's this, it has to
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   be running through your mind right about now, like this
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   whole message, maybe you tuned me out one time, you're like, "Hey, JP,
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   you know, it's not exactly up to me.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   Like, I'd love to move from this life
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   stage to that life stage, and I'm
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   thinking about that, and I'm looking at this gift, it doesn't feel like
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   a gift, I want that gift, and I don't
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   even know if that's ever going to happen to me."
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   Guys,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   here's what I know, man. You're here
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   this long, and
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   then you go somewhere, and I want to show you something
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   that God says
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   to people who were single
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   and celibate and used their
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   celibacy for the kingdom of God. You know, He says
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   this in Isaiah 56,
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   verse 5, He says this,
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   "For this is what the Lord says to
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   those who have lived celibate lives,
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   who keep my sabbaths,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   who choose what pleases me,
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   and hold fast to my covenant.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Listen to them.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   I will give
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   within my temple and its walls a
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   memorial and a name better than
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   sons and daughters.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   I will give them an everlasting name
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   that will endure forever."
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   You want, you're like, "I was born to be a mom,
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   JP." Do you think God
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   doesn't know you were born to be a mom?
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   He says, "Hey,
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   I will give you one day much sooner than you
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   think something more valuable
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   than sons and daughters.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   Forever and
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   ever and ever." There's no family
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   up there, you know that? The only family
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   in heaven is the family of Christ.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   This is who my brothers
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   and sisters are. Remember, they come to Jesus,
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   "Hey, your mom's here." What are you talking about? This is who my mom
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   is. There's no family up there.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   There's no, there's no husbands
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   and wives up there. I'm going to get
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   there and Monica is going to be a friend
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   to me. I mean, it's crazy
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   to think about
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   because in the kingdom, he reprioritizes
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   everything.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   And he says it's about us
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   and the family of God and him.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   And I just,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   I want to tell you this. Friday,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   Friday was our
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   wedding anniversary. We've been married 11
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   years. 11 years, man.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   [Applause]
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   It's crazy. Over
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   a decade, these
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   three kids, it's like
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   sometimes I feel like I'm playing house, you know?
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Like I have no idea what I'm doing, but
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   just figuring it out as I go along.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   And whenever you cross a
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   boundary like that, a mile marker, like an anniversary,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   you sit back and you reflect.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   We look back on the 11 years.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   It's been a crazy 11 years. And honestly,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   it's gone up and to the right, man.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   It's cliche,
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   but I wrote in her card, I said, "I know it's
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   cliche, but this has been
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   the best year ever."
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   She's changed so much. I've
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   changed so much. She's become
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   the godliest woman I know. I'm not just saying
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   that up here. I mean, it's true. I really, I
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   thank God for that when I'm all by myself.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   I mean, her
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   body's changed. She has this scar
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   right here, big scar
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   where three children were
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   cut out of her. I love that scar.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   And everything it
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   represents.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   I love her so much. But as we
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   reflect on the past 11 years,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   we looked at our biggest regrets.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   We said the same
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   thing. There weren't in the past 11 years.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   There were the 11 years
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   before the 11 years.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   We were both so
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   grieved
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   by how
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   we wasted
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   those seasons of our life, by how
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   we stewarded something
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   that God said was a gift.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   And we used that gift for our own selfish
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   pleasures and desires. We created
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   habits in our lives that did not go
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   away easily.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   I mean, they have taken
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   11 years
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   of faithful
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   sanctification in the work of
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   the Holy Spirit
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   to learn to live with each other in a
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   selfless way.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   And so this is
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   why I've given my life
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   to this ministry. I don't
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   want to do anything else. There's
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   nowhere I'd rather be than
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   right here in front of you
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   begging you to
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   stop playing games and
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   wasting your singleness.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   You don't lose
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   if you remain single.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   You lose if you waste
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   your singleness.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   There's no
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   better time
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   than to create a
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   place that Jesus would
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   return to with every
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   gift and every talent
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   and every dollar
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   and every possession
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   and every relationship
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   and every occupation
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   and every training and every
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   skill set and anything
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   that you've received along the way.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.800]   There's no
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   better time to take all of
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   that and say, "Here you go, God.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   Let's go.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   I'm not waiting for something
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   else.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   What do you want to do with me? Where do you want
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   to send me? How do you want
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   to use me? Who do you want me
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   to share with? Who do you want me to pour
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   into? Who can pour into me, God,
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   to make me a more effective warrior for you?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   God, if
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   you bring someone into my life
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   to live out my purpose with, praise
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   be to you. And if you don't, I will
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   live in full devotion
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   to you until I die.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   Until I
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   leave this place. If I'm
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   80 years old,
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   90 years old,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   100 years old,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   I will serve you with
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   every minute you give me
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   in full devotion
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   to live out my purpose, to
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   glorify you
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   in everything I do. What else are you going to do, guys?
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   What else
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   are you going to do? Get rich?
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   Explore
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   some pleasures that you know you
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   feel guilty of five seconds afterwards?
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   You're going to get drunk again?
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   You're going to keep
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   partying? Snort
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   another line? Slam
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   another shot? What are you
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   going to do, man?
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   You're going to keep playing games? You're going to keep
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   wasting your life?
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   Are you
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   going to go in?
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   Go all in?
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   Father,
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   I don't know how
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   much time we have,
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   but
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   would you take whatever it is?
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   And, Father,
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   would you use it for your good purpose?
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   Father, would you
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   use it for your glory?
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   God, would you help us to see that
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   whatever you've entrusted to us for whatever
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   season you've entrusted it to us
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   for, would you help us to see it as a
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   gift, Lord? Would you
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   give us hearts of gratitude
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   that we would deploy those gifts as
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   others, the great cloud of witnesses who
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   have gone before us and deployed those gifts
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   so well?
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   God, would you help us to use whatever
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   talents you've entrusted to us? If it's
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   two talents, if it's five talents,
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.800]   if it's ten talents, God, help us to see
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   it and multiply it, double it.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   God, would you change the world through my
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   single friends in this room? Every hand
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   that went in the air, God, I pray
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   that they would lose the mindset that
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   they're in a waiting room, a holding tank,
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   waiting for something, some other
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   season to be effective, that they would see
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   today, God, please help them see today
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   as their most effective
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   days of ministry, that
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.800]   they would give their lives back to you and
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   say, "Here I am, Lord, use me."
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   Father, you are our shepherd
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.800]   and we are your sheep.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   Would you guide
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   and lead us according
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   to your good purpose?
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   If you're here and you feel like you're
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   single and forgotten,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   or maybe you're here and you
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.800]   look back and you see all this sexual sin,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   this like stuff, you know that you're like
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   the woman at the well who's like, "Hey, that's not
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   my husband." He's like, "You're right, you've had five husbands
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   and this guy's not your husband."
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Or you're here and you've lost someone,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   maybe you went through a breakup recently
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   and you feel so alone in that,
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.800]   you're going to love Jesus.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   Jesus always moved towards
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   those people,
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   the widow,
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   the survivor
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   of someone in the grave,
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   the woman at the well,
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   the
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   prostitute.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   Jesus always moved towards
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.800]   those people. He always offered
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   those people fulfillment,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   completeness,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   purpose.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   Purpose.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   And so, He doesn't
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   want your scraps.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   He doesn't want
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   this thing that you've
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   added to your life, this accessory
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   called Christianity.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   He doesn't want you to call yourself a Christian
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   by a cross on your neck or
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   entitle. He wants your everything.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   Full devotion.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   He wants you talking to Him when you're
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   all by yourself and no one can see you
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.800]   talking to Him, so you're not at all tempted
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   to be prideful in what you might pray, even out loud.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   But when you're in your
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   closet,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   when you're by yourself in your room,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   you would go to Him and you'd beg Him and you'd
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.800]   plead with Him. And you'd pursue
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   a relationship with Him
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   harder and faster and
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   more than you've ever pursued a
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   relationship with anyone.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   Because everything wrong
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.800]   you've done, He paid for.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   On the cross, He literally
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   wiped your slate
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   clean, so that when God looks at you,
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   He's no longer counting your sins
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   against you, because He understands
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   they've been paid for through Christ. His death
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   and resurrection is forgiveness for your
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   sins.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   If we can help clarify that, or simply
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   pray with you that you would believe that
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   there's going to be red shirts all over this
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   place,
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   that would love the opportunity to do that.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.800]   If you don't know what full devotion
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   looks like for you,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   red shirts all over this place.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   If you want to go to Haiti with us, you go to that Welcome Center,
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   you write down, "I want to go to Haiti."
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   Your email, and we'll follow up with you.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.800]   We're going to take about 100, 150
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   people of you, 150 of you
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   with us to Haiti.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   We're just going to do more in Dallas of what we do
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   there. We're going to
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   change the freaking world for the cause of
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   Christ. That's what we're going to do. Go in peace, to love,
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   and serve the Lord.
