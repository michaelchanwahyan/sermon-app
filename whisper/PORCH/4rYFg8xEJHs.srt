1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,340
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:19,140
 - All right, let's go.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,060
 Welcome, friends, in the room in Dallas.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,080
 Those who braved all the crazy traffic

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,180
 in the last couple days, and friends in El Paso,

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,180
 Fayetteville, Phoenix, Austin, Houston, go Strohs,

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,200
 and wherever you are joining and listening in.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
 As we continue this series, Ready to Offer Romance,

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,080
 I'm gonna start by telling a little bit of a story.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,320
 A couple years ago, went to the doctor

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
 for my annual physical,

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,840
 and which is always an interesting experience,

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,880
 and got there and had that experience

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,640
 where the doctor tells you, hey, step on the scale,

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,500
 we're just gonna check, and it's kinda that moment of truth,

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,160
 and you step up there, and it was like a scene

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,560
 from Heavyweights came back, because he was like,

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,600
 step on the scale, okay, wait, step on the scale,

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,040
 step back on the scale here for just a second,

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,000
 and he looked at the number,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,320
 and then he looked down at his paper,

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,400
 and he goes, you know, the last two times you've come in,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
 you've put on like 10 pounds each time,

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,400
 let's talk about your weight.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,980
 It's like, let's talk about your weight.

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,840
 It's called muscle, is what it is,

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,200
 and it was not at all the case,

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
 and it was one of those scenarios where he was like,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,960
 hey, you know, tell me, exercise, and what are you doing,

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
 and it's like, look, dude, we got little kids,

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
 it's a little hard to find time to exercise right now,

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,280
 I just prefer wearing bigger shirts,

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,140
 and so that's my offense right now,

35
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,120
 and he began to walk through, you know,

36
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,060
 it's important to stay in shape and get in shape,

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,640
 so that led me to like, man, I need to get back in shape

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,160
 and begin to do that, and there's that experience

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,560
 where if you have been out of shape before,

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,880
 probably you have, you go back into the gym,

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,640
 or you go back to running or doing things

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,240
 that you've done before, and what seemed at some point

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 in the past to be easy, and you could lift that weight,

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,960
 or you could, you know, run a mile,

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,920
 all of a sudden becomes like, oh my gosh,

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,320
 what has happened to me, how did I get so out of shape?

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,840
 And the answer, for all of us, is pretty elementary

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
 or pretty simple, right, like if someone came up to you

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
 and they were like, hey, I got out of shape,

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,320
 I don't know how, you would say,

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,820
 well, have you been exercising, have you been eating,

52
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,480
 you would immediately connect the dots,

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,800
 there's no mystery in your mind,

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
 or mystery in any of our minds,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,040
 anytime we find ourselves no longer in shape,

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,440
 and the reason I start there is tonight,

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
 we are continuing this look at Song of Solomon

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,800
 as it relates to the idea of love and romance

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
 and everything that God has to say,

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,520
 and we have an expression as it relates to love

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,160
 that someone will fall in love with another person,

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,420
 and there's also an increasingly popular expression

63
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,720
 that people will cite even as a reason for divorce

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,560
 that I fell out of love, I'm no longer in love.

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,500
 What does that have to do with in shape and all that?

66
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,040
 Well, in the same way that I would say,

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,620
 hey, I'm not in shape, you would say,

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,920
 well, I know how that happened, or how you got there,

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,960
 and how you get back in shape,

70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,440
 and yet people don't make the same connection

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,040
 when it comes to love.

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,500
 When someone says, hey, we were in love and we were married,

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,160
 and then they end up saying,

74
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,760
 you know, we're just not in love anymore,

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,480
 most of us don't connect the dots

76
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,600
 that just like being in shape,

77
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,640
 you do certain things to stay in shape,

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,880
 there are certain things biblically,

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,880
 it says you do to stay in love.

80
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,820
 That just like, in that scenario,

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,180
 you would exercise and you eat right,

82
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,280
 and that's where you do in shape.

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
 The Bible says there are things

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,920
 that you don't just stay in love and neutral,

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,540
 there are things that you do to stay in love.

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
 It is easy to fall in love,

87
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,660
 all you gotta have is a pulse, a pulse and a person.

88
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,840
 You got it, you can fall in love.

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,260
 But it takes certain things in order to stay in love,

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,180
 and I know in the room, you're like,

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,820
 that's crazy right now, not us, baby,

92
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,860
 we're gonna be in love for whatever,

93
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,920
 no matter what happens, we got this.

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,120
 No, you don't, and there are certain things

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,940
 that are characteristics that you need to know,

96
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,020
 but here's what the world will tell you.

97
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,080
 They're like, hey, if you fell out of love,

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,620
 you probably were never in real love to begin with.

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,880
 And it is not true.

100
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,740
 Generally, almost every scenario,

101
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,180
 in fact, not I mean almost, every scenario

102
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,220
 where someone says we were in love,

103
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,820
 and 50% of marriages are this way.

104
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,100
 Like people generally don't just go like,

105
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,460
 hey, we're getting married on a whim,

106
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
 she was there, and I was like,

107
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,020
 hey, what are you doing, let's get married.

108
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,380
 They generally get married when they're like,

109
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,140
 man, I love this person, and then in a short time later,

110
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,800
 they're standing in front of the person

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,020
 sometimes they've had children with,

112
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,760
 and they say, I don't love you,

113
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,180
 I don't want any part of you in my life.

114
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,460
 And I had fallen in love, but I'm no longer in love with you,

115
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,260
 but most of us don't connect the dots

116
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,320
 that there are certain reasons why that is the case.

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,620
 So tonight, we're gonna explore

118
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,980
 the more difficult of the two.

119
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,740
 Falling in love is easy.

120
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,780
 Staying in love requires certain things,

121
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,100
 and biblically, there are things

122
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,340
 that we're given all throughout the Bible,

123
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,860
 but specifically in Song of Solomon,

124
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,160
 which is the book that we've been in,

125
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,700
 there are things that are laid out

126
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,340
 that are a part of if you're gonna have

127
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,860
 a love story that lasts, we'll be there.

128
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,180
 So if you take notes, you can just write out,

129
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,060
 hey, staying in love, here's three things

130
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,200
 that are involved every time a relationship stays in love.

131
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,080
 So I don't know if you're dating, if you're engaged,

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,980
 if you're married, wherever you are in the room,

133
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,040
 if you hope to have a relationship that lasts someday,

134
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,780
 these are things that are going to be a part

135
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,820
 of any healthy marriage, regardless, really,

136
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,700
 even of what you believe in terms of faith,

137
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,140
 though that's probably, not even probably,

138
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,620
 is more important than any marriage you're gonna have.

139
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,260
 But if you're gonna have any type of relationship

140
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,840
 and love that lasts, these are going to be

141
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
 a part of each of them.

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,580
 So here's what we're gonna do.

143
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,020
 I'm gonna start in chapter six, verse 13 of Song of Solomon,

144
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,860
 and we're gonna read through the text,

145
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,880
 and then I'm gonna give three takeaways.

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,460
 Song of Solomon, if you're just joining us,

147
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,940
 rated R for romance, is because, we named it that

148
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,600
 because this series, unlike maybe any series we've ever done

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,140
 is a look at a book that is very rated R.

150
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,360
 What do I mean by that, why do I say that?

151
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,520
 The book of Song of Solomon was so erotic

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,920
 that young Hebrew boys and girls were not allowed

153
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,480
 to read the book until they were 30 or married.

154
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,960
 Think about that.

155
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,840
 If you're under the age of 30, and you're an Orthodox Jew

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,600
 still, and you're not married, you can't read it.

157
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,520
 This means in Solomon's day, when people were like,

158
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
 and they weren't sneaking in Playboy,

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
 they're like pulling in Song of Solomon

160
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,880
 as a teenager into their tent while they're living there.

161
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,420
 They're like, dude, oh my gosh.

162
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,460
 And you may have come in thinking,

163
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,980
 man, God is not about sexuality,

164
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,380
 he's not about intimacy in marriage,

165
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,080
 he's not about romance, God invented all of that,

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,220
 and he is very pro that.

167
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,960
 So we've been exploring that inside of this book,

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,560
 but he's for that in the context of marriage.

169
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,520
 So far, to catch you up, we looked at chapters one through

170
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,320
 six, where we saw the attraction stage,

171
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,300
 then we saw the dating, or kind of the courtship,

172
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,280
 as they're getting to know each other,

173
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,380
 and moving towards marriage.

174
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,960
 Then we saw engagement, and the honeymoon night,

175
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,520
 and it was steamy, and then we moved into conflict,

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
 which is a part of any healthy relationship.

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,600
 And tonight, we are going to explore what it looks like

178
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,660
 to stay in love.

179
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,340
 Let me just preface this, if there by chance are any

180
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,160
 children here, which there shouldn't be,

181
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,800
 but if there are, this would be a good time to go get

182
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,600
 a snow cone or something, because this chapter

183
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,200
 has been named by scholars the most erotic section,

184
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,020
 not just in this book, but in all of the Bible.

185
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,140
 So it is about to get real, people.

186
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,360
 And I will start in verse 13, and you'll see exactly

187
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,280
 kind of what I mean by that, and we'll read through

188
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,180
 the exchange that these two people have

189
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,100
 in this relationship.

190
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,300
 One last thing, in case again you are joining us,

191
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,740
 Song of Solomon is a song between a guy and a girl,

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,260
 and they kind of go back and forth between one another.

193
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,340
 Every now and then, like their friends chime in,

194
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,100
 but think Romeo and Juliet, if you will,

195
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,880
 as they just sing back and forth to one another.

196
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,640
 So verse 13, the guy speaking says this.

197
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,740
 Turn, O turn, to his lady, O perfect one.

198
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,140
 This is after they're married, after a little bit of time

199
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,440
 has gone by and they're no longer newlyweds,

200
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
 and they're just continuing to deepen in relationship.

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,520
 This section we're looking at, he starts with him saying,

202
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,120
 hey turn, turn, O perfect one, turn that I may stare at you.

203
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,680
 Not a great pickup line, gentlemen, for a girl

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,500
 that you're just meeting, but appropriate in marriage.

205
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,020
 So he's like, hey girl, let me look at you.

206
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,460
 Girl, you are so fine, that's where he's beginning.

207
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,560
 Verse, or the next verse, she says,

208
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,240
 why do you gaze upon the perfect one

209
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,580
 like the dance of Mahanayn?

210
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,560
 Mahanayn, virtually every theologian studying this week

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
 says that she is now, the dance of Maharayn

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,040
 is something that she is now engaging in

213
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,480
 where she is dancing seductively before her husband.

214
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
 This is like a strip tease, if you will,

215
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,240
 that she is doing, or at least a naked dance

216
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
 in front of her husband, and he's about to praise

217
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,320
 all of her body, way before, that's what the next verses are

218
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,220
 of him laying out, you got this, and girl, you got this.

219
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,800
 Way before John Mayer came over with your body

220
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
 as a wonderland, Solomon was going,

221
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,640
 hey, I love the way your hair falls to your hips.

222
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 And here's what he says, verse one,

223
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,400
 as she dances in front of him,

224
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,640
 how beautiful are your feet, your sandaled feet,

225
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,300
 O nobleman's daughter.

226
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,920
 The curves of your thighs, or your hips,

227
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,680
 your translation may have, are like jewels.

228
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,160
 The work and the hands of a master craftsman.

229
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,220
 Girl, I like your legs and your hips, Shakira, Shakira.

230
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,100
 Your navel is a round mixing bowl,

231
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,720
 may it never lack mixed wine.

232
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,100
 This word navel is translated in one of two ways.

233
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,560
 Either belly button, which most scholars don't think

234
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,480
 makes sense because he talks about her belly next,

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,720
 or her vagina, and virtually every scholar that I read

236
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,000
 said that's what he is saying here.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
 Let's keep moving.

238
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,520
 Okay, your belly is like a mound of wheat

239
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,160
 encircled by the lilies.

240
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,120
 Not always the best compliment to give a lady.

241
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,440
 You know, you've got a wheat belly, that's what you got.

242
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,920
 Here's what he's saying, he's likely talking

243
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,760
 about the color of it, like wheat would be bound together

244
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,120
 in the shape and the color of it,

245
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,080
 and he's saying it's like this bronze-tanned stomach

246
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,840
 that smells good, encircled by lilies.

247
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,640
 Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,160
 Your neck is like a tower made of ivory, this slender neck.

249
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,540
 Your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon,

250
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,960
 by the gate of Bath Ruben.

251
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,920
 Heshbon was just a city known for its beautiful

252
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,800
 and calm pools.

253
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,360
 Your nose is like the Tower of Lebanon overlooking Damascus.

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,000
 Again, probably not the compliment that I would give,

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,880
 but dude, Solomon's a nose guy, man.

256
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,160
 Okay, your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,

257
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,740
 which was the most beautiful place

258
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,440
 that sat atop all of Palestine.

259
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,340
 Your locks of your hair, or the locks of your hair

260
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,240
 are like royal tapestries.

261
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,300
 The king is held captive in its tresses.

262
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,180
 How beautiful you are, how lovely, oh love,

263
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,700
 with all of your delights.

264
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,400
 Your stature is like a palm tree,

265
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,020
 and your breasts are like clusters of grapes.

266
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,060
 I want to-- (audience laughing)

267
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,900
 I want to climb that palm tree

268
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,700
 and take hold of its fruit stalks.

269
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,720
 I don't know if I even need to explain that verse.

270
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,200
 May your breasts be like the clusters of grapes

271
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,900
 and the fragrance of your breath.

272
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,180
 Be like apricots.

273
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,580
 May your mouth be like the fine or best wine

274
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,220
 flowing smoothly for my beloved,

275
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,340
 gliding gently over our lips as we sleep

276
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,820
 or make love together.

277
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,060
 So he goes through, he praises her from her feet

278
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,820
 to her head, head, shoulders, knees, and toes.

279
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,660
 These are all the things that I love about you,

280
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,420
 and he just praises her as she dances seductively

281
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,540
 in front of him.

282
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,220
 And in response, she said, "I and my beloveds

283
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,940
 "and his desire, and he desires me."

284
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,900
 The word desire, you may feel like,

285
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,800
 oh, she said that before.

286
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,780
 That is the only time, other than in Genesis chapter three,

287
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,060
 that word is used in all of the Bible.

288
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,900
 The other time it was used was with Cain,

289
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,020
 if you know the story of Cain and Abel,

290
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,240
 and God shows up to Cain and basically is like,

291
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,720
 hey, sin's desire is to consume you.

292
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,280
 And she uses that word here and says,

293
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,060
 hey, I and my husbands, and dude, there is no mistaking,

294
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,500
 this man, he loves his lady,

295
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,180
 and he wants to be all up in this

296
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,820
 and climb that palm tree.

297
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,540
 So she's just a confidence security

298
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
 as they move intimately towards one another,

299
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,500
 and they're making love together.

300
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,180
 And then we're told a scene happens shortly after that.

301
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,620
 The next scene is of them sitting in the palace,

302
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,460
 and the wife basically saying,

303
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,160
 hey, here's what I wanna do.

304
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,700
 I've planned a getaway.

305
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,980
 So next scene, verse 11.

306
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
 Come, my beloved.

307
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,940
 Let us go to the countryside

308
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,340
 and let us spend the night in the villages.

309
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,060
 Let's go out to a bed and breakfast.

310
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,360
 Let's get away from all the hustle and bustle of town

311
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,220
 and all the work and all the responsibilities.

312
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,740
 Let's go away from the city.

313
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,580
 Let us rise early in the morning and go to the vineyards

314
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
 and see if the vines have budded,

315
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
 see if their blossoms have opened,

316
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,780
 and if the pomegranates are in bloom.

317
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,060
 There I will give you my love.

318
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,520
 So she further uses euphemism and says,

319
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,620
 hey, let's get out of the city

320
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,340
 and let's go make love in the outdoors.

321
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,660
 Verse 13, the mandrakes send out their fragrance.

322
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,740
 Over our door is every delicacy, both new and old.

323
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,760
 Here's what mandrakes was.

324
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,420
 Mandrakes was an aphrodisiac inside the Bible.

325
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,100
 And so there's another occasion where in the Bible,

326
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,500
 there's these two women who fight over giving mandrakes,

327
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,200
 Rachel and Leah, to Jacob,

328
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,940
 because they knew it was a form of arousal,

329
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,900
 it was associated with that.

330
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,440
 There was a belief that in eating them,

331
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,500
 it would just be arousing.

332
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,840
 So basically what she's saying is like,

333
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,620
 hey, let's get out of town.

334
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,820
 I'm gonna put on Usher, whatever song you want, boo.

335
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,060
 And the mood is set, the candles have been lit,

336
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,620
 the mandrakes are in season.

337
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,620
 And over our door is every delicacy, both new and old,

338
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,680
 which I have stored up for you, my lover.

339
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,980
 So she says, let's get out, let's make love.

340
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,540
 And I got some old things I know you like,

341
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,300
 and I got some new things we're gonna try out.

342
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,800
 Now you know why it's been called

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,380
 the most erotic section in the Bible.

344
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,060
 Verse one of chapter eight,

345
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,740
 where Nin told of the next scene,

346
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,260
 where she's just reflecting on her husband.

347
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,100
 It says this,

348
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,020
 oh, how I wish you were my little brother.

349
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
 She feels like a curve ball, left turn.

350
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,900
 Nursing at my mother's breasts,

351
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,940
 which doesn't make it any better.

352
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,180
 If I saw you outside, I could kiss you,

353
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,820
 and surely no one would despise me.

354
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,640
 What is she saying there?

355
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,660
 Hey, basically she's saying in this time in Israel,

356
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,300
 it was inappropriate for a husband and wife

357
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,980
 to show public displays of affection.

358
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
 That if you were out in the open,

359
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,600
 you were not to kiss the person you're married to.

360
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
 That seems bizarre to us.

361
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,060
 It was a cultural thing at that time,

362
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,780
 but it would be appropriate to kiss someone

363
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,020
 of your own family, or to kiss a sibling that was around you.

364
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,500
 She's basically saying, man, I wish that you were my brother

365
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,540
 so that at any point I could display affection to you.

366
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,900
 The social norms of what is appropriate

367
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,100
 are too constraining for me and how much I love you,

368
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,820
 would be another way of saying that.

369
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,460
 Verse two, I would lead you into my mother's house,

370
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,760
 the one who taught me.

371
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,580
 There I would give you spiced wine to drink

372
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,220
 and the nectar of my pomegranates, talking about sex.

373
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,600
 His left hand caresses my head,

374
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,260
 his right hand stimulates me.

375
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,660
 It is hot and heavy, and then she takes this turn

376
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,820
 as though she's very intentionally bringing up something

377
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,180
 she said three different times in the book.

378
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,660
 I admonish you, oh maidens of Jerusalem,

379
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,500
 or unmarried women, do not arouse or awaken love

380
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,340
 until it pleases.

381
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,340
 So everything's like, I mean, clearly,

382
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,540
 they're passionate, exchange, sexual intimacy

383
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,220
 is taking place in the midst of all of that.

384
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,140
 It's as though she pauses and go, hey,

385
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,700
 do not introduce sex or intimacy and passion

386
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,540
 until the right time, until marriage.

387
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,980
 Despite all of the freedom that they show together

388
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,200
 with one another in their relationship,

389
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,980
 it's as though she pauses and it's like, this is amazing.

390
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,700
 Don't introduce it until you get married.

391
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,980
 This is a couple that prioritizes one another.

392
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,140
 They pursue each other sexually.

393
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,620
 They do all types of things, and three takeaways

394
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,980
 that I wanna look at from their relationship

395
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,380
 just really quickly as it looks like,

396
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,820
 or as it relates to staying in love.

397
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,820
 How did they keep the romance and the fire of their love

398
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,240
 burning hot when it likely was years later

399
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,260
 that this relationship, or they're reflecting

400
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
 on their time together?

401
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,740
 They're not newlyweds at this point.

402
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,140
 And so there's three takeaways that would be a part

403
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,020
 of any relationship that are always involved

404
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,140
 in love that lasts, or in staying in love,

405
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,860
 not falling in love, and staying in love.

406
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 The first one is this.

407
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,620
 Staying in love always involves work.

408
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,500
 It always involves work.

409
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,300
 The reason this is so important is there is this myth

410
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,540
 out there, and I know most of you on the surface,

411
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,080
 you're like, oh, no, I wouldn't believe that.

412
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,920
 That's crazy.

413
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,700
 And many of you have bought it that if I can just find

414
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,320
 the right person, if I just find the one out there,

415
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,300
 kind of the soulmate, the one that was made for me,

416
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,420
 then it's really gonna be easy.

417
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
 We're gonna have our ups and downs.

418
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,540
 You know, life has those, but for the most part,

419
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,920
 it's not gonna be that much work.

420
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,660
 It's just kinda gonna go naturally,

421
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,420
 and everything's gonna work out well for us.

422
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 And the Bible says that is just not true.

423
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,860
 Paul even says in 1 Corinthians 7 that if you get married,

424
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,100
 you need to know it is going to bring trouble

425
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,060
 into your life, and I wanna spare you of that.

426
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,280
 It is going to be hard.

427
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,040
 It is amazing, and there is work always involved.

428
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,540
 If you want to stay in love, it will always involve work.

429
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,940
 And just because things get challenging

430
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,020
 in someone's marriage, or they find themselves

431
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,460
 in a hard time, does not mean that they should not be

432
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,220
 in a marriage with that person.

433
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,580
 Staying in love will always find, or always include work.

434
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,300
 People often think that, hey, man, whenever it gets hard,

435
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,540
 it shouldn't be like this.

436
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,900
 I think, you know, they just weren't the one for me.

437
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,620
 Or maybe this, you know, we were never really, truly in love,

438
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,920
 and that is a flawed way of thinking.

439
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,780
 The Bible says the way that you keep romance,

440
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,440
 or the way that romance stays in a relationship,

441
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,220
 includes work, pursuing each other, sacrificing,

442
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,740
 communicating with one another,

443
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
 working through conflict together,

444
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,640
 as they did in the last chapter there.

445
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,660
 It's as though God says this is a gift, marriage,

446
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,860
 which it is, that requires work every time.

447
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,260
 It's like in Proverbs chapter 18, verse 22, it says this.

448
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,660
 The one who finds a wife finds what is enjoyable,

449
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,780
 or a good thing, and receives a pleasurable gift

450
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,920
 from the Lord.

451
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,100
 It is a gift that comes with work in order to make it work.

452
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,820
 It is a gift that comes with work in order to make it work.

453
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,180
 So in other words, if you're gonna have a marriage

454
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,060
 that lasts some day, you need to know,

455
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,540
 it is gonna require work.

456
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,700
 It is gonna require you and the other person being committed.

457
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,380
 We are in this, we are gonna work through,

458
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,500
 we're gonna grow together, we're gonna sacrifice

459
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,620
 and serve one another, put each other's desires and needs

460
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,580
 in front of our own, and continue to care first

461
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,820
 for the other person above ourself.

462
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,780
 It's gonna require work, and work,

463
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,220
 this incredible gift, God says, that I'm giving to people,

464
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,060
 will also be a gift that comes with it some work,

465
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,740
 because there isn't, you're like, hey, I'm just looking

466
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,120
 for the most compatible person.

467
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,940
 There has never been a wedding in the history of history

468
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,540
 that involves two people who are compatible,

469
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,380
 because you have two sinners who at some times in their life

470
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,500
 are gonna be incompatible, not just with you,

471
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,740
 but with humanity.

472
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,020
 And so there has never been some occasion where it's like,

473
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,860
 man, if you just find the most perfect, compatible person,

474
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,900
 you are looking for a unicorn that is out there.

475
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,980
 It is a gift that involves work every single time.

476
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,820
 It's like this.

477
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,260
 I recently had a friend that offered to give me a suit.

478
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,100
 They worked, her and her husband were like,

479
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,760
 hey, we're gonna give you a suit.

480
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
 They work at this clothing line,

481
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,400
 and they knew that I'd had multiple suits

482
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,860
 that because of my opening illustration,

483
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,300
 two times that I was getting into the car,

484
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,120
 they ripped, and I was like, I gotta go to the tailor again,

485
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,300
 on the dance floor again after it, and they just ripped.

486
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,580
 And so they knew, hey, we gotta get you a new suit.

487
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,460
 So they called me, came out to the shop,

488
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,540
 they were like, man, let me take you over to the warehouse,

489
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,500
 like get in the warehouse.

490
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,000
 They say every single one of these suits,

491
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,940
 and almost as big as this section,

492
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,300
 there was suit after suit after suit,

493
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,780
 and they got black and red,

494
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,420
 and every color that you would imagine,

495
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
 and blue and gray and everything,

496
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,340
 they were like, hey, you pick any of 'em.

497
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,420
 And that would be our gift to you.

498
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,800
 But you need to know, these are all returns,

499
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,140
 and they've all been formed and shaped

500
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,740
 in a bunch of different people's height and size and weight,

501
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,260
 so no matter which one you choose,

502
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,580
 and you can pick any of 'em,

503
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,420
 it's gonna require work to make it work.

504
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,820
 In the same way, in other words,

505
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,220
 it's gonna require you taking that suit

506
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,920
 and taking it to a tailor 'cause it's too big here,

507
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,940
 it's too long in the pants,

508
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,580
 or it's too big in the waist or in the jacket.

509
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,220
 It's gonna require this free gift,

510
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,980
 or this gift to you will require some work

511
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,400
 and tailoring in order to make it work.

512
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,660
 No matter who you choose, if you're dating somebody,

513
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,100
 or if you ever date somebody, here's what you need to know.

514
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,540
 They are not gonna be the perfect person

515
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,900
 that you complete together, and it's like,

516
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,300
 hey, this is gonna be easy all the time.

517
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,780
 It is going to require tremendous work

518
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,060
 in order to keep the relationship

519
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,140
 and the love in that relationship alive

520
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,260
 through communication, dealing through conflict,

521
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,500
 prioritizing each other.

522
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,340
 It's gonna require work, and here's the truth.

523
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,380
 Guys, just like I was like, hey,

524
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,460
 any of these suits you could pick,

525
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,460
 and all of them are gonna require some sort of tailoring.

526
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,740
 If you're a believer in the room,

527
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,160
 and there's a believer who's a girl in the room or anywhere,

528
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,500
 you could pick really any of the suits

529
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,580
 or the suitors out there, and you could make it work

530
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,220
 if you're willing to do the work.

531
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,860
 And you're gonna have to do the work

532
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,380
 in order to make any relationship work.

533
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,340
 Does that make sense?

534
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,820
 So you can pick any of 'em, just like in that scenario.

535
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
 I'll pick any of these,

536
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,900
 and they're gonna require some tailoring.

537
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,220
 I don't care, and girls, I don't care who you pick.

538
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,460
 As handsome and as great as he seems like he is,

539
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,260
 you're gonna find out soon, especially if you marry him,

540
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,500
 that this brother needs some work,

541
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,580
 and you have to be willing to do the work.

542
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,420
 That's really the question in marriage.

543
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,980
 It's not like, will it be hard?

544
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,500
 It's gonna be hard, and it is the most amazing gift,

545
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,260
 but it will only work for those

546
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,700
 who are willing to do the work.

547
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,940
 Love always requires work.

548
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,580
 So here's the last thing I'll say about this point.

549
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,300
 What this means is that looking

550
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
 for the most compatible person for you

551
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,500
 is a foolish thing to spend your time doing.

552
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,660
 One, because no matter who it is,

553
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,740
 they're gonna be incompatible.

554
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,780
 At some level, in some way,

555
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,300
 they're gonna be incompatible with you.

556
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,720
 You're kinda just picking your problems,

557
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,860
 just like picking the suit pants.

558
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,180
 Do I want too long, or do I want,

559
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,300
 doesn't matter, I've gotta do work either way.

560
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
 And the second reason why it's foolish

561
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,420
 to look for the most compatible person is this.

562
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,020
 I'm gonna pop somebody's bubble.

563
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,520
 You're never gonna find them.

564
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,780
 Why do I say that?

565
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,900
 You're like, I'm American, I'm gonna prove you wrong.

566
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,740
 No, you're not.

567
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,560
 Here's why.

568
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,780
 Because in our generation, or in society right now,

569
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,940
 if you're between the ages of 20 and 35,

570
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,820
 here's what you need to know.

571
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,900
 There's about 70 million of you in America.

572
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,480
 So let's assume there's about 70 million options

573
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,320
 for you in America.

574
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,780
 Maybe you're like, dude, I'll date a 50-year-old.

575
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,260
 Great, you do you.

576
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,260
 Either way, there's about 70 million of people

577
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,140
 on 10 years either side of you in America.

578
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
 Of the opposite sex, there's about 35 million.

579
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
 I think they've even got slides.

580
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,740
 So there you go, now we're down to 35 million.

581
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,260
 That's the potential people, likely,

582
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,860
 that you're gonna get married to.

583
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,460
 And then inside of that, statistically,

584
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,180
 there's about 12 million who are Christians.

585
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,500
 That feels a little generous,

586
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
 people who are actually following Jesus,

587
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,020
 but let's go with it.

588
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,980
 And then inside of that group of 12 million people

589
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,760
 of the opposite sex, 10 years either side of you,

590
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,580
 then you gotta go, well, you know, let's be honest.

591
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,540
 Who am I attracted to?

592
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
 And probably not all 12 million.

593
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,900
 So let's whittle that down 'cause I'm probably a nine,

594
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,740
 so I'm looking for a nine.

595
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,780
 And so that's gonna be roughly three million, maybe,

596
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,700
 depending on your standard out there.

597
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,080
 Three million people that could be viable options for you.

598
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,580
 Now, let's assume you could get in contact with all of them

599
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,240
 because in order to find the most compatible person for you,

600
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,500
 you have to evaluate every single one of them.

601
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,080
 In order to find the most, you know,

602
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,740
 the best orange at the grocery store,

603
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
 I have to pick up every single orange

604
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
 and evaluate every single one of them

605
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,260
 or else I can't know, did I get the right orange

606
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,740
 or get the best orange out there.

607
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,780
 In order for you to know,

608
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,140
 I have got the most compatible person option

609
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,980
 that I have out there.

610
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,820
 You have got to spend time

611
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,100
 and evaluate every single one of them.

612
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,120
 Now, if you did speed dating with all three million of them,

613
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,120
 that would take roughly 15 million minutes,

614
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,940
 which would be the equivalent of 57 years.

615
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,420
 If you do it 12 hours a day and you're a go-getter,

616
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,840
 you would be 82 years old if you're 25.

617
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,340
 So point being, let me just, let me hammer it home

618
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,780
 'cause you're like, no, I still could find me.

619
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,740
 No, you won't.

620
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,700
 You're not gonna find the most compatible person out there.

621
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,300
 You're gonna marry someone who is not as compatible

622
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,820
 as somebody else could be for you.

623
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,020
 And as long as you hide behind, you know,

624
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,100
 I'm just, I'm still searching

625
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,620
 for like the most compatible person.

626
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,620
 You are searching for a leprechaun and a unicorn.

627
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,900
 That might as well be your task out there

628
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,120
 'cause you are not gonna find them.

629
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,840
 So you can't find the most compatible,

630
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,300
 but you can find someone, listen to me very closely,

631
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,900
 with the qualities that God says matter most.

632
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,620
 Qualities of character.

633
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,980
 If you're a guy, I want you to write down

634
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,700
 1 Peter chapter three and Titus chapter two,

635
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,860
 and I want you to go read the qualities

636
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,100
 of the type of godly woman that you should have,

637
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,380
 or Proverbs 31.

638
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,500
 If you're a girl, you should be looking for a guy

639
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,740
 that God says is the type of man

640
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,740
 that he would let lead his bride, the church,

641
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,340
 and those are laid out in 1 Peter chapter three

642
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,100
 and Titus chapter one.

643
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,780
 You will not find the most compatible.

644
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,620
 You're not even gonna find the most attractive.

645
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,740
 Hate to burst your bubble.

646
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,960
 Even if you boil it down and you're like,

647
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
 I don't need that long.

648
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,060
 It's like tender version, just 60 seconds a person,

649
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
 you could do it.

650
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,820
 It's gonna take you 15 years.

651
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,620
 And so looking for the most attractive

652
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,300
 or most compatible is not an option,

653
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,540
 but finding someone with the qualities

654
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,260
 God says matter most is,

655
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,860
 and regardless of who you pick,

656
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,580
 they are gonna be incompatible for you,

657
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,580
 and it's gonna require work to keep staying in love together

658
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,260
 and working through and growing.

659
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,660
 Okay, so the second quality.

660
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,160
 That we see is that staying in love

661
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,900
 requires and involves serving.

662
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,960
 Just like this couple worked to care for their relationship,

663
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,140
 they prioritized one another, they got out of town,

664
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,300
 they pursued each other sexually,

665
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
 they cared for one another's needs,

666
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,920
 they worked through conflict, we're told in chapter four,

667
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,720
 they also over and over again served one another.

668
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,800
 If you're gonna be in a relationship

669
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,400
 or have a love that stays, if you're gonna stay in love,

670
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,620
 it doesn't happen in neutral.

671
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,480
 You can fall in love,

672
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,180
 but it requires being intentional to stay in love.

673
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,020
 And if you're gonna stay in love,

674
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,240
 the second thing it always involves

675
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
 is serving the other person.

676
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,880
 Here's why this is important.

677
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,180
 Underneath a lot of the reasons

678
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,240
 why a lot of us wanna get married

679
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
 is the assumption that I'm gonna get married

680
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,560
 and this person is gonna meet my needs.

681
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,540
 You know, I'm gonna show up,

682
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,900
 I'm gonna come home from work in a long day,

683
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,600
 and she's gonna be standing there in lingerie

684
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,180
 with the laundry done and cooking dinner,

685
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,240
 and like, oh man, it's time for sex again,

686
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,800
 three more times before we hit bed,

687
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,240
 and that is not gonna happen.

688
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,200
 And it's kind of like, oh, this person is kind of there

689
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,260
 to be the, you know, fulfillment or the meter of my needs,

690
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,140
 or the girl, you have the opposite thing,

691
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,300
 where you're like, he's gonna come home,

692
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,180
 we're just gonna sit there, stare in each other's eyes,

693
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
 light candles, and just talk about our day,

694
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,420
 and he's gonna be like, honey, you need another massage,

695
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,260
 go, go, you've worked so hard,

696
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,520
 and it's not gonna happen.

697
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,780
 And you need to enter into marriage,

698
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,080
 and here's how you can know that you're ready to get married.

699
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,340
 When you're at a place where you're like,

700
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,020
 I do not see this as an opportunity for them to serve me,

701
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,620
 I want to serve them for the rest of my life,

702
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,900
 and there's gonna be moments in all of us,

703
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,100
 in everyone who gets married, where it's selfish,

704
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,180
 and there's sinful parts of my heart

705
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,460
 that don't want to serve.

706
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,500
 But if you're gonna enter into a covenant,

707
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,040
 you need to go in thinking that, hey,

708
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,060
 I'm in this to not get anything out,

709
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,700
 but to give towards this person.

710
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,660
 I'm not about what I can take, what I can get,

711
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,900
 I'm about what I can give,

712
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,040
 because staying in love involves serving

713
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,580
 the other person, and the beautiful thing

714
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,540
 is when two people who love Jesus come together,

715
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,100
 and both of them are committed to serving the other person.

716
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,760
 And it's like, no, no, I'm here to serve you,

717
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,100
 no, I'm here to serve you, no, I'm here to serve you,

718
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,000
 and it just goes back and forth between one another.

719
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,340
 And it's the way God intended marriage to be.

720
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,700
 In Ephesians chapter five, it says,

721
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,660
 "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ."

722
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,000
 That if you're gonna have a love that stays,

723
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
 it is gonna involve serving one another.

724
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,020
 They served one another.

725
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,100
 How did she do it?

726
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,380
 She dances naked in front of her husband.

727
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,860
 My guess is, this wasn't something that she was like,

728
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,500
 oh, this is just what I do every Tuesday.

729
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,140
 She was committed to serving her husband.

730
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,900
 Am I saying that that's like the application

731
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,940
 you should take away in your marriage someday?

732
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,840
 I don't know, you do you.

733
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,420
 But point being, she was serving her husband.

734
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,820
 The other ways that she served is she planned

735
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,980
 a weekend to get out of town.

736
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,900
 All throughout the book, we're told that she initiates,

737
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,320
 she pursues, and she praises her husband.

738
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,820
 She tells us that she has brought creativity

739
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,140
 into the bedroom to serve her husband.

740
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,540
 He serves her by consistently communicating

741
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,180
 and working through conflict, by praising her

742
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,940
 and going over and creating a safe place to care for her,

743
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,520
 saying this is who you are to me,

744
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,340
 driving clarity into the relationship.

745
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,260
 They served one another over and over and over again.

746
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,060
 He made clear that the standard of beauty

747
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
 for him was his wife.

748
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,060
 And if you get married, and guys,

749
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,260
 this probably goes without saying,

750
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,520
 but just in case it doesn't, when you get married,

751
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
 when you decide, I'm gonna say I do,

752
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,100
 that woman now is your standard of beauty.

753
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,260
 If you get married and she's a blonde, you like blondes.

754
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,140
 If you get married and she's a brunette, you like brunettes.

755
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,300
 If you get married and she's tall, you're into tall.

756
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
 If you get married and she's short, you're into short.

757
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,920
 If you get married and she's thin, you're into thin.

758
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,900
 If you get married and she was formerly thin,

759
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,940
 you're into formerly thin.

760
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,860
 Whatever the characteristics, she is now the quality

761
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,060
 and characteristic of what beauty is to you.

762
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,500
 And your role is to go, man, God, I wanna feed anything,

763
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,380
 not right now, 'cause you're single,

764
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,460
 or unless you're married, I wanna feed anything

765
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,900
 that just allows me to continue to see my wife

766
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,240
 is the epitome of beauty.

767
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,380
 And whatever changes and whatever happens to her body,

768
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,240
 she is my standard of what beauty is.

769
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,220
 I'm gonna feed that attraction in her

770
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,940
 and I'm gonna starve anything that competes with that.

771
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,940
 This is why pornography is so dangerous,

772
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
 because it disrupts that.

773
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,380
 It begins to feed you, hey, you know what you need?

774
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,160
 It's not her, you need variety.

775
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,620
 You need blonde here, brunette here, you need plastic.

776
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,900
 Same thing with women.

777
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
 Pornography does the same thing to both.

778
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,660
 And the goal now, just like the goal in marriage,

779
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,860
 is to starve anything that competes,

780
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,020
 whether it's just a glancing at a woman in the office

781
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,860
 who bends over and you're tempted to take a double take,

782
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,940
 or it's pornography.

783
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,300
 I cannot recommend if pornography,

784
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
 which is a large struggle for many people in the room,

785
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,620
 is a part of your story, or currently,

786
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,740
 if pornography has been something you looked at

787
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,180
 and last week, getting Covenant Eyes.

788
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
 Covenant Eyes is a software and app that goes on your phone.

789
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,860
 I've spent hundreds of dollars,

790
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,420
 hundreds of dollars over the last decade,

791
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,500
 and they're some of the best money that I've ever spent.

792
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,340
 It's like 9.99 a month is to becoming an ad for Covenant Eyes

793
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,580
 but putting it on your phone

794
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,700
 so that you can have people in your life

795
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,540
 who can hold you accountable,

796
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,500
 sends an email to other people that help

797
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,780
 hold you accountable, that hey,

798
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,580
 what were you searching and feeding your heart?

799
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,620
 For him, we're not told that she had done

800
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,340
 all types of exercise.

801
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,440
 If it had been a few years,

802
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,180
 maybe they had kids, their stretch marks,

803
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,060
 and he goes, you are the standard of beauty.

804
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,860
 I love everything about you.

805
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,500
 Even that nose, like a tower.

806
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,020
 I'm into tower noses, I love it.

807
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
 That's what he says.

808
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,380
 And the same thing is true of women,

809
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,580
 for the men in your life,

810
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,420
 that you're gonna end up married to a guy

811
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,820
 and hair is gonna go from here to back here,

812
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,660
 and they're gonna have changes to their body,

813
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,100
 and that guy is the standard of beauty

814
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,620
 or standard of attraction for you,

815
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,100
 and you can come alongside of him

816
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,580
 and you can do what very few wives do,

817
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,340
 which is what she does all throughout the book.

818
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,060
 You can praise him and praise the qualities

819
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,100
 that you wanna see grow in him,

820
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,940
 and they'll grow.

821
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,020
 Or you can starve them and think,

822
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,860
 well, he didn't deserve it,

823
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,180
 and he didn't need that type of encouragement,

824
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,580
 and he needs to do more for me,

825
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,620
 and they won't grow.

826
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,180
 There was a guy, a pastor on our staff,

827
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,200
 who said that if you, in getting married,

828
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,020
 treat your husband as a loser, he will be a loser.

829
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,680
 And if you treat him as a king, he'll be a king.

830
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,820
 And some of the words that you use

831
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,940
 are the most powerful things to a future husband

832
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,760
 that you're gonna have,

833
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,020
 but she comes alongside, she serves,

834
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,580
 they serve and they devote themselves

835
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,420
 to caring for one another.

836
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,660
 So how do I know that I'm marrying someone

837
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,940
 or moving towards a relationship

838
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,420
 with someone who's gonna be a servant lover,

839
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,380
 not a selfish lover?

840
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,780
 'Cause guys, oh man, this is so huge.

841
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,260
 Listen back in in case you're losing it

842
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,300
 and you're looking at the Astros game

843
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,900
 or counting these things over here.

844
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,860
 Marrying someone who's hot, who's selfish,

845
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,460
 is gonna make for a relationship

846
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,420
 that you don't wanna be in.

847
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,820
 I've seen it just too many times with a guy,

848
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,620
 I mean, I can think of names and people

849
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,940
 just haven't done this the last 10 years.

850
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,300
 And they married someone and she's so hot

851
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,540
 and she's over there and she's got

852
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,380
 all types of cosmetic work done everywhere,

853
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,320
 and you're like, man, she was a former model,

854
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,740
 but she's so selfish.

855
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,140
 And the relationship and the intimacy

856
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,860
 that they experience in marriage

857
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,580
 pales in comparison to someone else

858
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,380
 who doesn't look quite like the supermodel

859
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,620
 and she's beautiful, this other person,

860
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,220
 but they're a servant of Jesus

861
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,700
 and they give themselves to their husband

862
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,760
 and they care for their husband

863
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,060
 and they encourage their husband

864
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,140
 and they talk about their husband

865
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,220
 in a positive way when they're in public.

866
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,700
 And they experience a relationship

867
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,540
 and an intimacy like just doesn't matter

868
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
 as much as you're like, dude,

869
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,480
 but her being hot really matters.

870
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,800
 It really doesn't.

871
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,380
 When it comes down to the relationship

872
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,500
 that you want to have,

873
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,340
 if it comes at the cost of her being a servant lover,

874
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,740
 how can you know they're gonna be a servant lover

875
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,000
 if they're following Jesus

876
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,100
 and they're committed to their life following Jesus

877
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,820
 who said he is a servant king

878
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,720
 and anyone who follows him will serve?

879
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,540
 Ephesians chapter five, Paul even commands it

880
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,340
 or the Bible commands husbands,

881
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,000
 serve your wife, lay down your life for her.

882
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,860
 Your needs and put everything that you want,

883
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,920
 everything from like, hey, the temperature in the room,

884
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,300
 my wife thinks it's hot, I think it's freezing

885
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,520
 and we'll move in the direction of compromise,

886
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,560
 which means we keep it at whatever she wants.

887
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,580
 This is the type of thing that you're gonna have.

888
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,060
 (congregation laughing)

889
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,180
 And the goal is mutual, back and forth,

890
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,540
 where you're serving and caring and loving for one another.

891
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,060
 Are you in relationship with someone who's a servant?

892
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,180
 'Cause I know if you're dating him,

893
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,740
 you're probably like, they're attractive.

894
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,520
 Are they a servant?

895
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,380
 Will they be a servant?

896
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,140
 Are they following Jesus right now?

897
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,540
 There's a cliche triangle that really is,

898
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,120
 captures the essence of how you can know

899
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
 your relationship is gonna grow together

900
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,380
 where it just puts this idea of here's how you can know

901
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,560
 that you and him are gonna move towards one another.

902
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,060
 The further that you move in the direction of God,

903
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,700
 the further that you are gonna move

904
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,900
 in the direction of one another.

905
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,140
 And the opposite is true.

906
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:17,700
 The further that you move distance from God,

907
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,300
 the further you're gonna move in distance from one another.

908
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,460
 So here's the question I have for you if you're dating.

909
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:26,820
 Where or what direction are you

910
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,720
 and the person that you're dating moving on that triangle?

911
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,180
 Are they moving closer to God?

912
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,680
 Are you moving closer to God?

913
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,960
 If so, man, that's a great thing

914
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,640
 and you should be really encouraged to be like,

915
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,200
 this is only gonna hopefully get better

916
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,040
 and better and better.

917
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,820
 Or are they, be honest, moving further away from God,

918
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,500
 even if you're moving closer?

919
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,380
 And if so, you should be concerned.

920
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,500
 The third equality that is involved

921
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,580
 anytime someone stays in love is this.

922
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,580
 Staying in love involves sexually pursuing each other.

923
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,220
 Now hold on, 'cause people are about, wait a second.

924
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,500
 Over and over throughout this book,

925
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,240
 we're giving example after example

926
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
 of them pursuing each other sexually.

927
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
 I mean, dude, it gets hot and bothered,

928
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,160
 from a striptease to oral sex to just like them

929
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,960
 having sex out in the woods.

930
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,600
 It's like, good grief.

931
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,320
 Oh man, I'm so uncomfortable reading this right now.

932
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,560
 But they had this sexual intimacy where they pursued

933
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,400
 and they cared and they prioritized one another.

934
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
 Do you know, in case you're like,

935
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,600
 well, that's kind of a leap,

936
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,560
 the Bible in another place commands husbands,

937
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,000
 your sexual rights are not your own,

938
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,440
 wives, your sexual rights are not your own.

939
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,160
 First Corinthians chapter seven, it commands,

940
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,060
 in case you're like, wait, really?

941
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,140
 In order to have love that lasts,

942
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,060
 you have to have sex involved?

943
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,820
 Yes, a husband should give to his wife her sexual rights.

944
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,920
 And likewise, a wife to her husband.

945
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,700
 It's not the wife who has the rights of her own body,

946
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,540
 but the husband.

947
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,760
 In the same way, it's not the husband

948
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,020
 who has the rights to his own body, but the wife.

949
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,060
 Do not deprive each other except for by mutual agreement

950
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,160
 for a specified time so that you may

951
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,860
 devote yourselves to prayer.

952
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,320
 Now Paul says, the only circumstances under which

953
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,680
 you should reject one another is if you're spending

954
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,300
 time in prayer, which, side note, guys,

955
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,860
 if you get married someday and you're excited

956
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,820
 about moving forward, hopefully that night,

957
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,820
 getting lucky, I would not introduce this idea

958
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,700
 of like, hey, well, we're not, is this a prayer night?

959
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
 Is that what this is?

960
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,940
 Has never gone well for me in the experience

961
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,860
 of our relationship, but Paul would say,

962
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,500
 and I'm playing clearly, but Paul would say,

963
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,280
 hey, do not deprive one another sexually in marriage.

964
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,640
 Your rights are no longer your own,

965
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,800
 and his rights are no longer his own.

966
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
 That you're to give yourselves to one another.

967
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
 It is commanded, and every time that love lasts

968
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,640
 over and over, and there's so many psychological studies,

969
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,240
 even the secular world, outside of anything related

970
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,240
 to church says, is that love that lasts involves pursuing

971
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,040
 and caring for one another sexually,

972
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,600
 and there's gonna be extreme scenarios

973
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,120
 where somebody gets sick, or there's seasons of life

974
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,940
 where that's not possible, but by and large,

975
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,140
 most of the sexless marriages in America,

976
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,160
 and there's about 25% that are,

977
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,660
 are not because of somebody in some crazy tragedy

978
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,660
 or accident, they're because they didn't pursue one another,

979
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,540
 and all of a sudden, that flame just went cold.

980
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,940
 Sexual intimacy will always involve that.

981
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,740
 Here's what you need to know, though.

982
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,340
 The temptation here is gonna be to think,

983
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,240
 well, in order for that to remain red hot,

984
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,080
 I need to introduce sex, and I need to make sure

985
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,160
 that I'm on the same page sexually with that other person,

986
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,800
 so like in dating, I need to make sure

987
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
 our expectations are the same, we're sexually compatible,

988
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,600
 we have the same kind of chemistry,

989
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,560
 'cause I don't wanna get in marriage,

990
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,960
 and it's a big part of marriage, clearly,

991
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,040
 and I don't wanna get in there and be like,

992
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,720
 oh, we're just totally off the same page,

993
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,920
 and I really have a high sex drive,

994
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
 and they're just not as kinky as I'd like.

995
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,920
 I'm like, let's do role play, cops and robbers,

996
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,880
 and they're just not into that,

997
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,360
 and so we need to figure that out before we get married.

998
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,520
 Here's why that's a bad idea.

999
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,400
 Here's why.

1000
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,720
 Couple reasons, one, all of your sexual drive

1001
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,920
 and sexual desires and all that stuff is gonna change.

1002
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,720
 Different seasons of your life,

1003
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,320
 after she has kids, or during the time

1004
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,520
 where it's immediately after a child is born,

1005
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,080
 there's this long, dark winter

1006
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,840
 where it just won't look like that.

1007
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,640
 There's different seasons where the body's gonna change,

1008
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,920
 where hormones, where all kinds of stuff,

1009
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,320
 whatever sexual drive that you have,

1010
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,660
 it's not going to look that same,

1011
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,480
 so whatever you're like, oh, we're on the same page,

1012
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,080
 and six months into marriage,

1013
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,000
 not on the same page anymore,

1014
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,380
 so it's a foolish thing to make sure

1015
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,800
 that we're on the same page.

1016
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,900
 Secondly, it's foolish because the best chance you have

1017
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,080
 of making sure we're sexually on the same page

1018
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,320
 is by pursuing, not sex before marriage,

1019
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,320
 but a servant lover who's gonna be like,

1020
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,360
 I'm going to move in the direction of the things

1021
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,940
 that sexually are gonna serve my husband

1022
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,760
 or serve my wife together,

1023
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,520
 not getting on the same page about,

1024
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,520
 oh, we're both into the same stuff before you get married.

1025
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,960
 And the biggest reason why it's such a bad idea

1026
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,980
 is sex is this powerful thing,

1027
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,440
 and I know we've talked a lot about it in this series,

1028
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,840
 but you've gotta hear me.

1029
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,720
 Sex was given by God, and it does two things every time.

1030
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,980
 It blinds and it binds.

1031
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,680
 It binds you together, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6,

1032
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,120
 and then it glues you.

1033
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,380
 He writes in 1 Corinthians 6, verse 18,

1034
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,920
 there were these dudes inside of the church

1035
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
 who didn't really realize this,

1036
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
 and they're hanging out, and they're like,

1037
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,400
 yeah, we're married, but we also go down to the temple

1038
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
 every now and then 'cause our wives' sex drive

1039
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,600
 are not the same, and we have sex with these prostitutes,

1040
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,640
 which feels like Christianity 101, don't do,

1041
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,480
 but Paul writes, and he says,

1042
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,600
 don't you know every time you have sex with a prostitute,

1043
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,120
 you are gluing yourself to her?

1044
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,960
 That's what sex does.

1045
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,660
 It binds you to that other person

1046
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,920
 where there's always an exchange of them taking part of you

1047
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,560
 and you taking part of them

1048
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,160
 'cause it's so much more than physical.

1049
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,880
 Sex not only binds you together, it also blinds you.

1050
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,680
 In Proverbs chapter five, it says that love,

1051
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,440
 let me see if I even have it,

1052
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,180
 that love is intoxicating.

1053
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,920
 It says basically, hey, you should let your wife

1054
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,560
 and the wife of your youth and her breasts

1055
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,780
 satisfy you at all times.

1056
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,840
 Let you always be intoxicated in her love.

1057
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,540
 Let you always be drunk in love or always drunk in sex.

1058
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,680
 Long before Beyonce said it, Solomon said it,

1059
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,460
 and here's why you need to know that.

1060
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,140
 Sex, any time you introduce it,

1061
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,080
 it's blinding your inhibitions.

1062
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,540
 It's binding you to that person

1063
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,320
 and blinding you to their flaws.

1064
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,040
 That is incredibly important and powerful in marriage

1065
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,840
 because it allows you to overlook small offenses.

1066
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,840
 You're coming back together and unifying.

1067
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,920
 Incredibly dangerous though is sex in the context of dating

1068
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,080
 because the dude is throwing all kinds of red flags

1069
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,360
 out there that you should be seeing,

1070
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,920
 but because you're intoxicated or drunk,

1071
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,360
 you're not able to see them as clearly.

1072
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,880
 You're dating after having a few glasses of wine

1073
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,000
 and you're like, yeah, he seems great,

1074
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,600
 and it's like, he doesn't speak English,

1075
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,000
 and that would be nuts, you would think.

1076
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 In the same way, that is essentially what the Bible says.

1077
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,280
 It's like any time you introduce sex,

1078
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,240
 you can't think clearly because that's the point of sex.

1079
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,000
 It binds you and it blinds you,

1080
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
 and you are setting yourself up

1081
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,440
 to make one of the most important decisions of your life,

1082
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
 buzzed and intoxicated,

1083
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,600
 and this incredible gift that God has given.

1084
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,480
 So that's the reason why trying before you bind,

1085
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,000
 all of that nonsense is not just nonsense.

1086
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,160
 It is incredibly destructive and incredibly dangerous,

1087
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,240
 and some of you, you have stayed in relationships

1088
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,040
 way too long because you have sexually gone farther

1089
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
 than you ever thought that you would,

1090
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,800
 and you feel like, you know, we've already gone there.

1091
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,880
 I feel like, you know, we might as well

1092
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,440
 just keep moving forward, and you need to break up.

1093
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,880
 And if you're like, no, it's not important.

1094
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,360
 We can go without sex.

1095
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,520
 Go without sex.

1096
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,920
 In order that you can rightly evaluate the relationship

1097
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,880
 and whether or not it should continue moving forward.

1098
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,960
 The second reason why, you know,

1099
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,840
 pursuing a relationship just 'cause sexual intimacy,

1100
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,940
 or even prioritizing that, like, you know,

1101
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,080
 is the sex gonna be really good?

1102
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,960
 We're kinda into all the same stuff.

1103
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,400
 It's such a foolish thing because you know

1104
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,040
 the percentage of time that you're gonna spend

1105
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,360
 in marriage and sex?

1106
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,680
 Like, it's crazy.

1107
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,080
 It's like less than 1%.

1108
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,560
 In other words, you're gonna spend most of life,

1109
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,760
 and most of marriage is not just like sex and sex and sex.

1110
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
 It's less than 1% on a good day.

1111
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,580
 What do I mean by that?

1112
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,040
 Okay, so here's some of the numbers.

1113
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,400
 The average person is gonna spend,

1114
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,560
 everyone above average.

1115
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,280
 In a given year, if you had sex four times a week

1116
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,160
 for 30 minutes each time,

1117
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,160
 you will spend 1% of that year having sex in marriage.

1118
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,520
 That means 99% of the time that you're spending

1119
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,760
 with that person not doing sex.

1120
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,320
 And maybe you're out there like, hey, four times a week,

1121
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,640
 not us, we're doing seven.

1122
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,140
 That's what we're going.

1123
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,360
 No, you're not, but let's give it to you.

1124
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,440
 You know what the statistic would be there?

1125
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,120
 2%.

1126
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,720
 Why would you make a decision based on 2%

1127
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
 of what you're actually gonna do in marriage?

1128
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,600
 And really, I mean, let's be honest, dude.

1129
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,320
 It's really that important to make sure

1130
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
 like she's good in bed or he's good in bed?

1131
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,460
 Think about what you're telling yourself there.

1132
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,780
 You're telling, I want somebody who has had so much sex

1133
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,120
 outside of marriage that they're amazing at this act

1134
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,560
 because they've had so many other sexual partners.

1135
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,280
 And if that's part of your story and wherever you're at,

1136
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,040
 man, God can heal and work in the midst of all of that.

1137
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,180
 But the idea of like, man, she's a lady in the street,

1138
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,960
 freak of the bed, and she's a virgin, and that's,

1139
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,280
 that doesn't exist.

1140
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,680
 And you're prioritizing something that is so small

1141
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,080
 that it's so destructive.

1142
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,580
 And it's such a foolish thing to bank a relationship

1143
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,440
 surviving and a relationship on, but staying in love

1144
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,700
 in marriage involves sexually pursuing one another.

1145
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,000
 Where is the line sexually of what you can do?

1146
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,400
 This is where having a servant lover and being together

1147
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,240
 and saying, man, I want to care for you

1148
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,320
 and I want to prioritize you and I don't want to do

1149
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,560
 anything that is uncomfortable with you.

1150
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,880
 That's essentially where the line is.

1151
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,700
 Wherever you two together say, man, I'm serving

1152
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,620
 and loving one another.

1153
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,620
 This couple is fully indulging in their relationship

1154
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:01,160
 as they pursue one another and they stay in love together.

1155
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,320
 But today, the best chance for those of you who are dating

1156
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,000
 or single is to make sure you are prioritizing pursuing

1157
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,340
 purity as you pursue that other person.

1158
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,340
 I think a lie that so many people believe is that,

1159
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,900
 man, you know where great sex happens?

1160
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,240
 Like I just need to make sure that they are great at sex

1161
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,140
 and then we'll have great sex together.

1162
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,640
 And so it doesn't happen in marriage.

1163
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,020
 It happens just kind of based on how they look

1164
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,620
 or how good they are.

1165
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,680
 And you've never had great sex.

1166
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,700
 And you think you have, and right now you're like,

1167
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,960
 oh, you don't know me, I totally have.

1168
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,460
 And you have no idea where great sex is like.

1169
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,260
 Great sex outside of the confines of marriage

1170
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,100
 does not exist.

1171
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,940
 And here's what I mean by that.

1172
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,340
 Let me explain it like this.

1173
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,180
 Anybody like acai bowls in here?

1174
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,340
 Okay, three of you, good, awesome.

1175
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,100
 This would be a great illustration.

1176
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,100
 Somebody on my team was like, hey, we gotta go get

1177
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,660
 acai bowls, it's gonna be great.

1178
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,220
 And I was like, it was for lunch, and it was like,

1179
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,340
 who gets acai, that's like soft serve for lunch.

1180
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,460
 Why would we eat soft serve for lunch?

1181
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,780
 And they were like, no, they're so great.

1182
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,180
 Have you ever had an acai bowl?

1183
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,820
 And I said, yes, I've had an acai bowl.

1184
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,940
 And they say, where from?

1185
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,420
 I said, Costco.

1186
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,540
 And they said, oh, that's not an acai bowl.

1187
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,500
 They call it an acai bowl, but it's insulting

1188
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,340
 when you look at the picture.

1189
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,860
 That's not what an acai bowl is.

1190
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,700
 You've never actually had an acai bowl,

1191
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,260
 even though you think you have.

1192
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,660
 You've never actually had great sex,

1193
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,500
 even if you think you have.

1194
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,060
 Here's what I mean by that.

1195
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,520
 Because outside of the confines of a secure,

1196
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,860
 covenant relationship, which is called marriage,

1197
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,100
 it does not exist.

1198
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,860
 And you may be like, no, it was really great,

1199
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,700
 that one night stand that I had off Tinder.

1200
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,980
 You're having Costco acai bowl.

1201
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,580
 (audience laughing)

1202
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,660
 I want you to hear me really clear.

1203
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,380
 You're having a Costco acai bowl.

1204
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,220
 Why do I say that?

1205
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,420
 Because you know how different it is in the context,

1206
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,260
 like sex is amazing in marriage.

1207
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,080
 And it's not because it's like,

1208
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,380
 oh, we're always swinging from the chandelier

1209
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,600
 and every night's lingerie night.

1210
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,140
 It's because you're in the context

1211
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,260
 of a secure relationship with another person

1212
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,580
 who's covenanted their life to you,

1213
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,700
 saying, I'm not going anywhere.

1214
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,540
 You're not going anywhere.

1215
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,140
 I'm not putting out because I need you to stay.

1216
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,220
 I'm giving myself to you because I love you in marriage

1217
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,420
 and because no matter what, you won't leave.

1218
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,200
 That's what marriage is.

1219
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,300
 And there's a security.

1220
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,540
 And if you're here and you're like, no,

1221
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,140
 but it's so much greater here,

1222
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,940
 you're eating a Costco acai bowl.

1223
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,060
 And I hope you believe me.

1224
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,500
 Those Tinder one night stands,

1225
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,300
 those hookups from the guy off of Bumble,

1226
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,960
 you are selling yourself short for a counterfeit.

1227
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,140
 You're swimming in the shallow end and it's a joke.

1228
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,520
 And I candidly, I feel bad for you

1229
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,680
 because you think you have something that God says,

1230
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,420
 I invented sex, I'm all about it.

1231
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,700
 And I want you to experience levels of intimacy

1232
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,100
 in your marriage that you cannot even dream of.

1233
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,840
 And you've sold yourself short for a joke.

1234
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,620
 And I don't care how much sex that you're having out there,

1235
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,560
 apart from experiencing sex on a physical,

1236
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,240
 emotional and spiritual level,

1237
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,440
 you're eating the Costco bowl.

1238
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,900
 And how tragic.

1239
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,160
 And the God who's there, he hasn't given up on you.

1240
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,120
 He's for you.

1241
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,000
 He loves you.

1242
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,440
 He wants you to experience intimacy

1243
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,640
 in your marriage someday.

1244
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,320
 But it's not a marriage,

1245
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,260
 or it's not gonna be experienced

1246
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,380
 apart from you pursuing purity, pursuing God's way,

1247
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,480
 honoring one another,

1248
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,600
 covening together,

1249
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,320
 and experiencing the design and the place

1250
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,480
 for which he created that binding

1251
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
 and blinding thing to take place.

1252
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,360
 In conclusion, if you wanna have a love that lasts,

1253
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,680
 it'll always involve work.

1254
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,880
 It's always gonna involve serving the other person.

1255
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,880
 And it's always gonna involve sexually pursuing one another.

1256
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,320
 God is so passionate and I'll close here

1257
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,540
 and we can bring the band up.

1258
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,120
 He's passionate about staying in love

1259
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,580
 and this idea of couples staying together in love

1260
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,320
 because God ultimately defines

1261
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,100
 that marriage is all about him.

1262
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,020
 He's the perfect picture of staying in love

1263
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,180
 no matter what you face.

1264
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,220
 So we're laying on the plane, listen to me.

1265
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,780
 He's passionate about staying in love no matter what comes

1266
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,380
 because that is what God is like.

1267
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,460
 There's even a picture that we're given

1268
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,780
 inside of the Bible of a guy named Hosea,

1269
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,860
 where God says, "You know what I'm gonna do?

1270
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,180
 "I'm gonna showcase to the world."

1271
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,020
 You guys with me?

1272
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,520
 It's a book of the Bible called Hosea.

1273
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,320
 And in it, he says, "I'm gonna showcase to the world

1274
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,440
 "I'm a God that no matter what my people do,

1275
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,540
 "no matter despite all the different ways that they fail,

1276
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,980
 "all the different ways that I should leave,

1277
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,100
 "I'm staying in love.

1278
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,480
 "I'm staying, I'm not going anywhere.

1279
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,420
 "And I'm staying."

1280
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,100
 He shows up to a guy named Hosea.

1281
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,020
 He's a man, he lived.

1282
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,260
 He was a prophet in the Old Testament.

1283
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,580
 He shows up and God comes to him and he says,

1284
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,920
 "I want you to do me a favor, Hosea.

1285
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,780
 "I want you to go marry a prostitute."

1286
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,500
 And we're told, Hosea, you know,

1287
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,100
 doesn't respond like most of us would of like,

1288
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,220
 "Come again, what?"

1289
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,780
 Says, "Okay."

1290
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,020
 And I've already got her picked out, her name is Gomer.

1291
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,420
 And I want you to go marry her.

1292
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,400
 And you're gonna have children with this prostitute.

1293
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,940
 You're gonna marry her and not only that,

1294
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,700
 you're gonna have a child from her

1295
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,700
 and she's gonna have other children out of wedlock

1296
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,200
 'cause she's gonna cheat on you over and over and over.

1297
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,900
 And he says, "This will be a picture

1298
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,660
 "of what the people of God do to me

1299
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,000
 "when they chase after other gods

1300
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,140
 "and they break my heart and they go after other lovers

1301
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,940
 "and I never leave them.

1302
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,140
 "I stay in love no matter what comes and what I face,

1303
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,740
 "what is experience or what they do, I stay in love."

1304
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,260
 And you're gonna go do this and we're told that Hosea,

1305
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,900
 he goes and he marries Gomer.

1306
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,860
 And they have one son together.

1307
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,420
 And not long after that, we're told that Hosea,

1308
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,580
 or Gomer, goes around town and she's sleeping around.

1309
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,300
 And she comes home one day and she's pregnant.

1310
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,300
 She's pregnant with a little baby girl, La Roma,

1311
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,220
 is what they name her.

1312
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,900
 Which means God said and he came to her and says,

1313
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,540
 "Name her La Roma, which is not my people

1314
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,540
 "'cause they've turned and gone after other gods."

1315
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,140
 And Hosea is heartbroken but he continues to love Gomer

1316
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,100
 and he continues to care.

1317
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,700
 And then we're told that one day she goes

1318
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,780
 and again she finds herself pregnant by another man.

1319
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,780
 And God says, "I want you to name him Lo-Ami,

1320
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,660
 "not received mercy.

1321
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,700
 "Because my people, despite the fact that I want

1322
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,100
 "to give them mercy and I want them to know

1323
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,300
 "that I'm staying in love and I'm in relationship with them,

1324
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,580
 "they continue to run after other gods.

1325
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,580
 "And I want you to showcase the faithfulness of God,

1326
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,980
 "that I stay in love."

1327
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,300
 And tragically, I mean the book is heartbreaking.

1328
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,500
 Hosea again goes after and we're told shortly after,

1329
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,020
 Hosea is there raising their three little kids

1330
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,620
 and Gomer goes again and she sleeps with another man

1331
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,500
 and it gets so bad she's sold into sex slavery

1332
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
 and becomes the property of another man.

1333
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,580
 And we're not told exactly but for some reason,

1334
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,700
 it's like Hosea was like,

1335
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,340
 "I can't move forward anymore with this."

1336
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,020
 And God shows up and he says,

1337
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,860
 "Go again," Hosea chapter three, verse one.

1338
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,780
 "Go again, Hosea.

1339
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,700
 "Go and love a woman who's the lover

1340
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,660
 "and being loved by a lover who's committing adultery,

1341
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:02,260
 "just like the love of the Lord for the children of Israel,

1342
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,260
 "for the people of God, who look to other gods."

1343
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,300
 Then he shows up and he says, "Go again and love her,

1344
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,460
 "just like I love my people, despite the fact

1345
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,120
 "that every single day they make decisions

1346
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,820
 "where they turn and they worship success,

1347
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,660
 "they worship sex, they worship pornography,

1348
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,940
 "they worship a dating relationship,

1349
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,980
 "they worship whatever this world has to offer

1350
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,060
 "and I never leave them 'cause I stay in love

1351
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,140
 "and I pursue them.

1352
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,100
 "Go again," and we're told that he goes

1353
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,620
 and he's in the middle of the city and he sees her

1354
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,140
 and she's on an auction block being sold.

1355
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,340
 I mean, he's like sitting there, he's going,

1356
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,220
 "That's my wife.

1357
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,820
 "That's my wife," and he goes up and the guy says,

1358
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,800
 "I don't care who she is, this is the price that she's,

1359
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,700
 "you can pay it or not."

1360
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,660
 He doesn't have enough money, we're told.

1361
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,780
 So he goes home and he like gathers up

1362
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,500
 some different things from around the house

1363
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,060
 and he brings like, "Here's 15 shekels

1364
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060
 "and here's some of the stuff that I have,

1365
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,900
 "will you take it?

1366
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,320
 "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.

1367
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,020
 "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.

1368
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,520
 "And I'm staying in love."

1369
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,420
 And God said, "This is just like

1370
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,200
 "the love of the Lord for you."

1371
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,180
 Every single sin that's represented inside of this room,

1372
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,820
 every single dysfunctional relationship

1373
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,020
 you've ever been a part of or are currently a part of

1374
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,140
 in every way that all of us have failed God,

1375
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,980
 he's a God who says, "No matter what comes,

1376
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,620
 "I'm staying, I'm staying in love.

1377
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,180
 "I care about my people being in marriages

1378
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,700
 "where they stay in love and they reflect

1379
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,300
 "the commitment that I have for them

1380
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,960
 "despite all the failures of their spouse,

1381
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,660
 "that I'm not going anywhere."

1382
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,860
 And ultimately the picture of Hosea and Gomer

1383
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,220
 is a picture of Jesus towards you and towards me.

1384
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,780
 He's a God who says, "This covenant I will never break,

1385
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,280
 "I will never end, no matter what you do,

1386
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,860
 "I am staying in love.

1387
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,860
 "And I made that decision."

1388
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,420
 He's a God who died in your place 2,000 years ago

1389
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,340
 on a cross and he made that ultimate commitment

1390
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,060
 and the covenant was sealed.

1391
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,260
 No matter what you do, if you put your faith in Jesus,

1392
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,540
 you enter into that relationship

1393
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,540
 'cause you're Gomer and so am I.

1394
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,020
 In every different ways that all of us this week sinned

1395
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,340
 and rebelled against God and were selfish and self-seeking

1396
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,220
 and angry and lustful and prideful,

1397
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,820
 all of them he paid for and said, "I'm staying in love

1398
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,480
 "and I'm paying whatever the price.

1399
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,680
 "She's mine, he's mine, they're mine."

1400
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,600
 That's why God cares about staying in love.

1401
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
 He's passionate about it and our hope in this series

1402
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,720
 is that you will learn and marriages will be formed

1403
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,440
 of people who stay in love

1404
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,400
 because they ultimately are in a relationship with the God

1405
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,680
 who through Jesus has promised there's never a moment

1406
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,020
 where he will not be staying in love with them.

1407
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,420
 Let me pray.

1408
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,400
 Father, I've...

1409
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,440
 (sighs)

1410
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:52,700
 God, I just wanna pray for anyone in this room

1411
00:53:52,700 --> 00:54:00,780
 who's never stepped into a relationship with you.

1412
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,400
 The most important relationship that they will ever have

1413
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,200
 is their acceptance or begins with them accepting

1414
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,080
 the free gift that you offered

1415
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,080
 where you extended the invitation to anyone

1416
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,920
 who will accept it.

1417
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,120
 I paid for everything wrong you've ever done,

1418
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,200
 everything all over this room that is representative

1419
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,480
 of the ways that all of us have sinned and fallen short

1420
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,480
 of our standards, of other standards and of your standard.

1421
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,880
 And yet you said despite all of that,

1422
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,600
 you paid for it by dying in our place.

1423
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,780
 Tonight, God, would you allow what the spirit of God

1424
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,520
 only can do, no message, no music, no person could do

1425
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,440
 to allow people to see you're a God who's offered

1426
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,760
 the extension of that love, who stays in love,

1427
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,960
 who's been pursuing every person in this room

1428
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,040
 despite everything wrong, God,

1429
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,680
 from the moment they took their first breath

1430
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,860
 and will be pursuing them

1431
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,600
 to the moment they take their last.

1432
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,200
 Father, I pray for dating relationships

1433
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,940
 and marriages to form out of this room

1434
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,440
 and out of men and women inside of this room

1435
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,800
 who know you and walk with you

1436
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,840
 and they would bring kids into this world

1437
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,920
 who walk with you from an early age, who know you.

1438
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,840
 I pray that you would prevent marriages

1439
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,960
 that do not need to happen.

1440
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,360
 Tonight, breakups would take place all over our country

1441
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,960
 with those who are listening in.

1442
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,440
 And I pray that you'd solidify relationships

1443
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,640
 with people pursuing you and they would feel

1444
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,480
 like despite all the craziness the world says,

1445
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,480
 I can't believe you would date that way.

1446
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,280
 They would feel just a confidence and a peace

1447
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,680
 that comes from knowing that your way leads to life,

1448
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,760
 your ways are not our ways, they're higher, they're better,

1449
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,440
 and they're for our good and we can trust you, God.

1450
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,100
 Help us to be more like Jesus.

1451
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,360
 We need you, God.

1452
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,240
 Take ground in all of our hearts.

1453
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,320
 Start with me.

1454
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,760
 We worship you now in song, amen.
