 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:26,320
 What's up, Porch?

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,800
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,160
 You guys out there just want to make sure.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,120
 How we doing?

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,160
 OK.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,800
 Hey, good to see you.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,720
 If this is your first time ever at the Porch, welcome.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,040
 I am glad you made it.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,680
 Thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,240
 My name is Timothy Atik, and I'm one of the teaching pastors

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,080
 here at Watermark on Sundays, as well as here

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 on Tuesdays at the Porch.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,960
 I want to give a special shout out to all of our Porch Live

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
 locations tuning in at different places in the nation.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
 I'm thinking about Porch Live Cincinnati tonight,

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,880
 Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Scottsdale.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,320
 So glad y'all are tuning in.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,840
 I also just want to give a special hello

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,040
 to our deaf and hard of hearing friends that

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,280
 are in the room tonight.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,960
 So I'm just going to try something new out tonight.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,360
 I don't know how it's going to go,

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,760
 but I'm going to give it a whirl.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
 OK?

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,520
 We are glad that you are here.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,320
 Thanks for coming.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,640
 Hey, I want you to know, let's be clear.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
 If you have any friends that are deaf or hard of hearing,

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
 they belong here at the Porch.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,560
 They belong here, not just on one night, every Tuesday night.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,440
 So make sure that they know that we

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,560
 have a place for them to come and worship with us.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,000
 So several years ago, my wife and I,

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
 we made a very, very unfortunate decision

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
 that I want to share with you tonight.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,960
 We chose to try and fly on an airplane with a small child.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,440
 And that's it.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,520
 That was a poor decision.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,000
 You should never make that decision ever in your life.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
 Because here's the reality.

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,120
 When you are traveling with an infant,

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,440
 you are basically handing that child all of the control.

45
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,760
 And your trip just became one big coin toss, that is.

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,280
 Like, it's a game.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,760
 You're either going to come out a big time winner or a big time

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,260
 loser.

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,400
 And Cat and I, we came out massive losers.

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,240
 We were traveling from Austin to Birmingham, Alabama

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 with our first son Noah, who was about eight months old

52
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
 at the time.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,960
 And we came out major losers.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,840
 It was the type of thing that when we landed in Birmingham,

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
 we felt like we had flown to Europe and had jet lag.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,080
 We were contemplating only vacationing

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,880
 from that point forward in either Waco or San Antonio

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,720
 for about the next 18 years.

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,120
 Because it was so miserable.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
 We were on the flight.

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,120
 And for the majority of the flight,

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,720
 Noah was just losing his ever-loving mind.

63
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
 And we were trying everything that we

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,680
 could to just help him get comfortable and calm down.

65
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,360
 And that just wasn't working.

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,040
 And so it was a frantic situation.

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
 And because it was a frantic situation, I was frantic.

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,160
 And Catherine was frantic.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,280
 So we were frantic individually.

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
 And then we were frantic collectively.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
 And I guess that people around us

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,600
 could tell, because at the end of the flight,

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,240
 a man slid a note through the seat to me.

74
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
 And I opened up the note.

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,560
 And on the note was a drawing.

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
 And the drawing was of a triangle.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,480
 And at the top of the triangle was the word God.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,160
 And then in the two corners was husband and wife.

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
 And then there was a note that said,

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,840
 the closer you get to God, the closer

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,320
 you will get to each other.

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,440
 Now that's an interesting note to get when you're a pastor.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,520
 I don't know what you do with that.

84
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,880
 I was like, no duh, sign Pastor Timothy Attiq.

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
 And I folded up and handed it back.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,160
 No, I'm just kidding.

87
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
 But when I think about that experience, here's the reality.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
 That guy was watching us.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,880
 And at least in that moment, that guy

90
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
 could not see Jesus at work in my life.

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,080
 That's what you call, at least for that moment,

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,560
 that's what you call hypocrisy.

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
 Hypocrisy is knowing the truth and not living the truth.

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,280
 At least in that moment, I was struggling

95
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,040
 as a pastor with hypocrisy.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,840
 I was a person that knew Jesus, but I wasn't living like I did.

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,800
 I knew the truth, but I wasn't living the truth.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,360
 There was information here, but there was no application here.

99
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,600
 And I tell you that because, hey, here's the reality.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
 If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,880
 we're all going to have times in our lives

102
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,040
 where we struggle with hypocrisy.

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
 And if you're not a Christian and you're like,

104
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,440
 that's why I'm not a Christian,

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
 because when you look at different Christians,

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,040
 you're like, sometimes what you say you believe

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,560
 doesn't match how you live.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
 And so I'll just apologize on behalf of all Christians.

109
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
 It's something that we're going to be working on

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,920
 for the rest of our lives.

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,440
 We never claim to be perfect.

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,040
 We only claim to know the one who is perfect,

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,280
 and that's Jesus Christ, who came

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,920
 and he was perfect in our place.

115
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,800
 And he made a way when there was no way

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,720
 for very imperfect people to be made right

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,400
 with a perfect God.

118
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,960
 But the reality is that we're all going to have times

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,880
 where what we know doesn't match how we live.

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,000
 So if you think back to science in high school,

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,640
 if you think about the classroom

122
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 and you think about the lab,

123
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,920
 if Tuesday nights are the classroom

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
 and the rest of the week is the lab

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 where we go out and live what we learned in the classroom,

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,480
 sometimes we struggle in the lab.

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,440
 Interestingly, as we step back

128
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,320
 into the book of Ecclesiastes tonight,

129
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,760
 and we listen to the wisest man to ever walk the face

130
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,040
 of the earth besides Jesus Christ,

131
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,880
 as we listen to the words of King Solomon,

132
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
 you know what he's gonna say?

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,280
 He's gonna say, "Hey, the problem goes even deeper.

134
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,960
 "The issue isn't just that we struggle in the lab.

135
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
 "We can actually struggle in the classroom."

136
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,560
 So we don't just struggle with hypocrisy sometimes

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,080
 when we go out and live out the rest of our weeks.

138
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 We can actually struggle with hypocrisy

139
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
 doing what we're doing right now,

140
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,640
 like when we gather together on Sundays for worship

141
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,760
 or we gather together on Tuesday nights for the porch.

142
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,760
 And so tonight is gonna be a very unique type of message.

143
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,560
 Like it might throw some of you off

144
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,760
 because you're kind of looking for the truth

145
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,480
 that you need to go out and live.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,320
 And I'm actually gonna talk about the truth

147
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
 that you need to come in and apply

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,440
 when you come to the porch or you come to church.

149
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,480
 Like I wanna talk about Solomon

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,480
 as he's going to instruct us in how we live here.

151
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
 Because here's the reality,

152
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,760
 God cares a lot about what is happening right now

153
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
 on Tuesday night.

154
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,400
 He cares a lot about what is going on with you

155
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,280
 in this moment.

156
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
 He cares deeply about it.

157
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,500
 And so tonight might feel a little bit uncomfortable

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,960
 because we're gonna talk about the hypocrisy

159
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,720
 that might even be happening in our lives

160
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,320
 and in our hearts right now, right this second.

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 And that's okay.

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,640
 Because while we wanna identify the hypocrisy,

163
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,440
 like we have an opportunity even in this moment to pivot

164
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,560
 and move towards authenticity in relating to God

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,880
 even right now.

166
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,260
 So because this is gonna be a different type of message,

167
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,520
 here's what I wanna do.

168
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,160
 I wanna ask everyone in the room to take a moment

169
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
 and just pray for yourself.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
 Just real quick, take a second and just say,

171
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,900
 "God, would you speak to me tonight?"

172
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
 Just pray those words,

173
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,080
 "God, please speak to me tonight."

174
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:26,640
 Lord, I pray that you would do just that.

175
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,800
 That our ears would be open,

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
 that our hearts would be receptive

177
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,360
 to whatever you wanna say to us.

178
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,680
 Speak to us now in Jesus' name, amen.

179
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
 Hey, if you're here and you're not a Christian,

180
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
 this is actually a great night for you to be here

181
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
 because tonight you're really gonna at least

182
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,160
 get an explanation for why we're even doing this.

183
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,120
 Like why thousands of young adults

184
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
 chose to get all of their steps

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,300
 in just walking from the parking garage

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,680
 to this building tonight.

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,600
 Like what's the point?

188
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
 Why are we doing this?

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,240
 You're gonna find that out right now.

190
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
 If you have a Bible, turn with me to Ecclesiastes.

191
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,360
 Chapter five, Ecclesiastes chapter five.

192
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,280
 We're gonna be looking tonight at verses one through seven.

193
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 King Solomon is going to address how we worship

194
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,520
 when we come together on Tuesdays and Sundays.

195
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,760
 Here's what he says.

196
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,820
 Verse one of chapter five, he says,

197
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,820
 "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God

198
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,860
 "to draw near to listen is better than to offer

199
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,360
 "the sacrifice of fools,

200
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
 "for they do not know that they are doing evil.

201
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
 "Be not rash with your mouth,

202
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,780
 "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God.

203
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,620
 "For God is in heaven and you are on earth,

204
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,900
 "therefore let your words be few.

205
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,020
 "For a dream comes with much business

206
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,040
 "in a fool's voice with many words.

207
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,640
 "When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it,

208
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,440
 "for he has no pleasure in fools.

209
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,180
 "Pay what you vow.

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,880
 "It's better that you should not vow

211
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,520
 "than that you should vow and not pay.

212
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Let not your mouth lead you into sin

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,080
 "and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake.

214
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
 "Why should God be angry at your voice

215
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,780
 "and destroy the work of your hands?

216
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,620
 "For when dreams increase and words grow many,

217
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,080
 "there is vanity, but God is the one you must fear."

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,040
 Solomon is targeting our hypocrisy

219
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,840
 when we come together to worship.

220
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,240
 So tonight what I wanna do is I wanna look at this passage

221
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,280
 and give you five keys to moving away from hypocrisy

222
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,640
 and moving towards authenticity

223
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,240
 when we come together to worship.

224
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,960
 Okay, the first key is this,

225
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,960
 true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.

226
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,860
 True worship, when we come together, when we sing,

227
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,280
 when we open up the Bible,

228
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,280
 true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.

229
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 Look again at what Solomon says in verse one.

230
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,980
 He says, "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God."

231
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,040
 Why is he saying that?

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
 All he's saying is,

233
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,800
 "Hey, when you come to the porch on Tuesday nights,

234
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,460
 "think about what you're doing.

235
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,980
 "Be careful, take caution.

236
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,680
 "Don't go into the porch flippantly."

237
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
 Why?

238
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,140
 Because God cares what is happening here.

239
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,600
 God cares about it.

240
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,360
 God cares about the quality of our worship.

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
 And then he goes on in verse one

242
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,760
 and look at what he says.

243
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,920
 The wording is very important.

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 He says, "To draw near to listen is better."

245
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
 It's better than what?

246
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,760
 It's better than to offer the sacrifice of fools.

247
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,000
 And so Solomon is basically saying,

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,240
 "Hey, there's two different ways to worship

249
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,580
 "on a Tuesday night or a Sunday morning,

250
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,960
 "and one is much better than the other."

251
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,920
 The better way, the true worship,

252
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,560
 is one where when you come on Tuesday night,

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,880
 you are drawing near.

254
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,180
 The wording is you are drawing near to listen.

255
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,920
 The question you should be asking right now

256
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,660
 is to listen to who?

257
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,640
 Like just evaluate, who did you come here tonight to hear?

258
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,480
 Like it is our conviction here at the porch.

259
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,440
 And I think what Solomon is getting at

260
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
 is when you gather together,

261
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,900
 you come with the conviction that God is here.

262
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,040
 God is here and he wants to speak to you.

263
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,560
 Did you come tonight with the expectation

264
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
 that the God of the universe

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,640
 actually wants to speak into your heart tonight?

266
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,400
 The reason that we teach the Bible every single week

267
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
 is that we believe that this book

268
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,640
 is actually the word of God.

269
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,480
 Like God went to great lengths to give it to us

270
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,940
 so that he could speak to us through it

271
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,600
 as we open it and study it together.

272
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so we are convinced that God is here.

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
 He wants to meet with us.

274
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,880
 He wants to speak to you and to me.

275
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,600
 And yet we can often come together and worship

276
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,900
 for other reasons than to hear from God.

277
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,420
 I remember years ago when I was in my early 20s,

278
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,680
 my best friend and I,

279
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,480
 we decided to drive out to Denton to a church

280
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 where Tommy Nelson,

281
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,080
 who spoke at the beginning of the Ecclesiastes series,

282
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,680
 we drove out to his church.

283
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,080
 We had heard a lot of great things about Tommy Nelson.

284
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 We totally wanted to hear him.

285
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,360
 So we made the 45 minute drive out there

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,280
 and we sat through the worship.

287
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 And then someone other than Tommy Nelson got up to speak.

288
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,820
 And when that guy got up, we got up.

289
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,280
 And now like I cringe thinking about it,

290
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
 doing what I'm doing right now.

291
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,540
 'Cause that guy got up, everyone is seated,

292
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,600
 everything's quiet and we're like,

293
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
 yeah, it's time to go to dinner.

294
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,960
 So we stood up and we left.

295
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,080
 Why?

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,480
 We weren't there to hear from God.

297
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,220
 We were there to hear from Tommy Nelson.

298
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,600
 So my question to you is,

299
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,560
 who did you come here tonight to hear from?

300
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,260
 Did you come to hear from me?

301
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,920
 Did you come to hear from the porch band?

302
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,840
 Some of y'all are like, I didn't come to hear from anyone.

303
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,160
 I came to meet someone and her name or his name

304
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,340
 is not Jesus.

305
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,740
 And that's fine.

306
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,400
 Like if that's what God you hear,

307
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,160
 hey, I'm glad you made it.

308
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 And I hope that that works out for you.

309
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,680
 But now that you're here,

310
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,360
 let me just encourage you to trade up.

311
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,920
 Trade up to an even better meeting.

312
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,880
 Like trade up from something natural

313
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,840
 to something supernatural.

314
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,020
 Where the Lord of Lords and King of Kings

315
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,720
 actually wants to meet you tonight

316
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,520
 and wants to speak to your heart.

317
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 Who did you come to hear?

318
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
 I'll just say this.

319
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,840
 One of my concerns with your generation

320
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
 is that we live in a time

321
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,480
 where Christians are being celebritized.

322
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,200
 Like we are turning normal followers of Jesus

323
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 into celebrities.

324
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
 But I don't find that anywhere in the Bible.

325
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,500
 Like when I look in the book of Acts,

326
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,760
 which is where the people who started the church,

327
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,960
 like if anyone was going to be a Christian celebrity,

328
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,840
 it would be the guys that got this thing kicked off.

329
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,680
 It's the guys that, like Peter, when he spoke,

330
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,280
 3,000 people became Christians just like that, one message.

331
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,400
 And yet when I look at these guys,

332
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,020
 these guys aren't being exalted.

333
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,120
 These guys are getting stoned.

334
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,120
 And I'm not talking about that type of stone.

335
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,760
 Some of y'all, for a minute there,

336
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,520
 you were like, the Bible has never made more sense to me

337
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
 than right now.

338
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,060
 That's not what I'm talking about.

339
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,920
 I'm talking about rocks being thrown.

340
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
 Enough of them that the people throwing them

341
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,240
 think that the people they're throwing them at are dead.

342
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,200
 And then those people that they think are dead,

343
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,400
 once the stone throwers are gone,

344
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,440
 they just get up and move to the next town

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,600
 and keep preaching the gospel.

346
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,640
 And many of them ended up dying for preaching the gospel.

347
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,600
 And yet we find ourselves in this point in history

348
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,160
 where there's a lot of podcasting,

349
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,080
 there's a lot of following and reposting,

350
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,800
 and there's a lot of church hopping where it's like,

351
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,840
 where are the best speakers speaking?

352
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
 And you hear that someone's gonna be here,

353
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,520
 and so you go and listen to that.

354
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,560
 And there's a lot of listening,

355
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,120
 and there's a lot of celebritizing.

356
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,720
 But there's little life change.

357
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,240
 And so let me just encourage you,

358
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,600
 don't turn messengers into messiahs.

359
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
 They are terrible messiahs.

360
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,960
 They are sinners just like you and me.

361
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,600
 They are trying to follow Jesus one day at a time

362
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
 just like you and me.

363
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,560
 God has given them something to steward.

364
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,280
 God has entrusted them with a gift,

365
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,280
 and that gift exists for them to glorify Christ.

366
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,480
 And so join them as they seek to glorify Christ,

367
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,520
 but don't glorify them as they glorify Christ.

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
 Don't be more in tune

369
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,440
 with what your favorite Christian celebrity is saying

370
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,560
 than what the word of God says.

371
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,240
 'Cause in the end, when you stand before Jesus,

372
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,160
 it's not gonna work for you to be like,

373
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
 well, you know what JP says?

374
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,560
 Jesus is gonna be like, yeah, I know him.

375
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,880
 Do you know me?

376
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
 Okay.

377
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,280
 So what's the better way?

378
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 What did we say?

379
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,280
 We said true worship ascribes worth to God, not man.

380
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:57,520
 The word worship descends from a Saxon word

381
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,040
 that eventually became the word worth-ship,

382
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,200
 which I think is really telling about what true worship is

383
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,800
 because true worship is ascribing the proper worth to God.

384
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,360
 So when we come to the porch to worship,

385
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,320
 here's what we're saying.

386
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,960
 We're saying, Jesus Christ, you're worth it.

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,680
 You're worth it for me to park in that parking garage

388
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,120
 on the third story and walk down all those stairs

389
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,640
 and across the parking lot.

390
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
 You're worth it.

391
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,800
 You're worth it for me to fight traffic.

392
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,000
 You're worth it for me to skip dinner

393
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,960
 because I was running late out of work.

394
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,160
 You're worth it for me to put work on hold

395
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,200
 for a couple of hours.

396
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,080
 You're worth it for me to come into this place

397
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,360
 and find a seat.

398
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
 You're worth it for me to tune everything else

399
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
 out in my life.

400
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,320
 You're worth it for me to put my phone on do not disturb.

401
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,000
 You are worth it for me to lift my hands in praise

402
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
 or to get on my knees.

403
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,740
 You are worth all of it.

404
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,640
 That's who you are.

405
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,840
 You are worthy of it.

406
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
 You are worth it.

407
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 That's what we wanna do when we gather together here.

408
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,720
 We're not just here to like have a big event

409
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,480
 to see how many people we can get into this place

410
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,120
 'cause if we all gather together

411
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,400
 and we all snap a picture that we were here

412
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,040
 but no one seeks Jesus more,

413
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,380
 this was a royal waste of time.

414
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,840
 And so we are here to meet with God.

415
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,920
 Here's the reality.

416
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
 If the God of the universe wants to speak to me,

417
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,480
 I don't wanna hear from anyone else.

418
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,980
 And I hope that that's true for you as well.

419
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,040
 Think about this.

420
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,020
 What will your story be tonight?

421
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,720
 Like when you leave here and you go home,

422
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
 if you walk in and your roommate was like,

423
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,240
 what'd you do tonight?

424
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,160
 Like your story could be, you know what?

425
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,080
 I had an encounter with the God of the universe.

426
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
 What have you been up to?

427
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,160
 That's a pretty good story.

428
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,800
 It's a pretty good night.

429
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,860
 True worship ascribes worth to God, not man.

430
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,800
 Number two, true worship has no autopilot.

431
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,840
 True worship has no autopilot.

432
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,900
 Like we are not trying to compete with Tesla here.

433
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,560
 Tesla is trying to make life efficient.

434
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,900
 You can push a button and the car will drive itself

435
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
 so you can do whatever you want.

436
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,100
 Autopilot enables you to multitask, to do other things.

437
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,940
 That doesn't work when it comes to worship.

438
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,780
 True worship has no autopilot.

439
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,120
 Look again at Solomon's wording in verse one.

440
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,620
 He says, "To draw near to listen is better than," what?

441
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,180
 "It's better than to offer the sacrifice of fools,"

442
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,220
 which begs the question, what's the sacrifice of fools?

443
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,620
 Well, the sacrifice of fools is simply the opposite

444
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,560
 of drawing near to listen.

445
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,800
 So if God is here and he wants to meet with us,

446
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,260
 if he wants to speak to us,

447
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,960
 then the sacrifice of fools must be going to all the effort

448
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
 to come into this place and leaving.

449
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,340
 Like you walk across the parking lot, you find your seat,

450
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,660
 you sit for an hour and a half,

451
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,380
 and then you walk back across the parking lot

452
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,140
 and you sit through traffic and you never meet with God.

453
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,100
 That's the sacrifice of fools.

454
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 Here's the reality.

455
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,500
 It's a lot easier than you think

456
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,620
 to offer the sacrifice of fools.

457
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,620
 I'm a pastor and I am confessing that over the years,

458
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,980
 there have been plenty of times where I've gone to church

459
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,500
 and gotten nothing out of it,

460
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,180
 and it has been 100% my fault.

461
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,860
 'Cause the worship has been great, that's not the issue.

462
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,280
 People have been preaching the word of God faithfully,

463
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,980
 they've been proclaiming the gospel.

464
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,420
 The issue hasn't been with what's going on,

465
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,140
 it's been with what's going on with me.

466
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,620
 So what can it look like to offer the sacrifice of fools

467
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,460
 here at the porch?

468
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,280
 Well, what it looks like is you're coming in hot,

469
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,180
 the first song has started,

470
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,420
 and so it takes you kind of the first song

471
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,100
 to text your friends and to find your seat

472
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,940
 and to just get settled.

473
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,860
 And then the second song gets going,

474
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,220
 and you click into autopilot worship pretty quickly,

475
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,780
 which is amazing,

476
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,260
 because you will be singing every word to every song

477
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,500
 while your mind is somewhere totally different.

478
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,620
 Like you can be singing every word and you're like,

479
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,740
 oh my gosh, I've got so much to do tonight

480
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
 and I'm way behind on laundry and I haven't eaten,

481
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,540
 so where am I gonna eat tonight?

482
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,660
 And it really bothers me that she said that

483
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,380
 and I can't believe that he did that and she's wearing that,

484
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,100
 that's crazy, and he's good looking,

485
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,580
 and your brain can be everywhere

486
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,600
 while you are singing every word to every song,

487
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,820
 that's autopilot worship.

488
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,500
 And then we pray and then I come up

489
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,140
 and I've got about one or two minutes

490
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,660
 to captivate your attention before some of y'all be like,

491
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,060
 you know, he's not that funny tonight

492
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,020
 and I don't know if I'm really feeling

493
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,000
 what he's talking about,

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,380
 so maybe this is a good time for me to leave

495
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,220
 because I still do have all that work

496
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,020
 and it would be nice to get a jump on my laundry

497
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,100
 and if you stick it out and I pray

498
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,740
 and then we get into the response song,

499
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,060
 you're like, now's my time to get a jump on traffic.

500
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,340
 If I don't leave now and get out of here early,

501
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,940
 I'm gonna be sitting in a line out of that parking garage.

502
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,060
 And so from the time you got here to the time you leave,

503
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,820
 nothing happens, there's no connection with God.

504
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,620
 What a waste of a night.

505
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,400
 What a waste of a night.

506
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,620
 It's not worth it, there's something

507
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,660
 so much better here for you.

508
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,460
 Like we're just inviting you to reject autopilot worship,

509
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,940
 why, because the Lord of Lords and King of Kings is here.

510
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,060
 He wants to meet with us, he wants to speak to you.

511
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,980
 So we're just inviting you in to more.

512
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,860
 Number three.

513
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,180
 True worship is honest, it's honest.

514
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,080
 Look back at what Solomon says in verses two and three.

515
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,380
 He says this, "Be not rash with your mouth,

516
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,920
 "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God,

517
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,420
 "for God is in heaven and you are on earth.

518
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,220
 "Therefore let your words be few,

519
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,960
 "for a dream comes with much business

520
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,860
 "and a fool's voice with many voices."

521
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,200
 So Solomon is now targeting the words

522
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,740
 that actually come out of our mouths

523
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,020
 when we are singing songs together on a Tuesday night

524
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,500
 or on Sunday morning, and here's his point.

525
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 Because you are talking to God, think before you speak.

526
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,920
 Because God actually cares about the words

527
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,060
 coming out of your mouth.

528
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,440
 Like he cares what we say in this moment.

529
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,760
 God is most glorified when what comes out of our mouth

530
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,320
 on Tuesday nights or Sunday mornings is honest.

531
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,680
 That we aren't saying things that aren't actually true.

532
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,560
 But here's the thing, if we're not careful,

533
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,760
 then we might find ourselves in an emotional moment

534
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,200
 just saying something that we don't actually believe.

535
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,520
 It's kind of like this.

536
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,880
 Like some of y'all might find yourself

537
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,280
 in a dating relationship where y'all kind of

538
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,880
 jump headfirst into this thing,

539
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,440
 and it gets very serious very quickly.

540
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,240
 Where you guys are spending all of your time together

541
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,380
 every single day, and it gets very physical

542
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,920
 and very emotional very quickly.

543
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,840
 And so some of y'all might find yourself

544
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,220
 a month into dating, and it's late at night,

545
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,640
 and you're having this very physical,

546
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,160
 very emotional moment, and the only thing

547
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,000
 that seems right to say in that moment is,

548
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I love you, and as it comes out of your mouth,

549
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 you're like, no, but it's already out.

550
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,720
 And then in the morning, you wake up

551
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,840
 and check your phone, and it's like,

552
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,560
 I love you, my perfect man, and you're like,

553
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,800
 gosh, that escalated quickly.

554
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,660
 And you said something in an emotional moment

555
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,760
 that you didn't actually believe.

556
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,680
 Some of y'all are like, you are in my head.

557
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,320
 (congregation laughing)

558
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,200
 I can't help you with that situation,

559
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,260
 but when it comes to what's happening in here,

560
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,960
 maybe I can come down afterward, we'll talk about it.

561
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,660
 But here's the thing, the same thing can happen here.

562
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,520
 I mean, we've got this massive LED screen,

563
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,640
 we've got lights, we've got smoke,

564
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,120
 we've got an amazing band that leads us,

565
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,340
 amazing worship leaders.

566
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,700
 It's loud, there's energy, look around,

567
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,700
 and everyone's got their hands raised.

568
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,320
 And in that moment, it can be so emotional

569
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,800
 that you find yourself singing words to songs

570
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,560
 that you don't actually believe.

571
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,440
 I mean, just think about what we have sang tonight.

572
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,120
 Like one of the songs that we sang tonight,

573
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,280
 here's what we said.

574
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,900
 We said, oh, I'm not here for blessings.

575
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,120
 Jesus, you don't owe me anything.

576
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,100
 And more than anything you can do, I just want you.

577
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,320
 I just want you.

578
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,460
 Is that like nothing else?

579
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,980
 It says nothing else, nothing else will do,

580
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,060
 I just want you.

581
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,780
 Is that what you really believe?

582
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,900
 Like I don't want anything else.

583
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,440
 Like Jesus, if you don't give me another thing in my life,

584
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,700
 if you don't give me a boyfriend or girlfriend,

585
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,260
 if you don't give me a job, it doesn't matter

586
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,200
 because the thing that I want most is you.

587
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,760
 Or maybe the right words instead of nothing else,

588
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,880
 it was something else, something else will do,

589
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,280
 but it's not you.

590
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,360
 You know, maybe that was more what we,

591
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,780
 if we were honest.

592
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,760
 Or like this, and I don't know if this is gonna connect

593
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,600
 with you guys or not, but over the years,

594
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,040
 do you wanna know what song people have messaged me,

595
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,040
 asked me about the most, asking if we could sing it

596
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,380
 in the different ministries I've led,

597
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,600
 do you wanna know what the number one song is?

598
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,540
 Over the years of working with college students,

599
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,380
 do you know what it is?

600
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,600
 It's the song "Oceans."

601
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,920
 I don't know if you remember the song "Oceans."

602
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,800
 Some of y'all, if we sang "Oceans," you would be wrecked.

603
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,280
 You would just be weeping.

604
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,300
 You'd just be on the floor.

605
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 (congregation laughing)

606
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 But I want you to think about what you're singing

607
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 when you sing "Oceans."

608
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,180
 Here's the words.

609
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,180
 Spirit, lead me where my trust is without borders.

610
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,780
 Let me walk upon the waters wherever you would call me.

611
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,860
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander,

612
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,740
 and my faith will be made stronger

613
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,000
 in the presence of my Savior.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,260
 Do you understand what you're saying?

615
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,580
 You're saying, "God, I want you to take me to a place

616
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,720
 "where I don't know what's happening.

617
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,800
 "It's very, like, it's unpredictable.

618
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,060
 "It can feel unstable.

619
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,700
 "I can't see the result.

620
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,020
 "I can't see how things are gonna turn out.

621
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,900
 "I can't see if all my dreams are gonna be fulfilled,

622
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,260
 "but I'm there, and you're there,

623
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,140
 "and that's all that matters, and that's all I want.

624
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,020
 "I just wanna be led by you.

625
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,460
 "I just want you, but right now,

626
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,800
 "I just want you to lead me

627
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,420
 "where my trust is without borders."

628
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,020
 Is that really what you want?

629
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,580
 If so, awesome, that's a great song to sing.

630
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,880
 That's a great prayer to pray.

631
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,460
 But what we don't want is you've got the lights,

632
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,900
 and you've got the screens, and so you're like,

633
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,020
 "Yeah, I guess so, yeah, let's do it."

634
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,860
 And then you walk out, and you're like, "Not exactly that."

635
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,740
 You know what I wonder is sometimes

636
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,100
 the most worshipful thing we can do

637
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,940
 during the time of singing is to just be honest with God,

638
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,240
 like to just look at the words and to just say,

639
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
 "God, I don't think I'm there yet,

640
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,740
 "but I wanna get there."

641
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,840
 Or maybe, "God, you know what, I'm singing this,

642
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,020
 "not because it's true now,

643
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,040
 "but because I'm singing it in faith

644
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,180
 "that you, by the power of your Spirit,

645
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,500
 "could help it become true."

646
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,900
 Or what would it look like, honestly,

647
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,620
 for you to say, "God, I need you to know

648
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,060
 "for the last 10 minutes, I've only been thinking

649
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,540
 "about what other people are thinking about me,

650
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,020
 "because we all think that everyone

651
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
 "is always looking at us.

652
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,620
 "And so, honestly, I've been singing and worshiping

653
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,940
 "for the approval of other people,

654
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,020
 "that other people would look at me

655
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,740
 "and think that I'm one of the spiritual people in the room."

656
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,900
 Or what would it look like to just be honest and say,

657
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,360
 "God, I'm playing games with you,

658
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,920
 "because I want something from you.

659
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,200
 "So I feel like if I get here and I go

660
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,960
 "to all the effort to be here and I sing passionately,

661
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,420
 "then you're finally gonna give me what I'm asking for."

662
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,620
 Or maybe, what if you were just honest and say,

663
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,620
 "God, I feel so much guilt, I feel so much shame,

664
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,600
 "I feel so unworthy of being here.

665
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,180
 "I feel like you don't wanna have anything to do with me,

666
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,860
 "so how could I even begin to sing these songs?

667
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,940
 "Would you do something in my life?

668
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,620
 "Would you forgive me?

669
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,200
 "Would you wash me clean?

670
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,580
 "Would you give me a new start?"

671
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,580
 That's honest, that is worship.

672
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,660
 That is true worship.

673
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,820
 Solomon's message is, "Hey, think before you speak.

674
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,180
 "Think before you speak."

675
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,020
 Why?

676
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,500
 Look back at the wording.

677
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,560
 What does he say?

678
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,020
 He says, "Be not rash," this is verse two,

679
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,180
 "Be not rash with your mouth,

680
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,180
 "nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God."

681
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,020
 Why?

682
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,060
 "For God is in heaven and you are on earth."

683
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,700
 He's just saying, "Hey, don't be too casual

684
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,100
 "when you're talking to the God of the universe."

685
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,260
 Sometimes the best thing we can do

686
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,100
 when we come into a moment like this is to just pause.

687
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,820
 That's why every Tuesday night,

688
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
 I don't know if you've noticed it,

689
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,200
 but one of the worship leaders, whenever we start,

690
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,560
 they always just give a moment.

691
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,580
 If you could just be quiet before the Lord, why?

692
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,860
 It's a great opportunity to just remind yourself

693
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,780
 of who you're meeting with.

694
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,340
 You're reminding yourself of who you're talking to.

695
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,720
 So it's good to remind yourself that our God is Father,

696
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,740
 Son, and Holy Spirit.

697
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,400
 He's a perfect Father who is loving and forgiving,

698
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,420
 and he delights in meeting with his children.

699
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,460
 He's Jesus.

700
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,540
 He's Savior.

701
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,380
 He's friend.

702
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,620
 God is Holy Spirit, which means he's counselor and helper.

703
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,860
 And at the exact same time,

704
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,500
 Jesus is also the King of kings and Lord of lords.

705
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,540
 And the God that we're meeting with is the same God

706
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,660
 that the nation of Israel met with

707
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,860
 at the base of Mount Sinai.

708
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,820
 I don't know if you've ever read this in the Old Testament,

709
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,300
 but God speaks from the mountain.

710
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,620
 And the nation of Israel hears God speak audibly,

711
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,900
 and for them, it is a near-death experience.

712
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,260
 They run to Moses and they're like,

713
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,020
 "If God speaks again, I don't think we're gonna live,

714
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,920
 "so here's the deal.

715
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,300
 "We trust you.

716
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,100
 "You go talk to God for us."

717
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,940
 Good luck with that.

718
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,320
 "You go talk to him, and then you come back

719
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,540
 "and tell us what he says."

720
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,900
 It's the same God that John in Revelation,

721
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,160
 when he sees Jesus, he falls on his face,

722
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,420
 and he's like, "I think I'm dead."

723
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,620
 And Jesus is like, "You're not dead, man.

724
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,460
 "Get up."

725
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,500
 [congregation laughing]

726
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,580
 It's the same God.

727
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,540
 He's loving, forgiving, gracious.

728
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,540
 And at the same time, he is holy, holy, holy.

729
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,940
 So I'm gonna put this on the screen

730
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,220
 because I don't want you to miss it.

731
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,220
 Okay, because God is holy,

732
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,700
 because he is holy,

733
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,180
 because he is holy, holy, holy,

734
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,120
 let your words be few and sincere

735
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,400
 instead of many and fake.

736
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,260
 Okay, because God is holy, holy, holy,

737
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,060
 let your words be few and sincere

738
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,040
 instead of many and fake.

739
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,860
 Number four, true worship impacts tomorrow.

740
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,100
 It changes tomorrow.

741
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,620
 Look at what Solomon goes on to say in verse four.

742
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,100
 It says, "When you vow a vow to God,

743
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,940
 "do not delay paying it,

744
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,840
 "for he has no pleasure in fools.

745
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,860
 "Pay what you vow.

746
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,520
 "It's better that you should not vow

747
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,240
 "than that you should vow and not pay.

748
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
 "Let not your mouth lead you into sin.

749
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,120
 "Don't say before the messenger that it was a mistake.

750
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,820
 "Why should God be angry at your voice

751
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,400
 "and destroy the work of your hands?"

752
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,060
 Here's what he's saying.

753
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,100
 He's saying, "Do what you say you're going to do

754
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,940
 "and do it quickly."

755
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,620
 So here's what's really happening.

756
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,440
 Don't miss this.

757
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,480
 This is so important.

758
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,780
 There's gonna be times where you come into this place

759
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,260
 and you're meeting with God

760
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,620
 and you're gonna sense that God is calling you

761
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,920
 to do something very important.

762
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,540
 He's gonna call you to do something important.

763
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,940
 So maybe even tonight you sense

764
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,780
 like you came into this place kind of one foot in

765
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,740
 and one foot out of Christianity.

766
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,580
 Maybe you've put Jesus on the back burner of your life

767
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,540
 and you just sense that Jesus is reaching into your life

768
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,220
 saying, "You're with me.

769
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,020
 "Go all in with me.

770
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,200
 "Surrender fully to me.

771
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,200
 "I want you and I want you, all of you to come with me."

772
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,440
 Or maybe you sense that God is reaching in just saying,

773
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,040
 "It's time to get out of that toxic, unhealthy relationship."

774
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,440
 Or maybe you sense that God is calling you

775
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,640
 to go on the mission field.

776
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,360
 Or maybe you sense that God is calling you

777
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,480
 to forgive someone that you've harbored bitterness,

778
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,440
 anger, and resentment towards for years.

779
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,380
 Maybe you sense that he's finally calling you

780
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,540
 out of an addiction to pornography.

781
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,920
 So you need to go to Regen on Monday night

782
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,280
 or go to Courageous Hope if you're a woman

783
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,420
 who's experienced sexual abuse.

784
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,700
 Or maybe you need to go to one of the other ministries here,

785
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,440
 Divorce Care, if you're a single mom in the room.

786
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,340
 Or Grief Share if you've lost a loved one.

787
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,020
 Or maybe he's calling you out of isolation

788
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,500
 and he's calling you to membership here at Watermark

789
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,820
 or to get into a community group.

790
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,620
 And here's the thing, God, in moments like this,

791
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,900
 he can be very clear.

792
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,780
 And as he speaks into our lives,

793
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,700
 we might find ourselves in the moment saying,

794
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,340
 "Yes, God, I want to go all in with you.

795
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,300
 Yes, I agree I need to get out of this relationship.

796
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,620
 Yes, God, I want to do what you're asking me to do."

797
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,860
 But if we don't go and do it quickly,

798
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,180
 then a fog can kind of roll into our minds

799
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,500
 and our enemies, Satan, can begin to lie to us.

800
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,780
 And he can tell us things like,

801
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,580
 "Can you really imagine your life

802
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,140
 without him or her in it?

803
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,380
 Can you imagine how much you would be acquiescing

804
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,540
 if you went and forgave that person who hurt you?

805
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,540
 Can you imagine what people would think of you

806
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,260
 if you confessed that sin?"

807
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,980
 And so we might find ourselves in a place

808
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,660
 where a yes in here becomes a no out there.

809
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,580
 So just think real quick.

810
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,880
 Is there anything that you've already agreed with God on?

811
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,380
 At some point in the past,

812
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,060
 like God has called you to do something

813
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,700
 and you said yes to it in a moment like this,

814
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,220
 and yet the yes in here became a no out there.

815
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,860
 If there's anything that comes to mind,

816
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,140
 look, there is grace.

817
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,700
 You don't need to feel shame.

818
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,740
 But my encouragement to you is to just take seriously

819
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,220
 the words of verse four.

820
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,260
 Let me read it again.

821
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,080
 "When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it,

822
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,380
 for he has no pleasure in fools.

823
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,640
 Pay what you vow."

824
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,740
 Pay what you vow.

825
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,320
 Do what you say that you are going to do.

826
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,620
 You know what unbelievers need to see in Christians?

827
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,280
 Like, I think that a lot of people who don't know Jesus,

828
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,480
 they don't wanna know Jesus

829
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,240
 because they look at the Christians and they see hypocrisy.

830
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,220
 But do you wanna know what the unbelievers at your work

831
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,740
 or at your gym or at your apartment complex need to see?

832
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,860
 You know what they need to see?

833
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,940
 They need to see Jesus changing your life.

834
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,580
 I'm not talking about you just going out

835
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,420
 and trying to muscle up and be better.

836
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,520
 No, I'm talking about you every day

837
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,300
 just surrendering to Jesus, you leaving here tonight,

838
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,840
 just saying yes to Jesus and whatever he's calling you to.

839
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,080
 That begins to change you.

840
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,280
 When I say that true worship impacts tomorrow,

841
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,040
 I'm talking about getting up tomorrow

842
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,600
 and your yes tonight still being a yes in the morning.

843
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,260
 Unbelievers need to see that Jesus actually is

844
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,520
 in the business of changing lives.

845
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,880
 Because when unbelievers look into your life

846
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,920
 and they see more peace, more joy, more selflessness,

847
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,360
 more freedom than an invitation to the porch

848
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,720
 or an invitation to churches,

849
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,900
 it's no longer an invitation to come hear music

850
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,680
 and a message.

851
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,940
 It's an invitation to meet Jesus

852
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,100
 who is in the business of changing lives.

853
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,720
 The final key to stepping away from hypocrisy

854
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,800
 and taking a step towards authenticity

855
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,920
 in a moment like this is this true worship

856
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,800
 is how we say thank you to Jesus.

857
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,440
 It's how we say thank you to Jesus.

858
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,920
 I just want to be very clear.

859
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,160
 This message, I told you all from the beginning,

860
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,580
 this is going to be a unique message.

861
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,960
 It's going to feel different

862
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
 because we're talking about what we're doing right now.

863
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,960
 My goal of this message isn't to introduce

864
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,360
 more restrictions into our worship.

865
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,740
 It's to introduce more reverence,

866
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,760
 more gratitude, and more authenticity.

867
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,680
 So remember why Jesus went to the cross.

868
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,520
 This is the key.

869
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,880
 Remember why Jesus Christ went to the cross.

870
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,640
 And if you're not a Christian, here it is.

871
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,400
 This is the point of Christianity.

872
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,520
 The point of Christianity is not bad people

873
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,320
 trying to become good people or moral people

874
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,080
 trying to be morally superior to other people.

875
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,540
 That's not Christianity.

876
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,760
 This is Christianity, 1 Peter 3:18.

877
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,760
 For Christ, Jesus Christ, also suffered once for sins,

878
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,200
 the righteous for the unrighteous.

879
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,520
 The righteous, that's Jesus Christ, perfect Son of God.

880
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,400
 The unrighteous, that's us, imperfect human beings.

881
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,240
 Why?

882
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,280
 Why did he do that?

883
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,160
 Why did Jesus go to the cross and suffer,

884
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
 which means he went to the cross

885
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,040
 and he was punished for all of our sins,

886
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,600
 all of our imperfection.

887
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,480
 He did it that he might bring us to God.

888
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,800
 That's it.

889
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,280
 That's the reality.

890
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,720
 No one is born right with God.

891
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,720
 And nobody gets right with God by just trying harder.

892
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,240
 Because imperfect people cannot get themselves right

893
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,920
 with a perfect God.

894
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,040
 And the great news is that a perfect God left heaven

895
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,840
 and came to earth in the person of Jesus Christ.

896
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,200
 He lived the perfect life that we couldn't.

897
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,240
 And he died a perfect death.

898
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,840
 And the reason I say it was a perfect death

899
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,560
 is because it was perfectly suitable

900
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,300
 as a replacement for all of the imperfection

901
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,720
 of anyone who had put their trust in Jesus.

902
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,840
 And then he walked out of a tomb,

903
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,960
 conquering our sin and death,

904
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,000
 making a way when there was no way.

905
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,840
 This is the beauty of Christianity.

906
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,320
 This is the beauty of Jesus.

907
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,280
 He's made a way for imperfect people

908
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
 to come into a place like this

909
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,800
 and to stretch out our hands

910
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,280
 and to worship God and to hear from God.

911
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,960
 For God, the God of the universe,

912
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,260
 to delight in us as his children.

913
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,640
 And the beauty of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection

914
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,280
 is even in the moments, even on the Tuesday nights,

915
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,720
 where we just go through the motions mindlessly

916
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,700
 and we're kind of offering the sacrifice of fools.

917
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,000
 You know what the beauty of the cross is?

918
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,240
 Is that every moment is a new moment with Jesus.

919
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,840
 Every moment is a new moment with Jesus.

920
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,880
 God is quick to forgive,

921
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,200
 and he's quick to welcome you

922
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,360
 into deeper intimacy and fellowship with him.

923
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,500
 So, hey, here's the reality.

924
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,960
 If you've been tuned out for the last hour and 20 minutes,

925
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,300
 God still wants to speak to you tonight.

926
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,720
 This is a moment now for you to meet with God.

927
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,640
 Solomon finishes the passage by simply saying this.

928
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,720
 He just ties it up.

929
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,920
 Verse seven, he says,

930
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,960
 "For when dreams increase and words grow many,

931
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,280
 there's vanity, but God is the one you must fear."

932
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,380
 All he's saying is, look,

933
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,440
 when you just go through the motions mindlessly,

934
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,680
 babbling on, just moving your mouth,

935
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,800
 going through the motions,

936
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,620
 you know what that is?

937
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,780
 That's vanity.

938
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,720
 You know what that means?

939
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,460
 It means that is frustratingly empty.

940
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,280
 It's like trying to hug a cloud.

941
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,060
 You're looking for satisfaction.

942
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,480
 You're looking for fulfillment,

943
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,960
 and you're not gonna find it.

944
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,820
 What's the key?

945
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,640
 True worship.

946
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,400
 Fear God.

947
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,800
 It means come into this place.

948
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,680
 Believe God is here, and he wants to meet with you.

949
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,960
 So here's how we're gonna end tonight.

950
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,120
 It's gonna look a lot like last week.

951
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,080
 I'm gonna pray in just a minute,

952
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,200
 and then when I say amen, here's what you need to know.

953
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,400
 You are free to go, but you're also free to stay.

954
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
 Like you're free to go, and if you're ready to go,

955
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,000
 when I say amen, you totally can.

956
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,840
 I would just ask that you leave quietly

957
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,920
 so that anyone who wants to stay in worship

958
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,840
 for a little bit can worship.

959
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,720
 And if you wanna stay, the band's gonna come,

960
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,200
 band's gonna lead us, and you have the freedom

961
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,080
 to raise your hands or to get on your knees,

962
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,240
 to sit in your seat and pray,

963
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,580
 to just do business with the Lord.

964
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,680
 Like if you need a quieter place to worship,

965
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,640
 you can go up those stairs and out those doors

966
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,280
 into the prayer chapel, and you can just sit

967
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,460
 in a quieter place, meet with God.

968
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,600
 If you need to come down front and pray with someone,

969
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,520
 like we'll have people down front.

970
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,540
 If you need to go out to the welcome desk and say,

971
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,340
 "Look, I don't have a Bible."

972
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,480
 Like if God speaks to us through the word, I want that.

973
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,360
 We'd love to give you one for free tonight.

974
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,520
 If you don't have a Bible, let us give you one.

975
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,960
 Maybe tonight you're gonna walk out there

976
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,560
 and you're gonna finally sign up for lunch

977
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,600
 because lunch is an opportunity

978
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,360
 not just to meet people, but it's an extended weekend

979
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,140
 of just meeting with God together.

980
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,480
 Maybe you just need help taking your next step with Jesus.

981
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,400
 Like you need to talk one-on-one with someone

982
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,280
 who can just help you take your next step

983
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,480
 with the church or with the community group.

984
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,520
 You can go out that door and up those stairs

985
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,840
 to the loft, which will be our next steps.

986
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,760
 Like we just wanna help.

987
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,760
 This is a place for us to meet with God.

988
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,080
 And so I'll pray.

989
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,320
 And then the time is yours to worship.

990
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,520
 Lord Jesus,

991
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:56,200
 you're worthy of everything, Lord.

992
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,400
 I thank you that thousands of young adults

993
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 have gone to all the effort they have to get into this room.

994
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,320
 But since they're here, Lord,

995
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,180
 I pray that every one of them would meet with you.

996
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,560
 That God, in your kindness, you'd just speak to their hearts

997
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,840
 that they would sense that you're meeting with them.

998
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,640
 If there's anyone here who doesn't feel worthy of that,

999
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,800
 I pray that they would experience your grace

1000
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,080
 and your forgiveness tonight,

1001
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,080
 that they would know that no one is too far gone

1002
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,820
 and there is no one that can outrun your love

1003
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,600
 for them tonight.

1004
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,320
 So come and have your way in our lives.

1005
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,680
 We love you.

1006
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,160
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1007
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,920
 (wind whooshing)
