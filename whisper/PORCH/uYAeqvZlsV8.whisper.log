[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [Music]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I love it! Let's go!
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   You guys, man, you are funny. Hey, welcome friends!
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Let's all do the wave! Woo! Oh my gosh! So ridiculous!
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Welcome friends in the room, and friends in Fort Worth, and in Houston, El Paso.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   This is my family sitting in the front rows.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And Tulsa, College up in the loft, all the different people that are joining us right now from wherever you are.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Hey, anyone a big fan of pineapples?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Yeah, wow! Man, we gotta get you guys out more, okay?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Here's a little fun fact about pineapples. This probably cost about $2, maybe $3 today.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   But there was a time in the history of the pineapple
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   where a pineapple would have cost you about $8,000.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   This is a terrible pineapple, it's falling apart.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   $8,000.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   With Columbus!
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Oh, I love it! You guys, you got me. I love it, you got me on that one.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Hey, there was a time where Columbus discovered the pineapple in the ancient, in the new world,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and he brought this fruit back, and it was such a luxury item.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   They'd never seen anything like it before, and Christopher Columbus discovered it, they brought it back to England,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and this thing became like only the elite of the elite had access to a pineapple.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It becomes such a status symbol that people wouldn't even eat the pineapple.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I mean, true story, in today's money, it would have been the equivalent of $8,000.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Think about that. What I'm holding right now, if you back up to the 1600s and 1700s,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I mean, this thing would be worth more than my car.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   This thing would be worth, in such a way, you'd be like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe that guy has a pineapple."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Everyone would gather down front, want to take pictures with the pineapple.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   True story. I mean, this is not crazy.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   In fact, there's even a famous picture by King Charles II of England,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   where in the 1670s, he commissioned someone to paint, to do a painting of him receiving a pineapple.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's hard to see, but that's what that guy's been down holding up.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   "Here's a pineapple for you, sir."
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That this was such a status symbol in the ancient world.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   There you go, Billy. Enjoy that. You earned it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That people who couldn't afford a pineapple,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   there was somebody who was out there who was a hustler who was like, "Hey, we're going to work around that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   You may not be able to afford a pineapple, but we will rent you a pineapple
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   that you can take around to parties with you and carry it."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   No one ate them. They were literally just a status symbol.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You walk into the house, you'd be like, "Oh my gosh, there's a pineapple on the wall.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   This is incredible. These guys really have arrived in life. Mama made it. Pineapple."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And it's crazy.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Because today we look at it and we're like, "What?"
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I mean, that's like two to three dollars. No one would keep a pineapple.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   No one thinks it's that big of a deal.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And it just is almost mind-boggling.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Now, what does that have to do with what I'm talking about tonight?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Well, here's what's interesting.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   The pineapple hasn't changed.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Same fruit. Same kind of prickly outside.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Same top on it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   The pineapple pointing hasn't changed.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Our perspective on it has.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Thanks to the invention of kind of modern agriculture and modern industry,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   we've been able to mass produce, you know, not just pineapple, all kinds of foods.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And because of that, the value of this thing that was once seen as such incredibly valuable
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   has plummeted.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   But the pineapple hasn't changed.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Just our perspective on it has.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I think that's such a great parallel and illustration
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   for what we're going to talk about tonight, which is the topic of sex.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That sex was this thing that was to be this exclusive experience
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   between one man and one woman for life.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   This thing that you would enter into with a spouse, with a husband or a wife,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   that you would never have to wonder if they were comparing you to someone else
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   because you were the only someone they'd ever been with.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   This thing that you never had to worry, "Am I going to get an STD with this person?"
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And this thing that was of such incredible value that God created
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and He gave to be experienced exclusively.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Something incredibly valuable that we live in a culture that has so devalued this thing
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and sex hasn't changed, our perspective on it has.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And we're in a series called "Lyrics and Lies,"
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   and tonight we're going to cover a topic that is wrecking havoc on our country,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   on many of us in the room, on all of our lives at some point in some way.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   We've all been impacted by the devaluing of sex
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   that has taken place in culture all around us, and particularly,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   tonight we're going to talk about some of the lies that we've been sold about sex
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   in the songs that we sing, in the songs that we hear,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   in the songs that really shaped us as we grew up.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We're in this series called "Lyrics and Lies Anthem Edition."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   What's "Lyrics and Lies Anthem Edition?"
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's essentially looking back the last 10 to 15 years
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   where we explore some of the songs that shaped so much of our growing up.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Maybe it was your high school, maybe it came out.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   These songs came out when you were in junior high,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   but just kind of anthems that our generation has rallied around, big hits,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   that all of them, we all know the songs.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Some of them, they were our ringtones at some point in time.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They were that song that brings back junior year, "That Someone,"
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and looking at different lies that were contained in some of them.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So tonight, we're going to talk about, really, man, I could pick any song like this,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and it's going to hit something with a sexual lie inside of it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It just seems to be what all of them are about.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But here's one that is probably as famous as any song,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and I may go on record as saying maybe the best beat in the 21st century.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, great beats, man.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   The 2000s took first place for sure in the beats,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   but they introduced something that has been toxic around the topic of sex.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I mean, what I mean by I could, like, literally pick any song.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I mean, think about some of the songs that were famous.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   "Thong Song" by SisqÃ³, "Bootylicious" by Destiny's Child,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   "Shake Your Tailfeather" by Murphy Lee, "My Chick Bad" by Ludacris,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   "Lollipop" by Little Wayne.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   That was a test. That was a test.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And everyone who said "Little Wayne," you are dismissed.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   By Little Wayne, there's so many littles.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Little John, Little Wayne, Little--okay.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   "Hot in Here" by Nelly. Not hot in here, hot in her.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   "Candy Shop," "Disco Inferno," "Blurred Lines," "Get Low,"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I mean, "Milkshake." I mean, something happened.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Like, we went in the '90s from, like,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   âª I want it that way âª
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   to, "To the Window! To the Wall!"
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And I'm going to stop there.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And it's like, dude, wow, that escalated quickly, okay?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I mean, it just quickly--
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   all of a sudden, culture became so sexualized.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I mean, truly, it just exploded wherever the song--
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and it only gets worse.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I mean, we were talking to our team today
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   about some of the songs out today,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and it's like, man, we have become so desensitized
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   as a culture.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I mean, songs that our parents or our grandparents
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   would have heard and been like, "Oh, my gosh,"
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   are just kind of like, man, it's awesome.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It's a great beat.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And it is--it's almost disturbing
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   how desensitized myself included,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   we've all become, some of the message--
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   I mean, it's audio porn,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   especially some of the songs that are coming out today.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   When you look at "Fifi," you look at just any number of the--
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   everything that Nicki Minaj has ever put out.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Or you look at, you know, Post Malone stuff.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I mean, it's--it's sad.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And is it any wonder, at a time in our world--
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   like, we live in such weird times,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   because on the one hand, everything is so sexualized.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Like, everything is--like, I can't even read
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   some of the lyrics.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   It's like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm uncomfortable,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   "and I'm your pastor. I can't read this to you."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And at the same time,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   it's clear that there's such dysfunctional sexual behavior
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   that has plagued and is still plaguing
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   so many of the lives in our country.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We live at a time where--between, you know,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Lil' Jon or Lil' Wayne putting out "Get Low,"
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   and then you have Harvey Weinstein
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and everything going on with the Me Too movement.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   We live at a time where rape levels today,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   according to Megan Meeker, in her book
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   "Strong Fathers and Strong Daughters,"
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   said that 12%, 11.9% of females
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   will experience forced intercourse in their lives.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   We live at a time where STDs among the millennial generation
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   are spiking back up.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   There's been a tremendous decline,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and for the first time, really, in the past couple decades,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   they're back on the rise.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   We're divorced in marriages
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   that have been just eroded or destroyed
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   because of sexual unfaithfulness of a partner.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   We're abortion.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   A million children will be aborted in 2018
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   because of sex outside of the context of marriage
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   in an unwanted pregnancy.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   That's 3,000 children a day in our country,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   just our country,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   in a time where sex outside of marriage
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   is so responsible for not just abortion,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   but also for single-parent homes.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   For the very first time, a majority, 54%,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   of children will be raised in a single-parent household,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   54%, where sex has clearly had
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   all kinds of catastrophic impact on our lives.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   We sing it, and we celebrate it,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and these musicians promote it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Inside of the music are such deep,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   destructive, and toxic lies.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   We're gonna talk about a couple of them tonight.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Specifically, what's interesting and challenging
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   about this subject is I think there's really,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   there's a lot of lies contained in some of these songs,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but there's a message consistently projected to the men
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and consistently projected to the women,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and they're slightly different.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's important to distinguish them
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   because I think they impact each of us in different ways
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   among the lines of men and women.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So I'm gonna talk first about the lies
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   that are being told to men,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   and then I wanna look at some of the lies
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   that are being told to women,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   and then I wanna look at some of the remedies
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   from God's Word that we're told
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   in response to these lies that we can live by.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So the first one, let's talk about the lies
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   that are coming to men,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   and that's as clearly or as simply as I can put it
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   that women are sex objects.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I mean, this is every song,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   whether it's "Shake Your Tail Feather" in the club,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Akon, smack that,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   is that women are here for sex.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You should sleep with them.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You should have sex with whoever, whenever,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   as often as you can, however.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   That women are there, and essentially,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   the benefit that women are there to provide for men,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   you should see them as sex objects.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I mean, look at Ludacris in Usher's famous
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   or well-known song, "Yeah."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I'm just gonna read some of his lyrics,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and when you stop and read 'em, you're like,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   oh, wow, man, I can't believe you said that.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So here, I'll read 'em and kind of unpack.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   My outfit's so ridiculous,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   in this club looking so conspicuous.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   He's proud of his outfit.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And, "Row, these women all on the prowl.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "If you hold your head steady, I'm gonna milk the cow."
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I'm not even gonna go into that,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   because that's a sexual innuendo
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I'm uncomfortable even reading.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   "Forget about the game, I'm gonna spit the truth.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   "I won't stop until I get 'em in their birthday suits."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And I don't think he means suits with balloons on the outside.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I think he means naked.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   "So give me the rhythm, and it'll be off with their clothes.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   "Then bend over to the front and touch your toes.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   "I left the jag and I took the rolls.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   "If they ain't cutting it, then I put 'em on foot patrol."
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Basically, hey, I'm not gonna stop
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   until they get their clothes off,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and if they won't comply, they can walk
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   and not have a ride in the car.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   "So give me the rhythm, and it'll be off.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   "How you like me now when my pinkies valued over 300,000?"
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   He's got a big ring.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   "And let's drink, either one to please.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   "Ludacris fills cups like double Ds."
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I have no idea other than he's clearly talking about boobs.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   "Me and us once more, we'll leave 'em dead.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   "We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Then you look at songs like "Blurred Lines"
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and T.I. in his part of that song.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   "So I'm watching and waiting for you to salute
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   "the true big pimpin'.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Not many women can refuse this pimpin'.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   "I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   "This is pimpin', so I don't want to be any confusion here.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   "I am here to use you for sex," T.I. says.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   So right there, we read it, or we played it earlier.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   "I like the way you look in them pants, see you fine.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "Your mama a quarter piece, she's far from a dime."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Not sure why he even goes there, but.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "The type of girl that'll get you up and go make you grind.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   "I'm thinking about snatching her up dirty, making her mine.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   "Look at her hips, what, look at her legs, ain't she stacked?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   "I'm sure I wouldn't mind hitting that from the back."
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   There is a clear message in each one of these songs
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   that women are there and they're sex objects
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   to be lusted over or to sleep with if you can.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And it is so toxic.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And I know it seems like these are extreme things,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   but when you think about the ways that men,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   myself included, you are being bombarded every day
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   with this lie that women are sex objects.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And it feels like, oh, that's a little extreme.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Would I really be bombarded?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I mean, just think about the way that sex
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   has been so commercialized in our culture.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   The pornography epidemic, which only feeds into this,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   which is a bigger business industry than ABC, NBC,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and CBS combined, bigger than the NFL,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   bigger than the NBA, one third of internet traffic
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   is pornography, all of it's feeding into this.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   To just even candidly, the hyper-sexualization
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   that you can't escape, men, and neither can I.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I mean, imagine if you lived in a time in a world
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   where the very first time that you ever saw a woman
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   in her underwear or in a bikini was on your wedding night.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You can't live in that world.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Society around us has taken that option.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I can't drive down the highway
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   without seeing a woman in a bikini.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   You can't turn on TV, you can't watch a commercial
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   without seeing cleavage thrust in front of you.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And so I have deep sympathy,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   but I want us to all be on the same page
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and know, men, there is a war,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   and you are under an attack by an enemy
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   who wants to take you out and wants to take that sex drive
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and let it drive your life to pornography,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   to abuse, to introducing sex into a relationship,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   to one-night stands, that there is an enemy
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   that wants to take you out.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And I don't even think we realize how immersed we are
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   in the sexualization that has taken place all around us.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   It is so far from the biblical values
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   that, tragically, that we're to have,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and it's a tragedy that we're so far.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   What do I mean by biblical values?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   That Paul says, "Hey, this is what I want the young men to do.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   "I want younger men to treat older women as mothers,"
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   1 Timothy 5, verse 2,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   "and younger women, or young women, as sisters
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   "with absolute purity."
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And our culture around us, at the same time,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   that chastises men who clearly abuse,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   who clearly follow the lies that the culture is feeding us,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   that's what Harvey Weinstein is doing.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's disgusting, let's be clear.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   But he's logically following what the message,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   that the men inside of this room,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   you're being fed every single day.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I'm gonna talk about what we do in response to that.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But it's clearly what's happening.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Essentially, what we're being told,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   what the music we listen to tells us,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   what so many of the messages that you hear,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   is, hey, women are something you use,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and then you kinda, when you're done with it,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   you trade it in or you get rid of it.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Essentially, like, hey, treat women like a rental car.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   A rental car is something that, hey, you use, you keep it,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   you keep it for a time, but then when you're done with it,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   you kinda get rid of it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   You don't really pour time and energy into it.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Like, no one in the room has ever gone
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and gotten an oil change on their rental car.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Do we agree there?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   No one is like, you know, I was gonna take this back to Hertz,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   but I'm gonna get the car washed,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   really clean this thing up a little.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   No, everyone's like, I don't care,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I lift trash all over it, I get the insurance,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and I drive it any way that I want.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   That is what culture is saying men are to do,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   as it relates to women.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And is there any wonder how messed up
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   our society is around this issue?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And the lie that's being told to women is just as toxic.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   The second idea I wanna talk about tonight
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   is the lie that's being told to women.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   The lie that's being told to women, which is this.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You ladies should use your body to get what you want.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Use your body, whether that's in the way that you dress,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   in the way that you dance, in the way that you look,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   in the way that you, you know, in sex.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Use your body.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Men are being told to use, women are being told,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   hey, use your body to get what you want.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   You read songs, I mean, there's so many different examples,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   but one that we just heard from,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   from Black Eyed Peas, My Humps.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   My love, my love, my love, your lovely lady lumps.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So her curves.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   My hump, my hump, my hump, my humps, they got you.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   She got me spending, oh, spending all my money on me
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and spending time on me.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   She got me spending, oh, spending all your money on me.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Oh, oh, oh my gosh.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   This is bad grammar.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Time on me.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   What you gonna do with all that junk inside of that trunk?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I'm gonna get you drunk, get you drunk,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   get you love drunk off my hump.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Then I'm gonna use it to lure you in.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I'm gonna use it as bait and intoxicate you.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Or Kaleese, milkshake.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   My milkshake, my body and the way that it moves
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   brings all the boys to the yard.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Not sure which yard she's talking about,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   but and they're like, it's better than yours, right?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's better than yours.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I can teach you, but I have to charge.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and they're like, it's better than yours, right?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's better than yours.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I can teach you, but I have to charge.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I know you want it.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   The thing that makes me what guys go crazy for,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   they lose their mind for,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   the way I wind, I think it's time.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The message, essentially to women, is similar.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It's essentially like, hey dude, the guys out there,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   they are like crazy about women and their curves
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   and their bodies and they just can't,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   you should use that to your advantage.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Use it to get the things that you want.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Use it to, whether the things you want are like,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   hey, I just want free drinks tonight.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Whether the things you want are attention from that guy,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   he's kind of cute over there,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'm gonna pose in a certain way.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It may not even be in terms of a relationship.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   It may be like, hey, kind of use it to get out of a ticket
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and I'm flirting, wink, wink, and here we go.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Use it to get a job.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Use it, you should use your body to get what you want.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It may just be you had a hard day
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and you want some attention or affirmation,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   and that's okay.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   And it is a lie.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And it's furthering the divide
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and it's making the problem worse.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And on both sides, it's broken.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   On both sides, it's a lie.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   The reason use your body as bait
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   to get a guy is so dangerous,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   let me try to be clear,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   is it will work.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Like if you use your body as bait to get a guy,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   it's gonna work.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I don't think you're gonna like the guy
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   that you're gonna get.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But if you use your body as bait, it's gonna work.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   There's a guy out there that would love to take that bait.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You know, in fishing, I don't know if we have
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   many fishers in the room, I'm not a huge fisherman,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I have family that loves to fish,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   but one thing I do know, having spent time with fishermen,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   is that the bait that you choose to use
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   will determine the fish that you catch.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Glad everyone came, in case you don't feel like
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   you're getting your money's worth, how about that?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   The bait that you use, in terms of, is it a worm,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   or is it a piece of meat, or hot dog, or whatever it is,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   the bait you use will determine the fish that you catch.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   All the fishermen are like, did he say hot dog right now?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   He has no idea what he's talking about.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But he is accurate in that the bait you use
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   determines the fish that you catch.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The bait that you use will determine the type of guy
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   that you're gonna catch.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And I don't, as your brother in Christ,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   as someone who is deeply concerned
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and cares about you sisters,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I do not think you're going to like the guy that you catch
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   if your body is your bait.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   You're gonna catch a guy who wants you for your body,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   which means he will trade you in
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   for another body as soon as possible.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Let me say it a little bit more clearly.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   If you catch a guy because of your boobs,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   you will lose him because of your boobs to some other girl.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   You are going to attract a type of guy you do not want.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And so if you play the game that,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   hey, I'm gonna dress a certain way,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I'm gonna take pictures in a certain way
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   to show off and accentuate,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   you're gonna get attention for sure.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I just don't think you're gonna get attention
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   from the type of guys that you're gonna want long-term,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   from the type of guys who are following Jesus
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   wholeheartedly.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I think the biggest temptation in the room,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   if I'm sitting there,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   from just my friends, ladies here,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   is that there's something almost vindicating.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   The temptation is like, I'm gonna use my body
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   to almost kind of get back some of the control.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   'Cause I sit here and there's a bunch of guys
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and they don't ask out
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and they just kind of sit on their hands,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   they're all passive, so I'm gonna kind of take action
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and I'm gonna get out there.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Not just that, there's also like,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   man, guys can be total jerks.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   They don't call me back.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   They tell me they're gonna do something and they don't.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And so I can kind of come out here
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   and it feels like empowering to kind of dress a certain way,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   get attention in a certain way.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And it's a response because of being hurt.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   There's a temptation essentially to like,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   man, I'm gonna put myself in the driver's seat
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   in how I dress, how I look, and how I behave.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And tragically, the answer is not to try
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   to put yourself in the driver's seat
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   by the way that you dress or with your sexuality.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   The answer is to change the people
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   that you're driving in the car with.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   There are godly men out there
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   who are not looking for you to dress in a certain way,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   wear a certain level of clothes,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and if those are the guys that you're hanging out with,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   you're hanging out with the wrong guys.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   You may be thinking, uh, duh, that's all guys out there.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   You are hanging out in the wrong spots.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   To be clear, there's a lot of guys inside of this room
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   who are like that.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And they're looking for bait and they wanna zoom in
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and they're running towards just whatever fits the curves
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and the humps that they're looking for.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   That's in this room.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But there's a lot of godly men in this room.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   There's like a lot of godly men out there
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   who are not looking for curves,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   they're looking for a woman who has character.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And if you date someone,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and the reason why they're attracted to you
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   is simply your curves, you are dating someone
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   who is with you because of a depreciating asset.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He's dating you because of something
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   that is not gonna last.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   If you date a guy just because of the way he looks,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   you're dating someone for a depreciating asset,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   something that's not gonna last.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Gravity wins on all of us.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It just does.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Can I get an amen from somebody over 28?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's like, dang, my back is hurting
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and all I did was like dry off out of the shower.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I'm so old.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And at the same time, I am so sorry.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   For the guys who have mistreated the girls in this room.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   They may not have even been here,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   but you didn't deserve that.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And sadly, it's all too common of an experience,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   but at the same time, the answer is not
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to take back control and get in the driver's seat
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   by seeking to use your body to get what you want.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   The answer is surround yourself with people
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   following Jesus and you follow Jesus.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And that problem is likely to fix itself.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Will it be wolves?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Is there someone that could appear on the outside
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   like they're following Jesus?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Yes.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   But you would tremendously increase your chances
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   of dating the wrong guy or the wrong girl
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   if you date outside of God's people
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and you don't date in community
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   with other believers inside of your life
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   speaking into that.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I, candidly, I have a daughter that's 12 weeks old now
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   and my heart breaks for her
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and for so many girls in this room.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   It is disgusting, the sexualization of women.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And my heart, candidly, is fearful over the temptation
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   that she's gonna feel that she needs to behave a certain way,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   have some sort of sexual experience
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   which still, all the temptations that are gonna rush in
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   because all the messages that are being fed to you every day
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   about how you need to look, how sexual you need to be,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   be a virgin but also be a lady in the street
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   and a freak in the bed,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   all the different things that are just so messed up.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   But I want you to know that the answer
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   is not living according to what the world says.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Anytime that we do, we always invite,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   anytime we bring sex outside of what God's word says
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and live and bring it in line with what the world says,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   we always bring scars into our life.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I was reading a book this past week
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and inside of the book it basically was talking about,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   it was drawing a parallel between how sharks,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   when they mate or have sex, this took a left turn,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   they'll bring scars or they have scars
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   that happen on their body.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Basically, the book was saying how you can identify
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   a female, a great white shark or shark in general
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and you can tell if she's of mating age
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   because she'll have scars on the side of her body
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   because the male shark has to hold on somehow
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so he'll bite onto the female shark
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and it leaves scars behind.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Interestingly enough, the female shark's skin
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   is twice as thick as the male shark's because of that.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   So you can see on sharks, you can look it up later
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   or now or not.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   (laughing)
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   That's weird.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   But you can see these scars that basically communicate sex.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Sex brings scars.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And the reason that's so just profound
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   is not just with sharks that sex brings scars,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   it's with all of us.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Not just physically on the outside, usually not,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I mean maybe that's possible,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   but emotionally, spiritually, mentally.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   What do I mean by scars?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I mean think about it.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   When I think about scars, I think about the friend,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   the family friend whose entire family just disintegrated
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   after their dad's sexual sin was exposed.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   That's a scar, sex brought.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I think about the friend who was molested
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   by a family member at a young age, scar.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Some of the deepest wounds inside of this room, I know,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   are from sex and they're scars.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Anytime sex is introduced outside of the context
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   of marriage, scars.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I think about the friend who was raped by a stranger
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   in her own home, scar.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I think about the friend whose wife struggles
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   with sexual intimacy because of the shame of her past
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and the memories it brings up, that's a scar.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Think about the friend who got pregnant
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   after casually hooking up with a guy
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and had an abortion.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And every year on the anniversary of that decision,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   she weeps, thinking about the age
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   the child would have been, scar.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Sex always brings scars outside of marriage.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I think about the pastor who was exposed to pornography
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   in junior high in a hotel with other boys
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   on their way to church camp and battled pornography
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   for nine years in the shame and guilt
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and all the ways it made him not honor women.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   That's my scar, that's one of them.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Anytime we introduce sex outside of the context
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   of marriage, it always brings scars.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And the God who's there, he's not anti-sex.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   He's crazy, he invented sex, that's absurd.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Every time people are like, man, the devil's
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   sexist rock and roll, at least sex is not on his side.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   All of them really would be on God's side.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   But at least for sure that one.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   No one's accusing Steve Jobs of being like,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   you're anti-iPhone, dude, that's what you are.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   That would not make any sense.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   God is, he's the inventor of sex.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   There's commands in the Bible that say,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Proverbs chapter five, it's a command.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Husbands, let the breasts of your wife
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   satisfy you contiguously.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Always be intoxicated in her love.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   That is a command from God.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Think about that.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's not anti-sex, that's absurd.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   He's pro-sex and he's pro-you.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And he knows that sex outside of marriage
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   always brings scars.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Finally, the third idea I just wanna talk about briefly
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and then we'll land the plane,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   is just what's the remedy for these lies?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And the remedy for the lies is always what the remedy,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   anytime there's a lie is, which is the truth.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   The remedy is replacing the lies with the truth.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   What truth am I talking about?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I wanna talk to the girls for just a second.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And guys, you're in the room, so I'm talking to everybody.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Your value has nothing to do with how sexually,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   how sexual you are, your sex appeal,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   the way that you look, your body.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Your value is esteem to give to you
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   because of one reason.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You are made in the image of God.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Let me be clear.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Genesis chapter one, verses 26, 27,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   it says that in the beginning,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   God created the male and female.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   In the image of God, he created them.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   What does that mean?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Maybe you came into the room and you're like,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   man, guys are made in the image of God
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   and females are kinda like, hey, we're here to help.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   That is a lie.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Men and women have been made equally in the image of God.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   In other words, if you got rid of all the women,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   you would lose part of the image of God
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   that's reflected in mankind.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   The value that you have has nothing to do
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   with what a guy says about you,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   with how good you are in bed.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the past that you have.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Your value has been given by God.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   You cannot lose it even if you wanted to.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And this is important because here's what I know.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   If you're in the room, the way that you see yourself,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   the guys in your life are going to adopt
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   and embrace the way that you see yourself.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You think you're damaged goods,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   you think you're not worth anything,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   the men in your life that are gonna surround you
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   are gonna be men who think you're damaged goods,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   not worth anything, and they will take advantage of that.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Your value has nothing to do with your past,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   has nothing to do with your present,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   It has been given by God.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   You couldn't lose it if you wanted to.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   You have been made in the image of God.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   This is why pornography for all of us is so dangerous,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   because it communicates that a woman is just there for sex,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   she's a sex object, two-dimensional idea on a screen.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   The second idea I want to talk about
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   is around the topic of modesty.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Everyone's favorite topic.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I also, 1 Timothy 2, verse nine and 10 says this,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I also want women to dress modestly,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   with decency and propriety, adorning themselves
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   or expensive clothes, but with good deeds
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Paul, what are you saying?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   You can't wear seven jeans or pearls?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   No, he's saying I want you to be considerate
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   of the way that you dress, I want you to dress modestly.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Now, stay with me, 'cause inside of the room,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   a couple responses are going on.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   One is that the vibe can kind of be like,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Christians are always like, hey, modest is hottest.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Not really.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And I want to address that.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   We live in a world where men are being forced
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   these images all the time.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And there is something carnal in every single guy
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   inside of this room, every girl inside of this room,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   but it's being fed, and there's messages that,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   hey, what's really hot is women should look a certain way,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   women should look a certain way.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Is there part of every guy that likes the way
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Beyonce inappropriately dresses at the halftime show?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Yes.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   But it doesn't make it right.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And you can either be a part of perpetuating the problem
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   or helping and providing a solution by dressing modestly
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   for your brothers in the room, and you may be like,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   that's their problem, if they lust over me, you know,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I could be like in an astronaut suit,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and you'd be like, what's up, girl, astronaut?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Yes, that is true.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   But it doesn't mean you have license to dress
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   however that you want.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Is it our problem? Yes, it's our problem.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The Bible commands you are to dress modestly.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Not frumpily, and not in like a, you know, burlap sack.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Be stylish, go all in.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Whatever that means.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   But help your brothers in the room
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   by dressing modestly.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   That means including on your social media,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and this is where I'm just gonna lean in a little bit more here.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   That's what we do. Welcome to the porch.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   That means being cognizant of what you post,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   being aware, mindful of what you post on social media.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It means, candidly,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   you may not want to put the bikini pic
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   as your profile picture.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Awkward.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And that's not because you are, not 'cause you don't,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I'm not trying to stymie, maybe I am trying to stymie,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Paul's trying to stymie, let's blame it on Paul.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   That's what Paul's trying to do here.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Help your brothers and sisters in the room.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You will get attention for the way that you dress.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   It may not be the right type of attention.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And it may not honor God.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Men, I think the lies around women are sex object
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   is something that you are gonna face,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and I face every single day.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And the best action step or truth that you've got to embrace
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   is you've got to pursue healing.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Maybe for the rest of your life.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   You've got to kill pornography.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   You've got to get rid of,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   you've got to be mindful of what you're feeding yourself.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Maybe you're watching Netflix.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   There's so much junk on Netflix
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   that's just as bad as pornography.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Be mindful of the songs or the things that you're listening to.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   The reason pornography, as I said earlier, is so dangerous
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   is it feeds the lie women are objects.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And further, it's every time you watch it,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   you're going to school, and you're getting taught,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   hey, that one woman is not enough,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   and a real woman is not enough.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And you are hurting, if not ruining your marriage,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   long before you even get married.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It will not go away.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   You've got to kill it.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   You've got to live in community and confess
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and live honestly with other guys.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   If you are in the room and you would say, "I struggle.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   "I got an email today, an email yesterday."
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Constantly we get it from guys
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   as it relates to struggling with pornography.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   The same thing happens every time they come down front
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   or they'll talk, they want to meet,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   struggling with pornography,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   want to really experience freedom from it.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Well, tell me what struggling looks like.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Where's your phone?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And they'll pull out their phone, and they have an iPhone,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   iPhone 10, they have an iPhone.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And they are walking around with the thing
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   that gives them access to pornography.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It would be like someone who's an alcoholic
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   walking around with a flask.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   You may have to do what Jesus says in Matthew chapter five,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   go to extreme lengths, where he uses an analogy saying,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   cut off your hand even if you have to,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   where you have to go back to getting a razor phone
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   for a season, and you're like, "I can't get a razor."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   How badly do you want to be healed?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You need to get Covenant Eyes.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   I cannot advertise and commit or talk enough
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   about Covenant Eyes, which is a software
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   that you can put onto your computer
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   that will help monitor the websites that you're going to.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And this is speaking from someone
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   who faces the same temptation every single day.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   That the truth that you've got to embrace
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   is you have got to move towards healing.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And that involves community and living authentically
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   with other guys inside of your life.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   This changed my life.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   My junior year of college, coming honest with other dudes
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   and opening up about pornography,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and getting Covenant Eyes, it changed my life.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Freedom is possible, and you can experience it.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Finally, I want to say,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   finally, to the guys,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and then I have one more thing to everyone.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You've got to reject what the world tells you
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   to look for in a woman.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   That it is not curves that you're looking for,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   some, hey, I'm a butt guy or boob guy.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   You are looking for character.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   I cannot highly communicate and encourage that enough.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I've been on set for almost 10 years.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   I can't tell you the number of stories
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   of people who married, wow, she was a knockout,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and their marriage went to ashes.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   What was like, man, she's incredible, the sex is amazing,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and then they weren't believers,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and maybe they were kind of like marginally,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   they were cultural Christians, essentially,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   sleeping together before they got married.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   They ended up getting married, she was a knockout,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and they were miserable together.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   When I compare that to the men and women
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   who married one another, not because of their bust size,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   but because of their commitment to Jesus,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   it's undeniable the difference.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And it's not even close in terms of those
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   who are happily married.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   You've gotta reject what the world says around us.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Ladies, candidly, you've gotta reject what the world says.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   To the men, you are looking for a godly woman of character.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Of character.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Finally, the last lie that I think you've gotta replace
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   with the truth is that your past does not define you.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Your past does not define you.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Your past does not define you.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   If you trust in Jesus and you walk with him,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   regardless of your sexual sin in your past,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   regardless of the sexual baggage that you may carry,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   regardless of the abuse, that wasn't your fault.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   It wasn't your fault.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Regardless of what you carry around,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   God is not done with you, your past does not define you.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And if you will take those things to Jesus,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   there's no limit to which he can't rewrite
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   the story in your life.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   This is personal to me.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   I have a very close member of my family
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   who says things like, man, a godly guy
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   would never want a girl like me.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   That is a lie.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   A godly guy will see you, if you're in the room,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   I want you to listen.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   If you've ever wondered that, if you've ever thought like,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   man, that works for the preacher boy up there,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and yeah, kind of all these perfect people
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   that have it all together, but that wouldn't work for me,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   a godly guy would never like a girl like me.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   You have bought a lie.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   A godly guy, just like a godly woman,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   will see you like Jesus would see you, and does see you.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Jesus, the perfect one of God, a godly guy,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   will see people like Jesus sees people.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   How did Jesus see sexually broken people,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   which was everyone, how did he see maybe
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   the extreme sexually broken person,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   the person who can't even talk about what they've done?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Well, we're actually told multiple times.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   We're told of an occasion with a woman,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and one story in particular, in John chapter eight.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   And in John chapter eight, this woman
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   who's been caught in adultery, she's caught having sex
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   with a man who's not her husband,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and she's caught having a sexual sin
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   that the law said she deserved to die for.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And she's dragged in front of Jesus, caught red-handed.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Jesus, we caught her.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   The law says we should kill her.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   What do you say?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Jesus bends over, this crowd of men standing around,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and a woman in the middle.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   And we're told he begins writing with his finger in the dirt.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   We don't even know what.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And he looks up and he says,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "Let him without sin cast the first stone."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And the Bible says that one by one,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   from the oldest to the youngest, the men walked away.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And left was just Jesus and the woman.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And Jesus bent back down, wrote again.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And then Jesus looked up, and here's what he said.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   John chapter eight, verse 10, Jesus said,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   "Woman, where are they?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   "Has no one condemned you?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   "No one, sir.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   "Then neither do I condemn you."
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Jesus declared, "Now go and leave your life of sin."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   He says, "I don't condemn you.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   "I don't condone your sin, but I do not condemn you."
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   How would a godly guy or a godly girl
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   see someone who has a sexually broken past
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   if they're a godly person like Jesus?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   They will see them like Jesus sees them.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   As a person that is just like them,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   a candidate for God's grace,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   who God can use, who God can restore,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   who can be a part of experiencing the healing
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   that only Jesus offers and brings.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I'll close here.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I mentioned that idea of just sex brings scars.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And the sexual sin in my life has brought scars.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Jesus can heal and he is healing them.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Sexual sin in your life has brought scars.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   But the scars in your life and in my life
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   are just represented by our sexual sin
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   are not the only scars that were brought about.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   There were other scars that were brought and introduced.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   And unlike the scars in your life that don't communicate
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   how valuable you are, your sexual past,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   when you think back, "Oh man, that hurts,"
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   or, "Man, what was done to you,"
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   it doesn't communicate how valuable you are.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   That's not where your scars communicate.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   These scars do.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   They're the scars brought about by your sexual sin,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   every decision that you made to sleep with that person,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   to give your body away,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   every abortion collectively represented
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   in the room to everyone listening online,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   every decision that was made to look at pornography,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   every decision to make to go to the strip club,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   every decision sexually that was sinful
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   brought about these scars.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And they're the scars that are now currently
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   on the hands and legs of the Savior, Jesus,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   who said, "I will go to such great lengths
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "that I will bring about scars on my own body
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   "that do not communicate regret and baggage and pain.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   "They communicate how valuable you are to God."
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Listen really closely and I'm shutting it down.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   We are landing this plane right here.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   The value of a thing, Economics 101, you remember it?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Anyone take Economics?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Economics 101, the value of a thing is determined
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   by what it will bring.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   The value of something is determined
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   by what someone's willing to pay for it.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   That's what determines its value.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   I could say my car's worth a million dollars.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   I could say, but at the end of the day,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   it's only worth what someone will pay for it.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   What is your value?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   What is the value you have?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Some of you in the room,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   you think you are not worth anything.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Some of you think that you're worth what you did today.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   The value you have, let me tell you very clearly,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   the value of a thing is determined by what it will bring.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   What did your life bring?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   The son of God, who would lay down his life,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   whose scars communicate how valuable you are to God,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   despite your past, despite your present.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   That's how loved that you are.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   You've searched and maybe you've searched
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and looked at all kinds of places to feel wanted.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   That's the number one reason guys look at pornography.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It's the number one reason why girls give themselves away.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And all along, the truth of the matter is,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   you've been wanted all along, so desperately wanted.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   How much more valuable could you be?
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   You couldn't.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   You are more valuable to God than anything else,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   that he would give his own life for you.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Your value is not determined by what you wear,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   the way you look, by what you've done.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   It was determined at a cross named Calvary.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Or on a hill named Calvary.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   And a cross that rested there.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   There's no story in the room that God is done with.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   The years the locusts have eaten,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   he could restore and he will restore.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   If you will return to him, if you will walk with him.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Many of you, you need to hear me loud and clear.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   It wasn't your fault.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And healing is offered.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Perfectly, I don't know.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I know permanently in eternity.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   But it's the best shot we got.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   It's the only shot our world has, candidly.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   A world that's so sexually messed up.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   And we have the solution.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It's not in a hashtag.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It's in Jesus.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And it's offered to you, it's offered to me.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Let me pray.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   (soft music)
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   God, unlike the pineapple,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   which value has gone up and down and changed,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   the value of my friends in the room has not.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   It was determined, it was set, it was paid for, it was done.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Life of even your son.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   God, I pray for anyone in this room
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   who has never trusted in Jesus as the payment for their sin.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   They carry the shame and guilt and regret
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   from decisions they made that may have something to do
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   with sexual sin, may have just all across the board,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   that right now you would speak to them,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   minister to them, press on their heart,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   and that they tonight would receive just forgiveness,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   take a step in the direction of healing.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I pray that you would destroy the shackles
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   of pornography in this room.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   The men would confess and women would confess
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   and we'd begin to experience healing.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   I pray for anyone who's sitting here
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   just believing a lie from the enemy
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   that they're damaged goods.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   That you would break through in a way
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   that my words couldn't, the song we're about to sing couldn't,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   and you would renew their mind around who they are.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Which is who you say that they are.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Yours, forgiven, chosen, pure,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   and there is no story too messed up for you to heal,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   for a plot twist to come in,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   something to take place beyond even anything we could imagine.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And so God, would you unleash that now.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   We confess we are sexually broken
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   and we have walked in sexual sin, Lord.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And we receive your forgiveness by grace,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   by trusting in what Jesus did for us,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   dying in our place and rising from the dead.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   We are who you say we are, God.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
