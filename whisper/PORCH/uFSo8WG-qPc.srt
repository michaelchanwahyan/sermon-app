1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (Music)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 You guys know what Friday is?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Yeah, the Olympics, man.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 It's like one person knows and the whole crowd.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Wow.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 So Friday, just so you guys know, the Olympics, the Winter Olympics starts.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 So a buddy of mine, a close friend of mine,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 was actually in the Torino Games, the Vancouver Games.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 He won a gold, two silver, and two bronze.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And so what you're going to see on Friday, he and I were talking.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 He was in town this weekend, and we actually talked today.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And what you're going to see, and you guys know this,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 but it's like the greatest athletes in the world.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 But no one's just kind of going out there for the first time, right?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 No one's just kind of stepping on the skating rink

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 or going out there on the halfpipe for the first time, just strapped to snow.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Could you imagine if Louis Vitto couldn't go,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and he said, "Hey, JP, would you step in for me this round?"

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Like that would be embarrassing.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Why would that be so bad?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Like why would I be so bad?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Because I can't snowboard, I'll have you know.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 But I can't snowboard like Louis Vitto can snowboard.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Because Louis Vitto, as you just saw, he's been training his whole life for that moment.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 He's been training his whole life for that moment.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Like everything has come to that place, the culmination of that halfpipe.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It started on sidewalks with skateboards, man.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It started when he was five years old, and he got that first snowboard for Christmas.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It started when his driveway froze over, and so he goes out there.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Now, I don't know if he knew when his driveway froze over when he was five,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 and he strapped the snowboard to his feet, and he slid down it.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I don't know if he knew that that would lead to the Olympics.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But that's exactly what it did.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And every single moment of your life is training for some future moment.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Every single moment of your life is training for some future moment.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Like I was talking to my buddy, and my buddy's from Houston, Texas,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 and he was in the Winter Games in speed skating, ice skating.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Like how does a boy from Houston compete in the Olympic Games and win a gold medal for speed skating?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Well, here's how. I'll tell you how.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 His dad owned a skating rink. Not ice, but roller.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And so he grew up roller skating all the time, all the time.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And then when inline skates came out, he bought a pair.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And he started inline skating all the time, and then he started inline racing,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 and that led to ice skating, and that led to the Olympics.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Do you see how these moments in his life had led to this reality, this destiny, if you will?

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Hey, guys, your life is no different.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Like what I see is I spend so much time with hundreds, thousands even, of 20 and 30-somethings.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 We lack this long vision for our lives.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 We focus so much in the moment, and we don't realize that what we are becoming

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 is what we now are practicing, what we are now training for.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And I tell you all the time, like, great husbands and wives don't just happen.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Great dads and moms don't just happen.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Great elders in the church.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It's not like somebody woke up one day, trusted Christ, and was like, "You know, I think I'll be an elder today."

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The Scripture actually warns us against that.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Don't be quick to lay hands on someone.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 What you are practicing for right now, what you are training for, is what you are becoming.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And we're moving through this series called "Resolutions."

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And as I think and reflect on resolutions, what's interesting is no one resolves to ruin their lives.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Like, that would be crazy.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like, no one goes at life and is like, "You know what? I really want to be divorced by the time--

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I resolve to be divorced by the time I'm 33.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I resolve to have a child out of wedlock.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I resolve to get this STD.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I resolve to get laid off next week.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 That would be fun."

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 No one does that.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Like, we all resolve towards these great things, but the reality of it is,

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 the Scriptures tell us that if we do not gain wisdom, that if we do not gain knowledge,

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 we will resolve to ruin.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's the crazy thing.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Ruin just happens.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It actually happens from not doing the other things, not pursuing wisdom.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Ruin happens.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 In fact, I'll read to you from Hosea 4, 6.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 It says, "My people are destroyed by their lack of knowledge."

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It says in the Scriptures.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 "My people are destroyed by their lack of knowledge."

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 See, no one has to resolve to ruin.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Ruin is what happens when you don't seek a greater wisdom to live your life from.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Like, when you just go through life and you just follow your own desires,

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 you just kind of go with your feelings and your emotions,

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and you follow your heart into traps.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Ruin is what happens.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's what ensues.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And so how do we guard our life against it?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Tonight we're going to talk about resolutions that ruin lives and our need for God's wisdom.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Resolutions that ruin lives and our need for God's wisdom.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It is always my preference to take you to a passage of Scripture and exegete that passage

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 or teach line by line through that passage.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 It is always my preference to present to you clearly the gospel of Jesus Christ.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 But that is not what I'm going to do tonight.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Tonight will be like drinking from a fire hose or fire hydrant, if you will.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So how many points do I usually teach with?

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Anybody?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Three points, usually.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Tonight we have ten.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So buckle up, grab a pen and a paper.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 We're going to go fast.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Grab what is relevant to you.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Forget what isn't.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Feel free to daydream.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 No, I'm just saying don't do that.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'll just bring you up here and then we can talk to you about that.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So week one was resolved to be used through surrender.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 That was week one.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And then week two, last week, with the cage up here, with the jail cell,

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 it was resolved to be free from sin through dependence.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And so week three tonight is resolved to seek wisdom over ruining our lives.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 We're going to look specifically at what God's Word said.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 We're going to be in the book of wisdom, the Proverbs.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So you can just write these down.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We're going to look at why a loving God would give us this instruction.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And before you leave here this evening,

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 we're going to talk about the very things that we should resolve to that won't ruin our lives.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Kind of the antithesis of the resolutions towards ruin.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And so we wrapped up last year in Ecclesiastes.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 In fact, we finished the year in Ecclesiastes 12,

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 where Solomon just says, "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth."

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 He did not say, "Remember God in the days of your youth."

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 He did not say, "Remember the Lord Jesus Christ."

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He did not say, "Remember Jehovah in the days of your youth."

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He said very specifically, "Remember that you were created intentionally."

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Like, do you know who best knows how to use an invention?

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Do you know who best knows how to use some creation?

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 The one who created it.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The one who formed it.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The one who purposed it.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 The one who invented it.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 You were invented very specifically by God the Creator.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And He says, "Hey, you remember Me when you are young."

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 "Remember the reality that I made you and that My instruction is better than yours when you're young."

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 When you're young.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Solomon, who wrote Ecclesiastes, is the wisest man ever to live other than Jesus Christ.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He also wrote much of what is known as the Book of Wisdoms, the Proverbs.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They were wrote in majority by King Solomon.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 This is the Book of Wisdom in the Bible.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 A book that is given to us by God, entrusted to us by God.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It has this collection of writings called the Book of Wisdom or the Proverbs.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 This is what we turn to for practical life application.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Most of the Proverbs is just direct application.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Tonight we're going to look at just about a dozen of them.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 What are the resolutions that will ruin your life?

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 What are the resolutions that will ruin your life?

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 You can ruin your life by, number one, believing that ideas do not have consequences.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Number one, believing that ideas do not have consequences.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 This is the Proverbs. It's in chapter 1, verse 29.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It says, "Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord,

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 and the complacency of fools will destroy them.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 That which the complacent fools sow, it will destroy them."

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 These ideas that they have, these actions that they sow through those ideas,

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 they have consequences.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Proverbs 15, verse 18 says it like this,

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 "The simple believe anything, but the prudent give thought to their steps."

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 This is, in the book of Wisdom, the idea of the law of the harvest.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We see this expounded on in Galatians 6,

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 where Paul just writes to the church in Galatia,

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 "You will reap what you sow. You sow an action.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 You're going to reap a re-action,

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and it's going to be more than you sowed, usually later than you sowed it,

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 but it will be exactly what you sowed."

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 This is the law of the harvest that God has wired into creation.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 This is the reality that today affects your tomorrow.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Who you are today, the way that you pursue God today,

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 will define the way that you love God tomorrow.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We all think we're going to wake up one day

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and just have this deep desire and hunger and thirst

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 to open the Bible and just rip through it and memorize it.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 But the reality of it is that will be defined

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 by the way that you pursue God today.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The relationships you have tomorrow

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 will be defined by the way you pursue relationships today.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Yesterday I was asked--I got to speak with a company over lunch,

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 and they just asked me, "What was the biggest lie that you believed in your 20s?"

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And I simply said this, number one today,

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 the lie that ideas do not have consequences.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Today I've been married nearly 10 years.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 This week my wife and I were in a discussion--we have an amazing marriage--

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 but this week we were in a discussion talking about how

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 the things that I did in my 20s had caused problems in our marriage today,

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 10 years later, specifically in my marriage expectations.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 In fact, as I meet with and do lots--Monica and I together--

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 do lots of premarital counseling and marital counseling,

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 I've never met anyone with marriage problems, ever.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 It's all single people problems brought into marriage.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You see, it's all the problems that were created in their 20s and their 30s

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 that they bring into their marriage.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And so every moment of your life is preparing you for another moment,

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 a future moment.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And so what do we do?

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 This year, 2014, this is your year.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I want you to resolve to walk with God.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 This year, you resolve to walk with God

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and stop pursuing that which is going to bring death to your life.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 The number two way to ruin your life in your 20s,

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 if you want to ruin your life in your 20s, is you can live outside your means.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 How do you ruin your life in your 20s?

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 You live outside your means.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Proverbs 22, verse 7 says, "The rich rule over the poor,

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 and the borrower is slave to the lender."

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 See, I meet with people all the time who are still paying for experiences

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 that they had 5 years ago, a decade ago.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 They're paying for buying decisions that they made a long time ago,

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 and they can't take their excess and be generous with it,

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 as the Scriptures call them to,

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 because all of their excess goes to debt service.

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Another thing that happens is, Monica and I do premarital counseling.

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 This happens all the time.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm going to do someone's wedding, or officiate the wedding.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 They come into our living room,

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and usually we get to talk with one or both of them

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 about the debt they are going to bring into the marriage,

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 sometimes six figures of debt.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And there's usually guilt and shame, like, "Hey, this was mine,

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and now it's going to be ours."

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And those are things that they didn't think about.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And I'm not trying to guilt you, or shame you, or make you feel bad for that,

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 but I am trying to tell you that you need a plan.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You need to think through, "Hey, how am I going to live below my means?"

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Here at Watermark, we offer a class called Money Wise.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Strongly, strongly, if you have a lot of student debt,

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 or even consumer debt, I strongly encourage you to attend Money Wise.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And let us help you put together a plan,

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 so that you can vigorously try to pay that down,

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 so that with your excess you can be generous.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 That you can live below your means.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 That's the resolution, right?

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Resolve to live below your means,

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and vigorously pay off debt,

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 so that you might be generous with your excess.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Another way to ruin your life in your 20s,

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 number three, feed an addiction.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Feed an addiction.

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 This is what we talked about yesterday,

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 when the sin was in the cage, and you went in the cage,

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 and then you're trapped in the sin.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 The proverb says it like this, Proverbs 11, verse 6,

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 "The righteousness of the upright delivers them,

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires."

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 They are trapped by the desires that they pursue,

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 and they get stuck in them.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 1 Peter, chapter 2, says it like this,

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 "Dear friends, I urge you, as people who do not belong to this world,

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 to abstain from sinful," and listen to this,

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "desires which wage war against your soul."

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 There is a war going inside of you.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 You have to make war with that which wages war with your soul,

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 these desires that you have.

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Can I just hit you with a simple truth?

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 When you feed something, it grows.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 That's the simple truth.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 When you feed something, it grows.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 When you feed an addiction, the addiction gets bigger.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So when you think, "Hey, one last time,"

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 that thing that you're trying to kill,

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 it actually gets bigger by that one last time.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 That one last time actually makes it more difficult to kill that addiction.

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And so I think so many people in their 20s and 30s think,

262
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 "Well, when I get married, I'll get right,"

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 or "Later in life, I'll stop that."

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I had a friend tell me once,

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 "I'll struggle with masturbation my entire life until I'm married."

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And like some of you, that might just make sense.

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 You might just be freaked out that I said the N-word.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 [laughter]

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But it's funny because I'm like, "Bro, I've got to break some news to you."

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 That which you do when you're single only grows in marriage.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Those problems that you have, those addictions that you have,

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 when you bring someone else into that, those addictions only grow.

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 They only get worse.

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Now's the time to fight those addictions.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Now's the time.

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Now is the time to seek healing.

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So I don't know for you if it's money.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Money can be an addiction, right?

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Maybe it's sex or pornography, as I mentioned,

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 or maybe it's shopping, right?

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 You just kind of cope through shopping.

282
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 These are all things that when you feed them, they get bigger, they grow.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Like none of you, if I said tonight,

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 "Hey, how many of you, when you're 42 years old, do you want to be an alcoholic?"

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Like how many of you just would love to be a raging alcoholic by the time you're 42?

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Like my guess is none of you would be like, "Well, I kind of want to."

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 The reality of it is that some of you will,

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 and I can probably, just through a range of questions, figure out which ones will.

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 It's the ones who are giving to drink in their 20s.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That doesn't go away.

291
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Like you ever wonder, "Man, how did somebody just become an alcoholic?"

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Well, it's because they loved the bar in their 20s.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 They loved to live there.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 That weekend warrior, "Man, I love to get--

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "Man, let's go get smashed, dude.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 "Oh, it's a long day. You ready to go?

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 "Let's go get messed up, man.

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "Man, I just need to forget about this," right?

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Man, those are the folks--you feed that.

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 It grows to an addiction.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 All of a sudden, you don't feel normal unless you have your medicine.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I see it all the time.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It's just logic. Like I'm not hitting you with anything crazy.

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 That's just logic.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 That's how alcoholics happen.

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And I'm not trying to scare you either.

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I'm just hitting you with some very simple, very basic truth.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 This is how this works.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 That is the law of the harvest.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 That what you are doing today is defining who you are tomorrow.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And so we need to resolve to starve our addictions.

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 You want to see something die, you starve it.

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Resolve to starve your addictions.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 This Monday night is regeneration at 630.

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 You're invited, whether you struggle from an addiction to shopping,

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 an addiction to pornography, sex, an addiction to smoking or alcohol,

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 addiction to drugs, whatever it is, addiction to money,

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 you can show up this Monday night.

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 We would love to chat with you at 630 here at Watermark.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Another way to ruin your life in your 20s--this is a huge one--

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 is to run with fools.

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Number four, how do you ruin your life in your 20s?

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 You run with fools. You hang out with idiots.

324
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Proverbs 13, verse 20 says,

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 "Walk with the wise and become wise,

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 for a companion of fools suffers harms."

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 This truth, this reality is really repeated throughout the Scriptures.

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Bad company corrupts good character.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 This is said throughout the Scriptures, this idea.

330
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It goes over and over and over.

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And so here's the reality.

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 You are becoming who you are hanging around with.

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Fact.

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You are becoming who you are hanging around with.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 All of a sudden they're always sarcastic,

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 and then you find yourself always sarcastic.

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 They always use this word, it's a weird word to you at first,

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and then all of a sudden you catch yourself using that word.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 They go to these places, you think that's weird,

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 you hang out with them,

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 all of a sudden you start going out to those places.

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You are becoming who you are hanging out with.

343
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And it is a force stronger than you.

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 You think, "No, I'm going to do ministry to them,

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I won't conform, I'm stronger than that."

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 No, you will conform.

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 You were wired to.

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's the way that we were created.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 We were meant to live in this idea of community,

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 to be a part of a church.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's called Christ's body.

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You were literally designed and developed and invented

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 and created for it,

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 that you would plug into the church

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 so that you would be hands and feet and eyes

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 and serve with the gifts that God has entrusted to you for Him.

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 That you're using to watch Sex and the City

358
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 with a bunch of crazies.

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Come on.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Kelly, I'm not looking at you, I was looking past you.

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Just kidding.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 My friend, Kelly.

363
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And so I know some of you are like, "Wait a minute,

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Jesus hung out with sinners.

365
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Jesus hung out with sinners.

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Let's think about that for a second, right?"

367
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Jesus shows up to sinners and He gives them a message.

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And then He takes the ones that believe on that message

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and He begins to pour His life into them.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The other ones, the ones that are stuck,

371
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 He just keeps going.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 He shows up, He preaches the gospel.

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So you're like, "I've got a ministry to Lower Greenville, man.

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You don't understand.

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I've got this ministry to Uptown."

376
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Cool, show up in the bar.

377
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 "Hey guys, let me show you.

378
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Hey, everybody listen.

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Put down the shot of Patron.

380
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Hey, did you know Jesus Christ died for your sins?

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And He raised the..."

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 "Hey, I'm going to go.

383
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 If you want to follow me, you come with me.

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 If not, you stay here, right?"

385
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 This is what Jesus did over and over and over again.

386
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So you want a ministry to Lower Greenville,

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 a ministry to Uptown?

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Try that.

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But the reality of it is more times than not,

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 they're influencing you, not being influenced by you.

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 See, they have a ministry to you too.

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 The enemy has a ministry to you too.

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It's to bring you down, man.

394
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 It is to disable your ministry

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 so that you would lose your voice.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And you better believe you're stepping onto a battleground.

397
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And so you want to ruin your life in your 20s,

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 you run with fools.

399
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And so what do we do?

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 We resolve to change our playmates and our playground.

401
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 We say that all the time here.

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 People are like, "Wait a minute, JP, man.

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Are you telling me that if I want to follow this Jesus,

404
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I need to get all new friends

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 and I need to hang out in other places?"

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 In one word, yes.

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That's what I'm saying.

408
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 That's exactly what I'm saying.

409
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Okay?

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That is...

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 But it's really hard.

412
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Hey, I did it.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Trust me.

414
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I know it's really hard.

415
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And you know who those friends called

416
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 when they went through that first and second divorce?

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 You know who those friends called when troubles hit?

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Who those friends called when they were let off?

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 They remembered their old buddy

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 who left them for Jesus.

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And I said, "Hey, man, come back.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Let's talk, 'cause now I have influence.

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I won't be influenced by you.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I can influence you

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 and show you my God."

426
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Right?

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 That's ministry.

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 That is what's ministry.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And so resolve to change your playmates

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and your playground.

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 This next one's a big one.

432
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We're going to elaborate on this

433
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 over the next several weeks

434
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 through a new series called "Battle of the Sexes."

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But number five, if you want to ruin your life,

436
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 carelessly give your heart away.

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 If you want to ruin your life,

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 be careless with your heart.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Proverbs 4:23 says, "Above all else, guard your heart,

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 for everything you do flows from it."

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 The reality of it is, is what you feed your heart

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 will determine who and how you love.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 What you put into your heart,

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 what you give your heart,

445
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 what you feed your heart

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 will determine who and how you love.

447
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And so feed your heart what is good.

448
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Feed your heart the things of God.

449
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 People seem so confused to me.

450
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 When I sit with them, and they're like,

451
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 "JP, man, I just don't get it.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Oh, I'm just attracted to terrible guys.

453
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Man, I don't get it.

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Like, the Lord just keeps putting me

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 in these awful relationships."

456
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And I'm like, "No, he doesn't.

457
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 You're feeding your heart trash."

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And so, of course, you're going to go after those things.

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 From what you watch on TV,

460
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 what you look at on Pinterest,

461
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 what you look at on the internet,

462
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 or whatever that is for you,

463
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 you're feeding your heart corruption.

464
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Of course, it's going to chase those things.

465
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 You're entertained by the very things Christ died for.

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 That's what brings you entertainment,

467
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 the very evil that Jesus gave his life for.

468
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Of course, you're in dead-end relationship

469
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 after dead-end relationship

470
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 after dead-end relationship.

471
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Try feeding your heart the Scriptures,

472
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 living in the context of community,

473
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 asking others, surrender to the Spirit for wisdom.

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Don't cheapen your heart, which is very valuable,

475
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 given and entrusted to you by God,

476
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 indwelt by Christ.

477
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Don't cheapen your heart by giving it away freely.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I really believe, as I spend more time in the Scriptures,

479
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I really believe that God created you

480
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 to give your heart away once, one time,

481
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 and that that would happen at the altar,

482
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 that that would happen in a covenant before God.

483
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I know that's crazy today,

484
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 but I just want you, if you don't believe me,

485
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 just study the history of dating.

486
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Study when these ideas are popularized.

487
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Study the increase of divorce,

488
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 the highest rate it's ever been.

489
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Just study these things.

490
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I'm just coming at you with logic.

491
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I really believe the Lord God Almighty created you

492
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 to give your heart away one time to one person,

493
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 and that he would already have their hearts,

494
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 he would already have your heart,

495
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 and so when you enter into that covenant with him,

496
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 he meets you there,

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 and there's what the Scripture calls a mingling of souls,

498
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 something that can't be undone,

499
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 something that's permanent,

500
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 and so ladies, don't believe a guy

501
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 if he tells you he loves you,

502
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 but his hand is moving towards anything

503
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 other than a ring box, all right?

504
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And ladies, some of you,

505
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 let me talk to you one more time,

506
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 like some of you are here,

507
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 and you're mourning a relationship

508
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 that never even happened, okay?

509
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Like you've given your heart away,

510
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 little close to home,

511
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 you've given your heart away,

512
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 you've given your heart away to a guy

513
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 that doesn't even really know your name, right?

514
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Via Facebook or Pinterest or something else,

515
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 and it's like you're mourning the breakup

516
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 of a relationship that never existed,

517
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 and I'm challenging you on that.

518
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Would you guard your heart, please?

519
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Would you stop letting your heart

520
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 chase after things that don't belong to you?

521
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And gentlemen, gentlemen,

522
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 would you have more depth and character

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 than to simply chase that which is simply pretty?

524
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Okay?

525
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 What is pretty today won't necessarily

526
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 be pretty tomorrow,

527
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and there are few things in life

528
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 worse than a contentious wife.

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Okay?

530
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'm just telling you,

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 there are a lot of beautiful people

532
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 in miserable marriages.

533
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Miserable, miserable marriages.

534
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And so would you just have some depth

535
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 and character and consider

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 how is this woman going to disciple my children?

537
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Like will she be a great disciple maker in the home?

538
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Would you consider some of these things

539
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 and look past just the charm and the beauty

540
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 which the scripture says is deceitful and fleeting?

541
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And so resolve to be careful with your heart.

542
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Proverbs 11, 22 says, I love this,

543
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "Like a gold ring in a pig's snout

544
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 "is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion."

545
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Yeah, ooh.

546
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Resolve to be careful with your heart.

547
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Resolve to be careful with your heart.

548
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I said too often we're entertained

549
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 by the very evil that Christ died for.

550
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 That's number six.

551
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You want to ruin your life in your 20s,

552
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 tolerate evil.

553
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Tolerate evil.

554
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 It's like a frog in water.

555
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Like the temperature just gets hotter

556
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 and hotter and hotter around us.

557
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And before we know it,

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 we're boiling in the very evil climate

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 that we were called to resist,

560
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 but we didn't realize it because we tolerated it.

561
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Let me show you from the scriptures.

562
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Proverbs 8, verse 13 says,

563
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 "To fear the Lord is to hate evil.

564
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "I hate pride and arrogance,

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 "evil behavior and perverse speech."

566
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Proverbs 3, verse 7 says,

567
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 "Do not be wise in your own eyes.

568
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 "Fear the Lord and shun evil."

569
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Let me tell you like this.

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 The only thing necessary for evil to prevail

571
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 is for good people to do nothing.

572
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 The only thing necessary for evil to prevail

573
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 is for good people to do nothing.

574
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I don't know if you've watched the news lately,

575
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 but it's getting crazy out there.

576
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And you were given gifts and talents to do good things.

577
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Like tomorrow night, Luke was telling you,

578
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 like we're gonna talk about pushing back the darkness

579
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 on this idea of pornography, sex trafficking,

580
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 the drug climate in our very own city,

581
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 the prostitution that happens here in Dallas, Texas.

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 What are you gonna do about it?

583
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 What are you gonna do about it?

584
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Right?

585
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 It's getting mad out there.

586
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 The other day I was reading the news.

587
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I couldn't believe what I was reading.

588
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 It was this article about this fifth grade boy

589
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 who went to the women's restroom,

590
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 wanted the freedom to go in the girls' bathroom

591
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 because he felt like it.

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And a girl that stood up to him and said,

593
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 "Hey, I don't wanna go to the bathroom with you,"

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 was accused of hate speech.

595
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I want you to hear,

596
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 and I'm thinking about my own girls, you know?

597
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 I want you to hear me.

598
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I am all about doing everything in love.

599
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Everything in love, consistently in love.

600
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And I know there's this huge message out there for tolerance,

601
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 but you make sure that you don't buy into tolerating evil

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and wicked things, okay?

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Because all of the sudden, you're going to raise your children

604
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 in a world that is consumed with evil.

605
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And God's solution is you.

606
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And God's solution is you.

607
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So resolve to stand against evil around you.

608
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Resolve to stand against evil around you.

609
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Number seven, you want to ruin your lives in your 20s,

610
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 make secondary things ultimate and ultimate things secondary.

611
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Proverbs 30, verse 8 and 9 says this,

612
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 "Keep falsehood and lies far from me."

613
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Now listen closely.

614
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 "Give me neither poverty nor riches,

615
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 "but give me only my daily bread, only what I need right now.

616
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "Otherwise I may have too much and disown you and say,

617
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "'Who is the Lord?'

618
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 "Or I may become poor and still and so dishonor the name of my God."

619
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Let me read it to you again.

620
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Make secondary things ultimate and ultimate things secondary.

621
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 This is a way to ruin your life.

622
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 What the writer of that proverb is saying is,

623
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 "May nothing in this whole entire world,

624
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 "not even my appetite, not even my food intake,

625
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 "not even my wealth or my poverty,

626
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "may nothing distract me from God Almighty."

627
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And so if you want to leave here and you want to pray a prayer over your life,

628
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 pray this one,

629
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 "Lord, remove anything in my life that would distract me from you."

630
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It's a really scary prayer.

631
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 In fact, it causes you to audit those relationships

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 and that job and those things and that status and that stuff.

633
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "Lord, remove anything in my life that would distract me from you."

634
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Anything.

635
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 "Search me, O God, and reveal in me my anxious ways.

636
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 "For you know when I sit and when I stand."

637
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You know everything.

638
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 So let me say this.

639
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I don't know what you're involved in.

640
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Probably lots of good things like working out, getting fit.

641
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That's a great thing. Resolve to be fit. Resolve to work out. It's good.

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Your work.

643
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I hope Christians have a really strong work ethic.

644
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I hope Christians are some of the best employees out there.

645
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So your work, that's a good thing.

646
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Your relationships, your boyfriend/girlfriend, great thing.

647
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I'm glad you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend

648
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 as long as you're honoring God in that relationship.

649
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I hope it leads to marriage. I hope I get to do it.

650
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Celebrate that with you.

651
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Those are all good things.

652
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Your hobbies.

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Your sports.

654
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But here's the problem.

655
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 If you know more about Russell Williams

656
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 than you do about Jeremiah, there's a problem.

657
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Some of you are like, "Who's Jeremiah?"

658
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 He wrote a book. You should read it.

659
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 If you know more about Pinterest

660
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 than you do about Ruth,

661
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 we've got an issue.

662
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Let's be honest. Your priorities are jacked up.

663
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 God's not first. Let's just be honest.

664
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Just say, "Hey God, I love you. I love you like second, third, or fourth."

665
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Just under Pinterest. Just like Pinterest and you, God.

666
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 That's how I love you.

667
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Just be honest about it.

668
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Just shoot God straight. He deserves you to shoot Him straight.

669
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 You want to ruin your life.

670
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You prioritize other things above God.

671
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Matthew 6:33 says, "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness

672
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 and all these things will be added to you."

673
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 The first commandment, Jesus says,

674
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.

675
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And the other is like it. Love your neighbor as yourself."

676
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 We prioritize God and the things of God.

677
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Christianity and the Bible is not just a good idea.

678
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You were raised in Dallas, the Bible Belt,

679
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 so the culture says, "Be a cultural Christian."

680
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 It's just a good idea. Do what you want and go to the porch.

681
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Live how you want and show up at church every now and then.

682
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 That was never the intention. This was your life.

683
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 The gospel was the road that you traveled on, the car that you traveled in,

684
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 the force that pushed you down that road.

685
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 It was everything in your life.

686
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 It changed you from the inside out.

687
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 The gospel has always meant change.

688
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It has always meant new creation.

689
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 That your sins went on Jesus Christ and He resurrected from the dead.

690
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And because you've trusted in that, you have new life, new desires.

691
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 You want new things.

692
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 You live for something greater than you.

693
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And so God is ultimate.

694
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And so resolve to keep God and the things of God above everything else.

695
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Above all other things.

696
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 2014 is your year.

697
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 This is the time. I don't care if you tell me you've been a Christian your whole life.

698
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You haven't been, first of all.

699
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 It happened at some point. I've read that.

700
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 But I don't care if you've been a Christian for a long time.

701
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 This is your year.

702
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 To put God first and ultimate above all other things.

703
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 You want to ruin your life. This one is a popular one.

704
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Believe that this life is all about you.

705
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 You want to ruin your life, number eight.

706
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Believe that this life is all about you.

707
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Proverbs 16, 18, just as this famous verse that says,

708
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before the fall."

709
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 See what happens when you believe that this life is about you.

710
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 You begin to use people. People become strategies that you can use for your own personal advancement.

711
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Let me tell you something. God was not created for you.

712
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You were created for God.

713
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And you will not experience life to the fullest until you live your life fully for Him.

714
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 I get to see it all the time. I get to see that incredible.

715
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I have a front row seat for this life change of these young adults that come in and they're just lost in uptown.

716
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And they're living for the world. And they're living for Dallas and stuff and status.

717
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And they come in and the Holy Spirit just grabs their heart.

718
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And then all of a sudden they start to live for God.

719
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And they start to use all of their gifts and their talents.

720
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 There's just this makeover that happens in their life.

721
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And their friends are like, "What has happened to you?"

722
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 "Man, I'm interested in that thing that changed you."

723
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And this ministry is just born around them. It's incredible to see.

724
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 It is incredible to see.

725
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 This is not a movie all about you.

726
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 This is not a movie and you're the star.

727
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 This is a movie that started at the beginning of the beginning and will end at the end of the end.

728
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And it's all about God. And you have this tiny little cameo.

729
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 And you're forgotten before the screen changes.

730
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 There's been a lot that have gone before you and a lot that have gone after you.

731
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 It's not about you.

732
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 In fact, the only part of your life that matters is what you did with an eternal God.

733
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 That's the truth.

734
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 The other day we went to dinner.

735
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And Finley, my little now five-year-old, we walk into this Mexican restaurant.

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And there's these, oh man, what do you call them, pinatas.

737
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 There's these pinatas all over, like hanging from the ceiling.

738
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And I watched her and she kind of walked in curiously and she kind of looked around.

739
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And she's like, just her eyes get real big.

740
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And I don't know what she's thinking. I never know what she's thinking. She's crazy.

741
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 But her eyes get real big.

742
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And she's like, Daddy.

743
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 And I'm like, what baby girl?

744
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And she goes, Daddy, how did they know my birthday was coming?

745
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 You know?

746
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 She thought that they had decorated for her, you know, for her birthday that was coming in a week.

747
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 She's like, how did they know?

748
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 And it's cute when you're five.

749
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 But like some of us, we move into situations where we're like, oh man.

750
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Everything exists for me.

751
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Everybody is at my disposal.

752
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Everyone exists for my own personal advancement, my own personal pleasure, my own personal satisfaction.

753
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 If I walk into a room, everyone's talking about me.

754
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And when you become ultimate in your life, you become dysfunctional.

755
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 That's the truth.

756
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 You become relationally dysfunctional.

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And so stop and start taking captive those thoughts, those conversations you're having in the car.

758
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 You're replaying the tape and you're wondering what they're thinking about you and why did they say that

759
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 and why did he comment that way on my Facebook and I just keep thinking about it.

760
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And why can't I stop thinking about it?

761
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Just stop.

762
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It's not about you.

763
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 God's doing something bigger than you.

764
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 You're here for just a little while.

765
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And so with your everything, worship him.

766
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 It's really all about him.

767
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And so resolve to give your life away.

768
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 If you want to pray a prayer like John the Baptist where he says, "I pray that I would decrease and that you would increase,"

769
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 resolve to give your life away.

770
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 How do you ruin your life in your 20s?

771
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Number nine, live for immediate gratification.

772
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Live for immediate gratification.

773
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Reject this idea of delayed gratification.

774
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Proverbs 21 verse 20 says this, "The wise store up choice food and olive oil.

775
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 The wise are able to wait, but fools gulp theirs down.

776
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Fools follow their appetite to destruction.

777
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Fools take whatever they want in the moment."

778
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 And so the problem with that is most great things in life are worth waiting for.

779
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Very few great things in life come to us quickly.

780
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 And so you've got to ask yourself, "Do you want an amazing marriage or do you want an amazing night?"

781
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Because if you're constantly chasing amazing nights, amazing marriages probably is not available to you.

782
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 That might not be an option for you.

783
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Why? Because you are becoming what you are training for right now.

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Esau gave up his birthright for a cup of soup because he was hungry.

785
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 He followed his appetite and it cost him.

786
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Would you learn to suppress your appetite for destruction?

787
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Would you learn to stand strong and lean in God and depend on Him and withhold that which you want in a moment for something greater?

788
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Resolve to hold out for God's best.

789
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Resolve to hold out for God's best.

790
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 And number 10, a great way to ruin your life.

791
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 A fantastic way if you want to ruin your life in your 20s or 30s is to avoid accountability.

792
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Avoid accountability.

793
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 I love this Proverbs. It's so straightforward. It says this,

794
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid."

795
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 You've got to love God, right? I'll just break it down for you.

796
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 And so the only reason that we avoid accountability is because we don't want to be corrected.

797
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 We don't want to shine a light on our sins and have someone tell us that we should stop doing that which we want to do,

798
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 that which we feel like doing, that which our appetite has taken us toward.

799
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 We just want to go through life and continue to do.

800
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 And we think that one day we're going to wake up and it's just going to be fixed.

801
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 We think that one day that all of these actions that we have given ourselves to, they won't have consequences, these ideas.

802
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And the reality of it is you can't do any of this.

803
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 This was a big do message. Do this, do this, don't do this, do this, don't do this.

804
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 But do you remember the other two messages? If you don't, please catch up.

805
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 If you don't remember those other two messages, you can't do anything.

806
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 You strenuously contend with the power that Christ so powerfully works out in us.

807
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And so what is the right response? It's dependence.

808
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 But as you depend on God, you need accountability. You need to plug into a church.

809
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 If you are here and you think in 2014 that's going to be the year that I really follow Jesus, but I'm not going to join a church,

810
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 you're joking yourself. You are kidding yourself.

811
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 That is a joke, man. And you think, "Wow, who needs to really be a part of the church?"

812
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 You know, it's me and God. It's a personal thing.

813
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Study church history.

814
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 That was never, ever, ever God the Creator's intentions.

815
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 It was always that you would plug into a body and be a hand or a foot or an eye

816
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 and serve within that body and then be surrounded by other Christ followers.

817
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And you say, "Hey, follow Christ together." And you would confess sin to them in a James 5, 16 kind of way.

818
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And if they would restore you, then they would help you.

819
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Let's just look back over real quick what we just have committed to doing.

820
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 You think that you want to resolve to walk with God this year, to live below your means this year.

821
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 You think that you want to starve addictions this year, to change your playmates and your playground this year,

822
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 to be careful with your heart. This is the year, God. I'm going to stop giving my heart away.

823
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 To stand against the evil around you this year, to prioritize the things of God above all other things

824
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 and to give your life away and to hold out, to wait for God's best.

825
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 But you're going to do it alone? No, you won't do it alone.

826
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 You won't do it alone. You can't do it alone. You will not succeed.

827
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 We went out on the street and just asked a bunch of people their resolutions.

828
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 And two things stood out to me. One, no one resolved to ruin their life.

829
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 No one resolved towards anything that was negative.

830
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Everyone says, "Man, I want great things for me."

831
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 But they all also had the wherewithal to know that they could not do it alone.

832
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Would you just watch this with me right now? Just watch this short video.

833
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Hey, PORCH, it's Annetta. This is week three of resolutions.

834
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 So I thought we should get a little man on the street perspective.

835
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 My New Year's resolution is to get back into running.

836
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 I really don't have one because people don't really go through with it.

837
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 To quit smoking this year.

838
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 I don't actually.

839
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 No, I don't have one.

840
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 To start painting more.

841
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 To read the Bible daily.

842
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 A road trip per month.

843
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 I do not have one.

844
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 It's really original, but probably to work out more.

845
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Get healthy, lose weight, work out a little bit more.

846
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Or did you have one last year?

847
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 My New Year's resolution last year was to learn a new type of dance.

848
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 And I didn't do it.

849
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 For the past three years I haven't had one, so I don't think I need one.

850
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 To go to the gym and it didn't work.

851
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 I don't think so. Just forget to make them.

852
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 No.

853
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 I did, working out, and it didn't last very long.

854
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 It was to eat healthier, and no I did not.

855
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 I did not.

856
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 No, I shy away from New Year's resolutions.

857
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 No, I tend to be more realistic and not set resolutions, so I don't disappoint myself.

858
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Not so much. I didn't keep it.

859
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 What do you think helps people succeed in their resolutions?

860
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Definitely community.

861
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Having accountability.

862
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 People around you that are going to help you stay on track and keep you focused.

863
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Definitely community.

864
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Telling it to somebody else so they can keep you accountable.

865
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Someone to hold you accountable.

866
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 I probably did best when I had others right there next to me.

867
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 So the two things to say, hey, I can't do it alone, right? I need help, right?

868
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 There's one more. There's a bonus in 11.

869
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 If you want to ruin your life in your 20s, believe that this message is for someone else.

870
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Believe that God made a mistake by having you here instead of them here.

871
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 It's not for someone else. It's for you.

872
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 I was talking to my friend a while ago, Chad, gold medalist.

873
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 He was kind of walking me through the journey, and he said everything in his life had prepared him for those moments,

874
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 those platforms, if you will, the walking onto the rink, sitting there as the guy says, "On your mark, get set."

875
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 He had been training his whole life for that moment.

876
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 And in Torino in 2006, he got to come home.

877
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 I mean, he was America's golden child.

878
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 He got the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and all attention was on him.

879
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And so he trained for four more years for Vancouver 2010.

880
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 And he went back to Vancouver 2010.

881
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 All he wanted was another gold.

882
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Like there was all of this talk.

883
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 He was picked the favorite, I believe, for two races.

884
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 He was supposed to come back with two gold medals.

885
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 And he didn't.

886
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 He got one more silver and one more bronze.

887
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 And we were chatting just before I walked down.

888
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 And he said, "Man, but it didn't matter.

889
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Like everybody kept -- every news reporter shoved a microphone in my face and said, 'Are you disappointed?'"

890
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 "Are you disappointed?"

891
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 I'm like, "Disappointed? I mean, yeah, I guess I'm let down.

892
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 But listen, I've got something greater."

893
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 Because two months before Vancouver, my friend Chad had placed his faith in Jesus Christ.

894
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 And he began to live his life for something greater than a gold medal.

895
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 And every moment in his life prior to that has brought him to a place where he was on his knees before an almighty creator God saying,

896
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 "You are God and I am not.

897
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And one day, much sooner than I think I'm going to be with you forever and ever and ever,

898
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 would you please stretch my imagination beyond my own little world so that I can live my life for you."

899
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 So that today, the compilation of all of Chad's moments are training him for one moment where he would meet Jesus Christ face to face.

900
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 He would say, "God, I'm not God, but you are.

901
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 You are God."

902
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 And that's going to happen for each of you.

903
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 For each of you.

904
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 And all these little moments that we get to share together,

905
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 the only thing that really matters in them is what we do with that moment.

906
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 What we do with Jesus.

907
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 What we do with our belief about God.

908
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 The fact that we're here learning from the scriptures right now.

909
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 God, I pray that we would become less.

910
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 That you would become more.

911
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 Father, would you help us to resolve to live our lives fully and radically for you.

912
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 God, would you help us to know you and to make you known.

913
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 Lord, we just sing of your praises.

914
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 We sing of who you are.

915
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Would you stir our souls and remind us.

916
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 Would your spirit work inside of us.

917
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 And for those of my friends that are here that don't know you,

918
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 would your spirit pursue and crack open their hearts and would you introduce yourself to them.

919
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 I sat down and David goes, JP, it's Russell Wilson.

920
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 I said, hey, bro, I know Jeremiah, man.

921
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 What do I need to know about Russell Wilson, you know.

922
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 What do I know about Russell Wilson.

923
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 I know he knows my Jesus.

924
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 I read that.

925
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 I read that.

926
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 Some of you here don't.

927
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 I know you wake me up at night.

928
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 I know God is sovereign.

929
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 I do, but I know that he's no accident that you're here.

930
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 And let's not talk about ruining your life.

931
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 Let's talk about ruining your afterlife.

932
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Your life after life.

933
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 He's provided a way.

934
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 You don't have to do anything.

935
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Nothing.

936
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 But trust in him.

937
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Let his spirit do the rest.

938
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 What do I mean by that?

939
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 I mean you came into this place.

940
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 You've done some terrible things.

941
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 I understand that's the terrible things you've done.

942
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 It's just the fact that you think that you're good enough.

943
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 You're not.

944
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 He sent his son, Jesus Christ.

945
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Truly he walked this earth.

946
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 The most polarizing character in the history of the world.

947
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 His book is bestseller year after year.

948
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 And also in the history of the world.

949
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 He split time in half.

950
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 2014 years ago by showing up on the scene.

951
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 A baby in a manger.

952
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Came to die.

953
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 So that everything that you've done.

954
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Every bad relationship that you've pursued.

955
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Every stupid thing you've said.

956
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 All the idols that you've worshipped.

957
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 He was like I love her too much.

958
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 I love him too much.

959
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Put that on me God.

960
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Father you put those things on me.

961
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 I will die in their place so that they can be with you forever.

962
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 You want to ruin your life after life?

963
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 You reject that.

964
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Reject that.

965
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 Pray that you wouldn't.

966
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 I pray you trust in it.

967
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 That you give your life to it and that you'd live for it.

968
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Amen.

969
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:56,000
