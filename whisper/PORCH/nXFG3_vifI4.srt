1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,760
 - Well, hello porch friends, how we doing?

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,800
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,820
 It is awesome to be here.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
 My name's Todd, I get to hang out here at Watermark

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,460
 and drop in on the porch every now and then.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,620
 It is awesome to be with you and all our friends

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,620
 that are dropping in online and they're hanging out

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,280
 in some other places.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,980
 We are glad you're here.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,760
 I know that we just finished this fantasy series

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,060
 about relationships, right?

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,640
 So what I'm gonna do is tie in a little bit to that series.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,020
 We talked about the fantasy guy, the fantasy girl,

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,400
 the fantasy relationship, all that different stuff.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,020
 I'm gonna talk to you about something that I think

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,960
 will drive you into this weekend,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,160
 which is one of my favorite weekends of the year,

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,680
 just with a real heart of gratitude.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
 I love this weekend because there's just not a lot

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,740
 you have to do, right, to get ready for it

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,200
 other than maybe find some folks to hang out with

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,680
 and find some food to take in.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,200
 There's no shopping, no hustling, no getting around,

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,360
 but there is honestly something about holiday seasons

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,060
 that kind of can make it hard for some of us

27
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,560
 because we're like, man, I just wanna share my life

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,680
 and especially my holidays, this time when family

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,920
 gets together, some of you may not feel like you've got

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,720
 a family that are close and you certainly,

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,480
 you know, in our porch community, at this stage of life,

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
 often don't have somebody that's kind of slid a ring

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,120
 on her finger and said, you, I'm choosing you.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,720
 That fantasy idea, I can remember,

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 it wasn't that long ago for me.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
 I can remember there were only really a couple of times a year

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
 maybe four times a year that were hard for me to be single.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,260
 One of them was spring, right?

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,880
 When the azaleas were blooming and the birds were chirping,

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,560
 the weather was nice, everybody kind of crawls

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
 out of their cave, then hibernating,

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,840
 and you see all the couples at the park

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,640
 having a great time together and riding bikes

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,840
 and exercising together, spring was hard.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,800
 The other time I can remember, summer,

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
 summer was hard, right?

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
 'Cause everybody goes to the lake,

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
 they get to go to the 4th of July party

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
 and lay a blanket out and lay next to somebody

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
 and watch fireworks, this reminds me of my heart

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
 right there, just explosions in the sky.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
 (congregation laughing)

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,180
 And yeah, I think fall, fall was hard.

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,680
 Fall was tough, you know, sweater weather,

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
 where I was from, it got kind of cool,

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,760
 I was really skinny so I could wear like four layers

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,240
 of clothing and look like a man,

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
 and it was just awesome, you know?

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 And we could go out there together, we could hang out,

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,960
 we could be together and just kind of, you know,

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,440
 snuggle by a little fire, winter, winter was hard.

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,600
 Right, 'cause it's Christmas, right?

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,680
 I mean, all the Hallmark movies were on

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 and you're like, oh, is there ever gonna be,

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
 like I could be in like, you know,

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,960
 and that and not a movie but like me

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,680
 and Christmas gifts and under the tree and mistletoe,

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
 and like, so really, other than those four times a year,

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,440
 it was easy being single for me.

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,160
 But you know, we all have this fantasy

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,960
 because we have this idea, right?

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,680
 We have this idea that if we just got in a relationship,

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,000
 it'd just be awesome and really, honestly,

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,960
 the mindset of what that relationship would be like, right?

75
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,040
 Specifically the pursuit.

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,920
 Isn't that what you really want?

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,800
 I mean, relationships, we all know relationships are hard.

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,480
 But man, you know, when people are pursuing you

79
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,640
 and it's fresh and it's new, you know,

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,880
 and they're just consumed with the thought of being with you,

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,640
 what I wanna talk to you about tonight

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,520
 is the fantasy pursuit.

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,080
 Like, 'cause girls, I mean, I know, you know,

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,880
 just our world sells this dream that,

85
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
 I don't care if a dragon has locked you up

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
 in a castle, Fiona, there's this guy and he's not an ogre.

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
 I mean, he's a stud and he's coming after you

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,440
 and he's gonna rescue you from the dragon

89
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
 and the castle and loneliness

90
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,120
 and he'll go through hell to come to you.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,400
 I mean, that's kind of in kind of every little girl's fantasy.

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,320
 Every guy wants to be pursued in the way that Fiona dreams

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,600
 about this gallant stud that she would respect

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,080
 and long to give herself to and share herself with.

95
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,720
 I mean, the fantasy pursuit, right, it's out there

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,840
 and it's a bit embedded in all of us

97
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,480
 because all of us, let's be honest,

98
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,000
 are just a little insecure, maybe a lot.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,480
 And we're all kind of thinking, man,

100
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,720
 am I really worth love and am I really worth pursuing?

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,520
 (laughing)

102
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,640
 If alarms would go off that I've been lost

103
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,080
 and somebody wants to find me.

104
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,320
 (laughing)

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,760
 Tragically, I mean, you know, listen, honestly,

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
 that means there's an Amber Alert.

107
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,000
 How kind of ironic that that just happened.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,360
 Now, we said, man, when a kid is lost,

109
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,640
 separated from those who want to provide and care for them,

110
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,600
 we let the whole world know and we want to come after you.

111
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,920
 Don't you really have that fantasy?

112
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,280
 I mean, I still do.

113
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
 Look, I've been married for almost 30 years

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,880
 and I want my wife to pursue me,

115
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,280
 not just go, yeah, I'm your wife.

116
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,600
 Of course we sleep together.

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,680
 No, I want my wife to want and long for me.

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,600
 I want it to be, you know, I've always said,

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,840
 and in fact, a guy named Martin Luther

120
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
 who lived a long time ago said this,

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,440
 a man should love his wife in such a way

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
 that she hates to see him leave

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,000
 and a woman should love her husband in such a way

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,480
 that he knows she can't wait till he gets home.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,440
 What he's describing there is that we all,

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,920
 even when we're married, right,

127
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,280
 that we want to be pursued, not just tolerated.

128
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,600
 And there's this idea of just being pursued in general

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
 that is innate to who we are

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
 and all of us are kind of like, I don't know, man.

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
 I don't know if I'll ever, ever find somebody

132
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,480
 who really wants to run after me, who chooses me.

133
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,280
 I started thinking about this, you know,

134
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
 this week a little bit.

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,200
 I think about all the love songs that are out there, right?

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,920
 I mean, you know, in the '80s, Randy Travis,

137
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,600
 "My Love is Deeper than a Holler," man, right?

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,080
 And just all these songs that talk about this love,

139
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,760
 you know, Blake Shelton, "You'll Be My Honey Bee,"

140
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,240
 you know, "I'm This to My That,"

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
 and "We're Gonna Be This to That," right?

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,020
 And I'll just do whatever I've got to get to you.

143
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,640
 I started thinking about great classic movie scenes.

144
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,320
 Y'all fans of "The Last of the Mohicans"?

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,280
 Oh man, come on, right?

146
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,680
 Do you remember this scene right here of Hawkeye and Cora?

147
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,320
 It is when they're hanging out right then,

148
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
 that he's fallen in love with her.

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,980
 She has given his heart to him,

150
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,480
 and they're being chased, right, by the whole British army.

151
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,240
 And they're at this place where they're kind of in a cave

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,640
 behind a waterfall,

153
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,360
 and they're kind of unable to protect themselves anymore.

154
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,020
 And Hawkeye's just sitting there,

155
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,660
 and he's just looking at Cora,

156
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,160
 and he knows he's got to make a decision.

157
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
 He knows if he stays there,

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
 they're gonna kill him in front of her,

159
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,040
 which will break her heart.

160
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
 He can't defend them in any way.

161
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
 And so he just grabs her,

162
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,260
 and he looks at her and he goes, "Stay alive!

163
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,680
 "You hear me?

164
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
 "You serve!

165
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
 "You survive!

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
 "You stay alive!

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,500
 "I will find you!

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,520
 "No matter how long it takes,

169
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,840
 "no matter how far, I will find you!"

170
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,060
 And then he just runs through this wall of water,

171
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,920
 and just dives into the darkness, right?

172
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,580
 He's like, "Man!

173
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,320
 "What a stud!"

174
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
 You know?

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,040
 And if you're Cora, you're like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"

176
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 (congregation laughing)

177
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,520
 And we just, I'm just telling you,

178
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,760
 that's one of those things, it's this fantasy moment.

179
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,560
 I'm like, "I wanna be Hawkeye!

180
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,140
 "I think I could, I'd wanna be Cora

181
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,760
 "if Hawkeye would say that to me.

182
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,280
 "I mean, who doesn't wanna be loved like that?"

183
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,640
 I started to look out there,

184
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,200
 and I came across this story

185
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,900
 just about great love stories, right?

186
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,740
 Here's one, I'm just gonna,

187
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,760
 I'm gonna just, for a little bit more,

188
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,600
 I'm just setting the stage here, okay?

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,000
 And there's this girl, Jessica Sharman is her name.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,700
 Here's a picture of Jessica and her, at the time, fiance,

191
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,760
 when they were in love.

192
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,680
 But Jessica, her whole life, had had epileptic seizures.

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,160
 She really never suffered much from the seizures,

194
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
 other than just the actual seizure itself.

195
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,360
 But one time, they were out on a date,

196
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
 and they were on a train,

197
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,560
 and when they got off the train,

198
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
 her eyes rolled back in her head,

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,280
 and all her limbs went limp,

200
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,920
 and Richard just kinda took her,

201
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,080
 and he immediately dialed her parents' number,

202
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,920
 said, "What do I do, what do I do?"

203
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,560
 And they just go, "Hey, do this, calm down,

204
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,880
 "we'll call 911, and if she doesn't come out of it quickly,"

205
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,960
 and he did, and the parents kinda raced there,

206
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
 wasn't far from their home, and they got there,

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,580
 and Jessica didn't recognize her parents,

208
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,760
 certainly didn't recognize Richard,

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
 Jessica didn't even recognize pictures of herself,

210
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
 and she had what a neurologist said

211
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,820
 was a seizure-induced amnesia, which is very, very rare,

212
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,360
 and so she forgot her whole family,

213
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
 and certainly forgot Richard.

214
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,400
 But Richard pursued her, man, Richard wooed her again,

215
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
 I mean, the parents invited Richard over

216
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,760
 when she started to get well,

217
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,720
 and she said, "I was scared to death,

218
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,760
 "when they left me alone with him."

219
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
 She said, "I, I, I," you know,

220
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
 he starts to take her out to places, and say,

221
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,620
 "Hey, we used to do this together."

222
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,520
 And he just won her heart, she said,

223
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,440
 "I don't remember the first time I fell in love with Richard,

224
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,080
 "but I remember the second time."

225
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,960
 And you're like, dude, that's a movie, that's The Vow,

226
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
 right, that's what you're saying,

227
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
 that's the race of McAdams, right,

228
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,880
 that's Chandler Tatum, right,

229
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,320
 that's who that is, Channing Tatum, right,

230
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,440
 no, actually, that's a different deal.

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
 That was a true story, there's a couple came,

232
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,720
 called Kim and Cricket Carpenter,

233
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,000
 that that was their story, they wrote it into a book,

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
 that they made into a movie,

235
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,960
 but I'm like, either way, right?

236
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,800
 I'm like, I wanna be pursued like that,

237
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
 I want a guy who will fall in love,

238
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,440
 and I'll forget him, and he'll pursue me again.

239
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,780
 (congregation laughing)

240
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,960
 'Cause his vow is that he's gonna love me.

241
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,200
 Here's a really sweet one, true story.

242
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,480
 This is a dad, he ran a fruit stand in Sichuan, China.

243
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,120
 One day, he turned around his fruit stand,

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
 his little daughter was three years old,

245
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,500
 and in the crowd, she was swept up, he panicked.

246
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,000
 He could not find his three-year-old.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
 There's no details, really, whether she was abducted

248
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
 or just what happened, but he just panicked,

249
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
 and in the chaos, in the crowd, it was in that marketplace,

250
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,320
 he lost his three-year-old.

251
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,780
 For 24 years, he looked for her.

252
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
 Never could find her.

253
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,040
 Eventually, he quit his job selling fruit

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,440
 and just drove a taxi, so that everybody

255
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
 who got in his taxi, he could give them a card,

256
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,880
 so this is my daughter, she was three, I lost her.

257
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,320
 I don't know what relationship you have,

258
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,240
 would you just tell somebody,

259
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,120
 if they've ever adopted a daughter or did this,

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
 that they would find her.

261
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,880
 Over 17,000 different contacts were made.

262
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,360
 He drove with signs all around his taxi

263
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
 of his daughter in this.

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,400
 After 24 years, a woman heard this,

265
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
 and she went and she wrote him, said,

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,560
 I think I might be your daughter.

267
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,520
 Got a DNA test, it was his daughter,

268
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,840
 and found her, 24 years.

269
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,840
 Amazing story.

270
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,320
 Before Amber alerts of a loving father

271
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,060
 seeking a daughter, last one, this one's kinda tragic.

272
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,060
 This is a gal, okay, and her name is, I'll look it up,

273
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,320
 it's I, Sam Diego, and that's her cat, Diego.

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
 Look how happy she is.

275
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,520
 But she was fortunate enough to lose her cat.

276
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,080
 (congregation laughing)

277
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,840
 And she looked for her cat for two years,

278
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,720
 and then she found her.

279
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,840
 Look how upset she is when she finds her cat.

280
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,400
 She's bawling, right?

281
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,760
 That's a tragic story, it's a tragic story.

282
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,900
 The girl thought she finally lost her cat,

283
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,680
 and dagnabed cat found its way home.

284
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,020
 (congregation laughing)

285
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,360
 (congregation laughing)

286
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,260
 That one grabs me.

287
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,600
 (congregation laughing)

288
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,340
 Look, all right, we all just had this fantasy pursuit

289
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,120
 that somebody would care for me.

290
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,340
 Well, I'm gonna just tell you a story, I'm not gonna,

291
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,160
 you know, this one, this is one of those messages, guys,

292
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,080
 that I just, I can't pray enough

293
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,580
 that you'll believe it's true.

294
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,360
 Because I don't know if part of your story

295
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,880
 is that there's ever going to be another individual

296
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
 that pursues you, I just don't know, I really don't.

297
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
 But I wanna tell you something,

298
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,080
 I know that if somebody pursues you,

299
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
 and you haven't understood the love

300
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
 I'm about to be talking about,

301
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
 and the radical pursuit that's here,

302
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,240
 it won't matter because you're gonna mess it up.

303
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
 And until you know how radically loved you are,

304
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,100
 and how radically valuable you are,

305
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,520
 all that's gonna happen with people that pursue you

306
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,680
 is in your neediness, and in the imperfection

307
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,640
 of one human to love another human,

308
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,680
 you're gonna mess that relationship up,

309
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,920
 and you're gonna go into an epileptic sin seizure,

310
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,880
 and you're gonna forget how much you were sure

311
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,280
 this person would make you happy.

312
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,380
 Because there is no person that can love you

313
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,080
 the way that you need to be loved,

314
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,260
 except a person that has themselves been forgiven much,

315
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,520
 and so they love much.

316
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
 We talked a lot about this in the series, right,

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,960
 in the different parts of that little fantasy series,

318
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
 and what I just wanna share with you tonight

319
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
 is a true story, and it's a radical story,

320
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,540
 it's almost an offensive story.

321
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,080
 When you understand what God asked a human to do

322
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,320
 in order to illustrate his zealousness,

323
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
 and his love for guys like me,

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
 and gals like you, and guys like you.

325
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,880
 There's a book in your Bible,

326
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,720
 and the book is called Hosea,

327
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,600
 and if you got your Bible,

328
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,560
 turn to the book of Hosea, it'd be awesome.

329
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
 Hosea means literally salvation,

330
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,600
 that's what the name Hosea means.

331
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,800
 It means that there is going to be this overwhelming,

332
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,840
 never-ending, reckless love poured out on you

333
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,840
 that will turn into the one thing that you desperately want

334
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,460
 in your insecurity, and uncertainty,

335
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,800
 informed by your self-knowledge of your imperfection,

336
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,040
 you just wonder, is there anybody who can save me

337
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 from the loneliness of my brokenness?

338
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,080
 And what I wanna tell you, I mean,

339
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,520
 obviously you guys aren't clueless,

340
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,400
 you see where this is going,

341
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,640
 and what I'm just gonna tell you

342
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,720
 is that the radical pursuit that we all really want

343
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,440
 can only really be found in one place.

344
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,960
 Now what God did is he took Hosea, he was a prophet,

345
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,280
 and prophets weren't just people that spoke,

346
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,840
 prophets were sometimes folks that revealed

347
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,360
 an attribute of the characteristic of God

348
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,880
 that people were unfamiliar with or had lost touch with

349
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,400
 so that they could get their arms around it,

350
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,780
 often in a very experiential way.

351
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,320
 God had his prophets do some really crazy stuff.

352
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
 I mean, go read the book of Ezekiel at one point.

353
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,400
 Ezekiel was a prophet that was there to tell the people

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,960
 that God wasn't kidding when he said

355
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,120
 there was gonna be a consequence

356
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,160
 of them kind of putting him off and ignoring him,

357
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,920
 and the way that he established

358
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,680
 that the discipline that they were gonna be under was real

359
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,240
 is he asked Ezekiel basically to go through a melodrama

360
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,080
 which had him cooking his food over dung,

361
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,900
 laying on his side in a public square

362
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,300
 for about a year and a half.

363
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,640
 You're kinda like, what in the world?

364
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,040
 What kind of God would ask a guy to do that

365
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,400
 just to get a message through?

366
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,240
 And that is a God that really is serious

367
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,160
 about the message getting through to people,

368
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,200
 and he was willing to ask guys to do pretty amazing things

369
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,640
 to get that message through.

370
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,680
 Now here's one that is one of the most shocking

371
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,620
 in all the scripture.

372
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,560
 Let me just tell you this.

373
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
 The guy's name, Hosea, means salvation.

374
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,360
 Hosea was a prophet to the nation of Israel,

375
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,520
 and the nation of Israel, I wanna give you a little bit

376
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,840
 of a context of who they were, right?

377
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,160
 There were people that were in bondage,

378
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,400
 there were people that were just like everybody else,

379
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,560
 and God chose to reveal himself uniquely

380
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,800
 through a relationship that he would pursue

381
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,960
 with certain humans that would eventually

382
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,540
 make the rest of the world take notice

383
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,560
 of the unique way that these people were loved.

384
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,400
 Now you need to know this.

385
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
 These people happen to be what we call today

386
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,520
 the Jewish people, and you kinda go,

387
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,240
 why were the Jewish people chosen?

388
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,960
 The answer is just because God chose to use them.

389
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,160
 He didn't love them more than anybody else.

390
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,480
 He just said, I'm gonna especially use you,

391
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,160
 and in my love for you that I pour out on you,

392
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,280
 it's gonna make other people go,

393
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,120
 what is going on with you people?

394
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,480
 And the Jews were to answer, nothing's going on with us.

395
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,620
 We're just like you.

396
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,360
 We're just as rebellious and just as lost

397
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
 and just as desperate and just as insecure,

398
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,240
 but we're not trying to figure out how to work

399
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,500
 toward this God that we don't really know and understand.

400
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,320
 God has revealed himself to us

401
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,040
 and shown us how we can know him,

402
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,100
 even though we ourselves are not worthy of being pursued.

403
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,240
 God has pursued us and rescued us,

404
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,640
 and we're no longer a slave to the best ideas of men.

405
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,780
 We're now set free by the revelation of God,

406
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,300
 and look what he's done for us.

407
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,440
 He's not our God.

408
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,880
 He is the God.

409
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,520
 Come and know him.

410
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,560
 What's really interesting is that you're gonna find out

411
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,820
 that when God rescues people,

412
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,860
 he never does that through performance, through the law.

413
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,020
 The law was given to the Jewish people to show them

414
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,260
 that this God that is pursuing them is a holy God,

415
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,500
 and you're not a very holy people,

416
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,440
 which is why you're constantly in trouble,

417
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,060
 because you've left the God who is kind

418
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,500
 and left the God who is a loving father,

419
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,820
 and so when you leave a loving father,

420
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,420
 you get a hateful one.

421
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,740
 When you leave the God who is life, you're gonna get death,

422
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,300
 and when you leave the God who is light,

423
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,620
 you're gonna get darkness.

424
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
 And so God's just bringing the light and the love back

425
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,680
 to the world by loving Abraham and his descendants.

426
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,600
 Now, what's interesting is Moses gave the law,

427
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,040
 but Moses couldn't lead the people

428
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,380
 into the place of promise.

429
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,600
 It was actually another guy.

430
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,260
 His name was Yeshua, Joshua.

431
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,760
 Joshua's name has the name Hosea in it,

432
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,400
 except the first part of it, Jehovah Yeshua,

433
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,800
 Joshua, the Lord saves.

434
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,920
 You know what's really interesting?

435
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,660
 There's another guy who has the name Yeshua,

436
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,560
 but not in Hebrew.

437
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,000
 In Greek, his name is Jesus.

438
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,060
 That is the Greek Yeshua.

439
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,060
 That's the Greek name for the Lord saves,

440
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,620
 and you're gonna see that ultimately,

441
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,320
 what Joshua was a picture of,

442
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,540
 the one who can deliver you by grace

443
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,400
 into the place of promise is who Jesus was.

444
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,940
 What Hosea is a picture of,

445
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,720
 Jesus is the one who accomplishes it,

446
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
 but what is the story of Hosea?

447
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,220
 Let me remind you, because in it, you're gonna see

448
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,420
 that there's a fantasy pursuit of you and me

449
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,400
 that is almost offensive.

450
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,520
 It's interesting, you know, it won't surprise you

451
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,700
 the way we're gonna close this message

452
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,540
 is by singing a song that right now

453
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,180
 is I think helpful to all of our hearts, right?

454
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,600
 We've been singing a lot, just the reckless love of God.

455
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,700
 As some people go, is that theologically correct

456
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,780
 that you would sing a song?

457
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,420
 God doesn't do anything reckless.

458
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,960
 He's not a God of confusion.

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,660
 Should you sing a song that's like God is reckless?

460
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,540
 Look, here's the deal, here's what you need to know.

461
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,680
 All right?

462
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,980
 I think it's a fair question.

463
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,940
 I mean, it's a good question.

464
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,200
 I'm glad you care about words, whoever you are asking that,

465
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,380
 but we're speaking here anthropomorphically, okay?

466
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,060
 I didn't say that very well, did I?

467
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,780
 (congregation laughing)

468
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,080
 We're speaking here in a way that is understandable to men.

469
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,460
 The love that I'm about to describe to you

470
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,960
 is a love that just seems really unreasonable.

471
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,620
 And to us, it just seems really, really reckless.

472
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,060
 It seems overwhelmingly impossible.

473
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,720
 Man, but if it's true, if it's true,

474
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
 it's true.

475
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,540
 And so, I think it's a good question.

476
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,700
 I think it's a good question.

477
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,820
 I think it's a good question.

478
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,980
 I think it's a good question.

479
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,820
 I think it's a good question.

480
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,660
 I think it's a good question.

481
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,500
 I think it's a good question.

482
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,340
 I think it's a good question.

483
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,160
 I think it's a good question.

484
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,000
 I think it's a good question.

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
 I think it's a good question.

486
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,660
 I think it's a good question.

487
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,500
 I think it's a good question.

488
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,340
 I think it's a good question.

489
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,160
 I think it's a good question.

490
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
 I think it's a good question.

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
 I think it's a good question.

492
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,660
 I think it's a good question.

493
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,500
 I think it's a good question.

494
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,340
 I think it's a good question.

495
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,160
 I think it's a good question.

496
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 I think it's a good question.

497
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,160
 I think it's a good question.

498
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,160
 I think it's a good question.

499
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,160
 I think it's a good question.

500
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,160
 I think it's a good question.

501
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,160
 I think it's a good question.

502
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,160
 I think it's a good question.

503
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,160
 I think it's a good question.

504
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 I think it's a good question.

505
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,160
 I think it's a good question.

506
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,160
 I think it's a good question.

507
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,160
 I think it's a good question.

508
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 I think it's a good question.

509
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 I think it's a good question.

510
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,160
 I think it's a good question.

511
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 I think it's a good question.

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,160
 I think it's a good question.

513
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 I think it's a good question.

514
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,160
 I think it's a good question.

515
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,160
 I think it's a good question.

516
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,160
 I think it's a good question.

517
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,160
 I think it's a good question.

518
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,160
 I think it's a good question.

519
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,160
 I think it's a good question.

520
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,160
 I think it's a good question.

521
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,160
 I think it's a good question.

522
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 I think it's a good question.

523
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,160
 I think it's a good question.

524
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,160
