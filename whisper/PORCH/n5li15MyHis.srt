1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,520
 - Love it, love it.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,360
 Welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,880
 friends in Fort Worth, Houston, Tulsa,

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,480
 everywhere that you are joining us tonight

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,600
 as we wrap up this series, Bad Advice.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
 And we look towards next week,

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,480
 which you already heard about, The Unseen,

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,940
 as we just explore what it looks like as Christians

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,520
 to fight and battle in the spiritual realm

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
 and spiritual warfare.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
 So tonight we'll wrap up the series Bad Advice.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,920
 I'm gonna start with a story

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
 that'll give us some traction for where we're going.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,880
 When I was a senior in college at Texas A&M,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,960
 me and some, (audience cheering)

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,000
 man, it is Aggies here.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
 Did not see that coming.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
 My senior year of spring break,

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,160
 me and three other friends decided,

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,400
 hey, we're gonna go on a road trip.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,840
 It's our last spring break of all time.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,040
 You don't get these in the real world.

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,880
 So we're really excited.

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,580
 We're gonna go take a road trip together.

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,640
 We will decide the destinations of the road trip

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,840
 at some later point.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
 So we had just talked about this idea conceptually.

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
 And then as we got closer and closer to spring break,

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,000
 we're like, we'll figure it out when we get there.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
 None of us were really planners,

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,160
 but the four of us total would go on a road trip.

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,440
 The day before spring break begins, it's Friday,

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,780
 everyone's left town.

35
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,520
 We're sitting in College Station trying to figure out

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,000
 what are we gonna do for spring break?

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,760
 We decide we're either gonna go west

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,920
 or we're gonna go east.

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
 And we'll just throw a number on three,

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,720
 one for west, two for east.

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
 We'll do a collective vote.

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,280
 It's a democracy.

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,220
 And we throw a vote, one, two, three, shoot.

44
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,960
 And east won as a count of three to one.

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,680
 So we get in the car and we just take off going east.

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,160
 We're gonna do a road trip for the next eight days.

47
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
 In the car, the ways that we decide

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,320
 what destinations we're gonna go to

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,440
 would just be whoever was a part out of the four of us

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,880
 that either knew someone in the town that we could go to

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,680
 and go to stay at 'cause we're poor college students

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
 or who had a desire to really see something east of Texas

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
 would be a part.

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,080
 And we just allow that to factor in.

55
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,940
 Collectively, we would decide the destination.

56
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,580
 So we take off, we head up towards Tennessee,

57
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,100
 stop in Memphis, walk in in Memphis, see Graceland,

58
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,220
 which is really not that impressive

59
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,060
 if you haven't been there.

60
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,840
 But we're stopping there in Nashville.

61
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
 Graceland is Elvis's place,

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
 for those of you who don't know what that is.

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
 We stop in Nashville.

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
 We go and see Music City and Knoxville

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
 and go in the Smoky Mountains.

66
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,400
 We head to South Carolina, Charleston,

67
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,840
 because somebody had a connection over there,

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,700
 just like they had a connection of a place to stay

69
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,760
 in Knoxville.

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,800
 And then we continue on.

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,640
 We head towards Savannah, Georgia.

72
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
 We didn't have any connections there,

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,320
 but one of the guys was like,

74
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360
 "I did a project in fourth grade on Savannah.

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
 "How about we go there?"

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,880
 I'm like, "I guess that'll work."

77
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,400
 And we're out here in the middle of nowhere anyways.

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,640
 And so we go to Savannah, we stay there.

79
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,200
 And then another guy was dating a girl at the time

80
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
 in Florida and somehow convinced us

81
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,360
 to drive hundreds of miles out of the way

82
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,800
 to go see her and her friends on vacation

83
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,320
 and hang out with his girlfriend and their girls.

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,500
 And that relationship didn't even last, so how about that?

85
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,340
 And so we drive down there, we stay with them,

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,360
 we hang out there, and then we go to a family member

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,940
 of somebody in the car.

88
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,680
 We stop in Baton Rouge,

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,120
 and then eventually we make it home eight states later

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
 or 10 states later,

91
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
 however many it was, thousands of miles,

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
 these guys staying in either a friend's home

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 or America's Best Value Inn, which is, I'm not sure,

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,560
 it's a tall claim to be America's Best Value,

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,280
 and I'm not sure it lives up to it.

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,620
 It was like the kind of places where you sleep

97
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,920
 in the sleeping bag on top of the sheets and things,

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,040
 'cause what happens in America's Best Value

99
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,960
 may not stay in America's Best Value.

100
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,620
 So all that to say, throughout the entire journey,

101
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,080
 it was the collective decisions of the group together

102
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,720
 and the different people involved on the journey,

103
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280
 the different passengers that spoke into

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,240
 and determined the different destinations

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,480
 and the different directions

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,200
 throughout that journey that we would head.

107
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 Now, why would I start there?

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
 Because in the same way, life,

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,160
 it almost goes without saying, is a journey.

110
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,320
 And on this journey that each of us is on,

111
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,720
 it is those passengers or the closest relationship to us,

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,440
 relationships to us, the closest friends to us, if you will,

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,380
 who will determine at every single turn

114
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,500
 the direction and destinations of your life and of my life.

115
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,660
 Like if I was to say, hey,

116
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,120
 who are your five closest friends?

117
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,360
 Because those friends are going to determine

118
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,020
 the destinations of who you marry, when you marry,

119
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,420
 where you work, how your financials go,

120
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,740
 these different things in your life,

121
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,020
 you'd be like, that sounds crazy.

122
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,580
 And the reality is, is we're gonna see tonight,

123
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,020
 it's not far from the truth

124
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,180
 that each of us is on a journey

125
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,060
 and the passengers or the people closest to us in life

126
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,500
 will determine the direction of our life,

127
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,340
 the destinations that we're headed towards.

128
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,880
 The simplest way to say it would be friends determine,

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,780
 each of us friends, the relationship we have with friends

130
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,900
 determine the direction and destination of our lives.

131
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,660
 Now, why or what does that have to do with bad advice?

132
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,180
 Well, that brings us to tonight's topic

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,000
 as we wrap up the series,

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,560
 which is the final piece of bad advice

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
 which relates to friendship.

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,700
 And it's this piece of bad advice,

137
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,900
 that I can't abandon my friends.

138
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,860
 I can't turn my back on my friends.

139
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,300
 You know, they're my people.

140
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,140
 I can't just walk away from them

141
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,100
 just 'cause I'm kinda growing in this whole God thing.

142
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,500
 I'm stepping into deeper levels of my faith.

143
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,420
 I can't though totally walk away and abandon,

144
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
 I can't change my friends ride or die, man.

145
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,340
 I can't go away from these people.

146
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,960
 And the reason that is bad advice

147
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,700
 is because just like in that situation

148
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,140
 where hey, the friends determine the direction

149
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,900
 and destination of your life.

150
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,980
 If your friends are not headed in the right direction

151
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,460
 or they're headed in the wrong direction,

152
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,280
 they are gonna take along with them you

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,460
 is collateral damage.

154
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,940
 That if you and I live by the mindset of man,

155
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,400
 I just, I can't abandon my friends

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,620
 despite the fact that the friends

157
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,180
 that I don't want to separate from

158
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,740
 or put some distance between are gonna pull me down.

159
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,480
 It's gonna cost you.

160
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,260
 And it's gonna cost me.

161
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,740
 Tonight, we're specifically gonna look at

162
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,340
 what the Bible has to say

163
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,100
 as it gives us just a couple principles

164
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,300
 related to the idea of how powerful friendship is,

165
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,820
 how dangerous it is if you and I associate

166
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,320
 or live in close relationship with,

167
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,620
 allow us to be under the influence

168
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,060
 of people who are not headed in the right direction,

169
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,540
 people who are not following Jesus, if you will,

170
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,380
 and seeking to align themselves with other people do.

171
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,140
 Tonight's bad advice or tonight's principles

172
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,520
 from God's word, if you apply them,

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,260
 here's what I know about you and here's what I know about me.

174
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,240
 Almost every other message that we covered here

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,820
 with maybe a couple exceptions,

176
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,740
 if you apply the principles from God's word tonight,

177
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,700
 the rest of your life really is gonna figure itself out.

178
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,400
 And your life is gonna experience

179
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,720
 so much of the way that God intended and designed

180
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,540
 and really the future, the preferred future that you want.

181
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,020
 And if you don't apply and I don't apply

182
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,740
 what Solomon and the Apostle Paul

183
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,980
 are gonna tell us tonight,

184
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,980
 then what's at stake is far more than just friend circles

185
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,940
 but our faith as people wander from the faith

186
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,360
 because of a result of refusing to say,

187
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,180
 I'm gonna cut off these relationships for a season.

188
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,160
 Your future in terms of even your own life,

189
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,700
 Solomon's gonna say.

190
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,800
 And so we're gonna explore two principles,

191
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,460
 two principles as it relates to friendship

192
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,660
 and a person that you and I are to look for

193
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,140
 or to make sure to have in our closest circle of friends.

194
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,120
 We're gonna start in 1 Corinthians 15 and just look up.

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,740
 Normally we teach a passage of scripture.

196
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,380
 We'll pick one passage of scripture,

197
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,700
 pull out three points and go from there.

198
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,260
 Really tonight we're gonna look at these three

199
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,140
 different passages of scripture

200
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,460
 and pull out two principles

201
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,980
 and then the person that all of us are to look for.

202
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,620
 The first one comes 1 Corinthians 15.

203
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,580
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screen.

204
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,940
 And in verse 33 where Paul says this

205
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 as it relates to the topic of friendship.

206
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,340
 Do not be deceived.

207
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,980
 Bad company ruins or you may have corrupts good morals.

208
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,860
 Do not be deceived.

209
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,800
 Why would Paul have to say do not be deceived?

210
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,680
 Bad company corrupts good morals.

211
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,060
 Do not be deceived as in like,

212
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,580
 or your version may say don't mislead.

213
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,820
 As in people are deceived by this idea

214
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,460
 that I can hang out with people

215
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,020
 who have a different standard of morality than I do,

216
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,900
 who have a different convictions around what they believe,

217
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,740
 who have different morals than I do

218
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,220
 and it won't get off on me.

219
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,040
 It won't impact me.

220
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,380
 And Paul would say you are being deceived.

221
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,100
 You cannot spend time with people

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,800
 who have a morality that differs from you

223
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,600
 and not be affected by it.

224
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,480
 The first idea from this text that Paul's gonna say

225
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 is that man, your friends are more powerful

226
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,540
 than your convictions.

227
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,120
 Our friends are more powerful

228
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,280
 and stronger than our convictions.

229
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,880
 Our friends are stronger than our convictions.

230
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
 That if you run with the wrong people,

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,040
 there's not enough sermons in the world to save you

232
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 from being impacted and being led astray, Paul would say.

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
 There's not enough churches in.

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,280
 It's like, in other words,

235
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
 if you come every single Tuesday night

236
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,080
 where you're hanging with the wrong people,

237
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,280
 you are going to be impacted by it

238
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,420
 and you're gonna be pulled in the wrong direction

239
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,260
 of your life,

240
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,160
 that our friends have more power over our convictions.

241
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
 I mean, think about it.

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,820
 We've all like seen this.

243
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,920
 If you look back at any nature

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,360
 and kind of the decisions in your past

245
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,420
 and how they're influenced

246
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,320
 by not conviction level decisions often,

247
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
 but by the company that we keep.

248
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,360
 If you have ever smoked a cigarette before,

249
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,200
 the first cigarette you smoked, here's what I know,

250
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,040
 you were probably with somebody.

251
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
 In other words, you didn't wake up one day,

252
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
 be like, you know what?

253
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,680
 Today's my day, I'm doing it.

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,320
 Let's do this, get a pack.

255
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,840
 Somebody introduced it to you.

256
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,000
 The first alcohol, whatever drink you had,

257
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,020
 the first time you smoked pot, whatever it is,

258
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,120
 you were in the context, in the company of somebody else,

259
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,480
 that it was in the company of people

260
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,680
 that you made that decision.

261
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,080
 Whatever your sexual history is, here's what I know,

262
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,360
 it is connected to the friends that you ran with,

263
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
 either in high school or in college

264
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,360
 or whenever you began stepping into

265
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,600
 whatever that sexual activity looked like.

266
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,420
 All of us have been shaped by the company that we keep.

267
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,720
 It's stronger than the conviction we have.

268
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,980
 Just like not only does it happen not in isolation,

269
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,740
 so many of the decisions and so many addictions even start

270
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,440
 because of the company that we kept.

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
 We were introduced to something through someone's.

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 Pornography, for many of us, like my story,

273
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,760
 was introduced in the context of other people.

274
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,720
 Wouldn't just randomly sought after

275
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,480
 individually in isolation.

276
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,400
 And not only that, you can see that the company

277
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,080
 is stronger than the convictions you hold

278
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,040
 because just like in that situation with the cigarettes,

279
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,760
 it wouldn't just like in isolation that you do it,

280
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
 but it's also not, generally speaking,

281
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,400
 a result of you changing your convictions on something.

282
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,260
 Like the first time you smoked marijuana,

283
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,720
 probably wasn't because you're like,

284
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
 you know what, it's an herb.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
 I think it's from the earth.

286
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,220
 My convictions on this have really shifted.

287
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,640
 Does anyone have marijuana?

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,500
 No, it was when somebody introduced it to you

289
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,800
 and you were like, you know what,

290
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
 you know, it's not that big of a deal.

291
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,600
 It's legal in Colorado, who cares?

292
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,540
 And all of a sudden, you made a decision

293
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,320
 not based on the conviction level changed,

294
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,060
 but influenced and determined by the company that you keep.

295
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,880
 And Paul says if you run with the wrong people,

296
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
 you will run in the wrong direction every single time,

297
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,380
 no matter how good your church attendance is,

298
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,580
 no matter how much Bible you read

299
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,860
 and how good your quiet times are,

300
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,200
 if you surround yourself with the wrong people,

301
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
 you will move your life in the wrong direction.

302
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,040
 And it's going to cost you and it's gonna cost me.

303
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
 We've all seen it.

304
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,640
 It's almost cliche at this point to say

305
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,560
 like none of us, we're just not strong enough

306
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,280
 at a conviction level.

307
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,500
 Like if you're back in church,

308
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,560
 maybe for the first time in a while,

309
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,760
 maybe you have been joining us for a while

310
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
 and you're like, dude, I just love the porch, man,

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
 positive vibes, I feel like God's at work in my life

312
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,640
 and growing and I wanna continue this journey,

313
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,320
 but I'm trying to figure out how to care for my friends

314
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,420
 'cause I want them to experience

315
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,000
 what I'm getting to experience.

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
 And people will come down and they'll just be like,

317
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,160
 so really what I'm doing is using an opportunity

318
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
 to just be like a light in the world.

319
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
 I'm just trying to be a light, we're hanging out.

320
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,920
 And so when we go out, for the next six weeks,

321
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,480
 I'm gonna be the designated driver.

322
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,140
 I'm gonna be designated driver,

323
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,320
 which slowly moves into, you know what,

324
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,400
 it's her birthday, I'm gonna have one birthday shot,

325
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
 we're gonna do an Uber.

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,120
 We're gonna do an Uber, one birthday shot.

327
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,980
 All of a sudden, oh man, well, a couple of drinks,

328
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,260
 it's her birthday, we're gonna go out, it's her birthday.

329
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,120
 And on and on and on from there it goes.

330
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,400
 And there's always something to celebrate.

331
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,880
 It's always like, it's Bob's one year anniversary at work.

332
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,680
 You know, it's Fourth of July, it's St. Patrick's Day,

333
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,600
 it's Earth Day, there's always something.

334
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,460
 And all of a sudden, you've moved in the direction.

335
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,160
 And the company that you keep is stronger

336
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
 than whatever conviction you make,

337
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
 whatever New Year's resolution you make,

338
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,960
 whatever discipline that you try to enforce.

339
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,640
 The company that you and I keep is going to determine

340
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,500
 and is stronger than the convictions

341
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,660
 that you and I will hold.

342
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,000
 It's stronger, think about this, in your faith,

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
 that it has the ability to impact you

344
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,040
 like nothing else in life.

345
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,400
 And Paul says, do not be deceived, don't be a fool.

346
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,920
 Don't deceive yourself, don't be deceived.

347
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,880
 The company you keep is stronger

348
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,380
 than the convictions you hold.

349
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,880
 It's just a principle.

350
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,200
 And a principle is one of those things

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
 that like any time that you violate it,

352
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,840
 or any time that you go against it,

353
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,200
 you don't break the principle, it breaks you.

354
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 Like if you keep company and you run with fools,

355
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
 it's going to hurt you.

356
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,840
 You cannot, the company you keep is stronger

357
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,680
 than the conviction you hold.

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,920
 And Paul says it's just a principle.

359
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,840
 It's not dissimilar to this.

360
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
 I think this is, yeah.

361
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
 So here's what this is.

362
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,520
 What if I was like, nevermind.

363
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
 Okay.

364
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
 Like an animal or something jumps out.

365
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,800
 Okay, so this is what I call a piece of paper.

366
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,360
 We've all seen one of these before.

367
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
 This is, 'cause that's what it is.

368
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,400
 And this is fire.

369
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,440
 You know what happens when you take fire and paper together?

370
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,600
 Man.

371
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,160
 When you put fire and paper together,

372
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,220
 something happens every single time

373
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,660
 based on the principle of what it is.

374
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
 It all of a sudden begins to burn.

375
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,120
 Okay, so there's one.

376
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,480
 So this piece of paper is different.

377
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,600
 This piece of paper is disciplined.

378
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
 It's memorized a lot of Bible verses.

379
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,640
 It comes to the porch every Tuesday night,

380
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,380
 and it is committed to not catching on fire

381
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,240
 despite getting close to the fire.

382
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
 Here's what's gonna happen,

383
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,880
 or we'll just see how well it does.

384
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,160
 (congregation laughing)

385
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,500
 Well, oh well, I guess that didn't work.

386
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,340
 Why?

387
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,780
 Because the principle behind it

388
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,700
 is that any time you take paper,

389
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,520
 thank you, I'll be here all night.

390
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,920
 Any time you take paper and fire

391
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,980
 and you put 'em together, it's gonna burn.

392
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,040
 It's just a principle.

393
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,620
 Paul says it is a principle.

394
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,080
 The company that you keep is going to either corrupt

395
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,380
 or you are going to conform to the morals

396
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,720
 of the company that you keep.

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,840
 It's a principle.

398
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,840
 You cannot keep the wrong company and not get burned.

399
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,360
 And if you and I are not careful

400
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
 to make sure that we surround ourselves,

401
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
 the closest relationships that we have

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,360
 are people who are like-minded, faith-driven,

403
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,160
 focused on that and not pulling us down.

404
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,880
 Paul says the company you keep is stronger

405
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,840
 than the convictions that you're gonna hold.

406
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,800
 So that's our first principle.

407
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,920
 Our second principle comes from Solomon, King Solomon,

408
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,360
 who was the wisest man who ever lived.

409
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,960
 Solomon, who wrote the book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes.

410
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,080
 He was a guy who was king of Israel.

411
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,400
 God basically came to him and said,

412
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,080
 "Hey, I'm gonna allow you to have,

413
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,380
 "you can ask me for whatever you want

414
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,400
 "and I'll give you that thing."

415
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,920
 Solomon said, "Hey, give me wisdom to rule your people."

416
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,840
 God says, "Man, because you did that,

417
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,760
 "I'm gonna give you wisdom

418
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
 "and just tons of favor and blessing."

419
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
 Solomon becomes the wisest man who ever lives.

420
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
 And he, interestingly enough,

421
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,900
 if anyone you would think is so wise

422
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,400
 that they really don't need to write a ton

423
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,460
 about getting wise counsel and other relationships,

424
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
 it would be him.

425
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,600
 Solomon writes more about the importance

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,280
 of having good friends, wise friends,

427
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,120
 and wise counselors than anyone else in the Bible.

428
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,080
 And here's what he says as it relates

429
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,760
 to the companions that you keep

430
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,520
 or the people that influence your life.

431
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,300
 This is Proverbs 13, verse 20.

432
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,240
 So be on the screen in case you wanna flip there

433
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
 or in case you don't flip there.

434
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,060
 "Whoever walks with or lives with

435
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,320
 "or lives under the direction of, influence of,

436
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,020
 "the wise becomes wise."

437
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,840
 In other words, if you live with a wise person,

438
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,520
 a wise person, biblically speaking,

439
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,340
 is someone who knows God and seeks to follow God's way.

440
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,760
 Whoever walks with someone who knows God

441
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
 and seeks to follow God's way,

442
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,120
 it's like that wiseness gets off on 'em.

443
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
 You catch it.

444
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
 If you hang around wise people, you're gonna catch it.

445
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,240
 And then he says this,

446
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 "But the companion of fools will suffer harm."

447
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
 Then in other words, it's not the companion of fools.

448
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
 If you become, hang on with wise, you're gonna become wise.

449
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,720
 You hang on with fools and you get hurt,

450
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,160
 is what Solomon says.

451
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
 You don't just become a fool.

452
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,200
 You end up experiencing pain as a result of it

453
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
 inside of your life and inside of my life

454
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,400
 that Solomon tells us.

455
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
 And a fool, biblically speaking,

456
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,840
 is someone who knows the difference between right and wrong

457
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,500
 and just doesn't care.

458
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,640
 Like, there's someone who you're like,

459
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
 "Dude, you know if you get caught with that,

460
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 "you could go to jail."

461
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,720
 They're not like, "Oh my gosh, are you serious?

462
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,360
 "We gotta get rid of this right now."

463
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,300
 They're like, "Yeah, I don't care.

464
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,140
 "It's not that big of a deal."

465
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,120
 Or, "Man, it's worth it."

466
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,280
 Or, "I don't care."

467
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,760
 A fool is someone who knows the difference

468
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
 and yet doesn't.

469
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,900
 Solomon says, "If you walk with wise, you become wise.

470
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,140
 "If you walk with fools,

471
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,860
 "you are going to become a fool and pay for it.

472
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
 "You're gonna suffer for it."

473
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,380
 He says, what we've said here before,

474
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,620
 if you show me your friends, I'll show you your future.

475
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,900
 Our second idea from the text,

476
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,100
 the second principle that Scripture tells us

477
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
 is our friends determine our future.

478
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,100
 The friends that you have and the friends that I have

479
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,020
 will determine your future.

480
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,140
 Here's what I want you to think about.

481
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,700
 Everyone inside of the room,

482
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,420
 who are your five closest friends?

483
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,800
 Like, begin to think about 'em.

484
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,220
 You can write 'em down.

485
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,660
 You can elbow, hey, me and you, buddy, besties.

486
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,540
 You can do whatever you want,

487
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,700
 but think about who are the five closest friends

488
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,540
 that you have.

489
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,740
 It's been long said, what Solomon is alluding to here,

490
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,860
 that our friends are gonna determine our future.

491
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,260
 Our friends are gonna forecast who we're becoming

492
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,020
 and the life that we're gonna experience.

493
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,140
 And sociologists have said,

494
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,540
 hey, man, your five closest friends,

495
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,860
 you will be the average of your five closest friends.

496
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,980
 You will be impacted by the five closest friends

497
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,820
 that you have.

498
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,460
 The person you are becoming

499
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,380
 is directly connected to your five closest friends.

500
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,160
 You and I are the sum of the someones inside of our life.

501
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,940
 Who are the five closest friends

502
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,500
 and are they the people that are gonna push you?

503
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,200
 Are they the type of person where you're like,

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,500
 man, if I could just continue to move in that direction,

505
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,380
 if my life continues to move in that direction,

506
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,240
 I'm excited about that.

507
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,540
 Are you dating someone right now?

508
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,680
 Man, this is so huge.

509
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,060
 Gosh, if you're boyfriend or girlfriend,

510
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,940
 if you think about their five closest friends

511
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,820
 and you're like, man, his friends are idiots,

512
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,740
 you should have serious pause.

513
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,060
 Even if you're like, yeah, he's such a great guy

514
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,700
 and his friends are so terrible

515
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,780
 that in contrast, he's like amazing.

516
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,660
 Every time I'm around him, you should have serious pause.

517
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,380
 I'm being so serious, please.

518
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,660
 Same thing with her.

519
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,460
 Because she is gonna become and she is becoming

520
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,580
 the average or she's being impacted

521
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,380
 by her five closest friends, just like you

522
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,240
 and just like I am inside of my life.

523
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,980
 But Solomon says your friends are gonna determine

524
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,660
 your future for the better.

525
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,980
 You don't grow your faith in isolation.

526
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,460
 But the Christian faith is lived out

527
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,180
 and flourishes with other people in our life

528
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,300
 that help encourage us, hold us accountable.

529
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,020
 So you're either gonna become wise

530
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,240
 and grow in your faith and grow with others in your life

531
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,020
 as a result of who you run with

532
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,300
 or you're gonna experience it for the worse.

533
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,460
 I mean, I think if you're anything like me,

534
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,080
 the verse, the second half of the verse about,

535
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,400
 man, if you run with fools, you're gonna experience harm.

536
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,200
 You probably have friends, I have friends

537
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,660
 that are not alive today because of that.

538
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,440
 Because they got in a car, they'd been drinking too much,

539
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,600
 they were hanging with fools and they got in an accident.

540
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,840
 There's friends that you may like me have

541
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,600
 that are on probation because they were hanging

542
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,060
 with the wrong people and they suffered for it.

543
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,420
 Friends that have spent time in prison

544
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,760
 because they were with the wrong people

545
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,040
 and they paid for it.

546
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,440
 And Solomon says, man, you cannot run with fools

547
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,660
 and not get burned, you will pay for it.

548
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,380
 Surround yourself with wise people,

549
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
 people who are seeking to know God.

550
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,060
 It's gonna harm you if you hang with fools,

551
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,200
 it'll harm your dating life, your spiritual life,

552
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,640
 and every arena of your life you're going

553
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,140
 to experience pain or damage from it.

554
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,940
 Am I telling you that if you look around,

555
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,420
 you're like, man, these people are really

556
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,140
 not the type of people who are gonna encourage

557
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,980
 and push me in our faith.

558
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,720
 Are you saying, David, I need to change my friends?

559
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,560
 Really?

560
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,400
 Yes, I'm saying change your friends.

561
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
 You need to unfriend them.

562
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,920
 They are hurting you and they're going to hurt you.

563
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,000
 Just like if you've ever broken up with someone before

564
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
 and all of a sudden you go home

565
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,080
 and you can't stop stalking them on Facebook.

566
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
 You're just like, oh my gosh, look,

567
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,680
 she's out with someone else.

568
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,600
 And you have to eventually unfriend them on Facebook

569
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,440
 because you're like, this is only hurting me.

570
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,900
 In the same way, Solomon would say

571
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,640
 that there are friends in your life

572
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,380
 that you have to unfriend, even if it's just for a season,

573
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,740
 not on social media, in life.

574
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,760
 You have to cut off.

575
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,980
 Does that mean that, hey, you have to not make eye contact

576
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,820
 and totally avoid?

577
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,680
 No, it means that, hey, you may have

578
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,740
 to have some conversations.

579
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,300
 I can't hang out with you on Friday nights

580
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,000
 at the bar anymore.

581
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,540
 It's not good for me right now.

582
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,380
 We can go to lunch.

583
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,540
 I love you, I care about you, but during this season,

584
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,020
 man, I just feel like I'm too easily tempted

585
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,340
 because I'm in a place where, man,

586
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,500
 I think that I could probably pull people up,

587
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,880
 but the truth is I'm just gonna get pulled down.

588
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,400
 And Solomon would say, if you run with fools,

589
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,120
 it's gonna cost you every time.

590
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,020
 It's a principle.

591
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,360
 And you don't break principles,

592
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
 they break you and they break me.

593
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,360
 All of us, here's what I know about your story

594
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,860
 and about my story, is like, your story today

595
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,800
 is like mine, it's been impacted and shaped

596
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,040
 by this principle, for better or for worse.

597
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,280
 Like, whatever the story you have inside of your life,

598
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,000
 it has either been one where God has provided

599
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,580
 good friends or friends, and through those friends

600
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,900
 and relationships of people who know Jesus,

601
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,220
 not perfectly, but they just try to walk with him,

602
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,740
 he's protected you from things.

603
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,640
 Or, that wasn't a part of the story that you had,

604
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,460
 and you were surrounded by people

605
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,860
 and you've experienced pain.

606
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,420
 Or you've experienced just making stupid decisions.

607
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,540
 I mean, JP in my story is very, very different,

608
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,080
 and it's because of this one issue.

609
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,500
 JP's story, like, he'll tell a story,

610
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,660
 he's like, dude, sat in a bar, you know,

611
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,220
 smelled like smoke, I was here, here, that was it,

612
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,380
 and just say things, I'm like, man, what?

613
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,840
 And he's like, yeah, you know, bottle service

614
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,680
 and this stripper was over here, I'm like, dude,

615
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,600
 where were your parents?

616
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,440
 That's what I wanna know.

617
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,760
 And, like, drugs or things, I'm like, man,

618
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,920
 the D.A.R.E. program, really, it had an impact on me.

619
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,400
 And, here's the truth, though.

620
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,880
 Is there's no difference between he and I?

621
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
 Around this one issue, like, he was surrounded by fools,

622
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,640
 and the friends that I had, there was nothing good

623
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,480
 and nothing better about, there's nothing,

624
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,060
 anything good that came out of the story

625
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,940
 of just God's protection inside of my life

626
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,100
 was all a result of friends,

627
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,460
 not a result of anything better or worse.

628
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
 And your story, whatever it is,

629
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,560
 has been shaped by this idea of, like,

630
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,960
 God's source of protection and provision

631
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,060
 is through relationships with people who know him.

632
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,220
 And his desire for you in the future,

633
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,540
 as it is already, as you can look back in your past

634
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,140
 and see the power of relationships,

635
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,700
 his desire for you in the future,

636
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,820
 because friends determine your future,

637
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,780
 is that you would have friends who know God,

638
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,200
 who walk with him, and who wanna help you

639
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,480
 and encourage you to walk with him.

640
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,380
 The husband or wife you will be someday

641
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,760
 is being right now shaped by your five closest friends.

642
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,920
 Are they the right friends?

643
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,620
 Are they the friends that you want to speak into?

644
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,040
 The man, the woman, the mother that you're gonna be someday.

645
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,500
 Your future is being determined by your friends.

646
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,920
 Are you surrounded by the right people,

647
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 just like your past was determined and shaped

648
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,360
 by those closest to you?

649
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,820
 And Solomon would say, walk with wise.

650
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,080
 Walk with wise people.

651
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,100
 And if you don't and you walk with fools,

652
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,660
 you're gonna pay for it.

653
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,140
 Solomon says next, not only how,

654
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,260
 or not just these two different principles

655
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,200
 about how our friends determine our future

656
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
 and how our friends are stronger than our convictions,

657
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,020
 but he really goes into how we are to choose our friends.

658
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,460
 So here's what he says in Proverbs 12, verse 26.

659
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,900
 The righteous, in other words,

660
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,520
 people who want to live the right life,

661
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,040
 people who know God, wanna walk with him,

662
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,820
 and want to live righteously or rightly,

663
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,160
 they choose their friends carefully.

664
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,540
 Look at that.

665
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,720
 People who wanna live the right life or righteous life,

666
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,200
 they choose their friends carefully.

667
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,400
 The word for choose is literally the word spies,

668
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
 as in like they're like sneaking behind the bushes,

669
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,160
 looking at the friend, being like,

670
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,560
 "Ah, I don't know if this guy's in."

671
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,080
 That's the word that Solomon says.

672
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,560
 Hey, when it comes to the closest relationships you have,

673
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,080
 the word for friends is literally

674
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,440
 the word secret inner place.

675
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
 Someone who exchanges with you

676
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,980
 at the most intimate level, he says,

677
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,580
 "You need to choose very carefully

678
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,740
 "who's gonna be inside of your inner circle of friends,

679
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,280
 "inner circle of relationships,

680
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,040
 "but the way of the wicked leads them astray."

681
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,240
 Our third idea from the text

682
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,860
 is choose your friends carefully.

683
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,080
 That friends are not, especially, man,

684
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,400
 as you enter into a young adulthood,

685
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,320
 it's no longer just I met Billy at school by chance.

686
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,940
 The relationships you're gonna have

687
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,280
 are gonna be forged by choice.

688
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,820
 And he says, "Choose the friends

689
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,400
 "that you're gonna have carefully."

690
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,960
 Choose the friends that you're gonna have carefully.

691
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,800
 And so here's where I think we get tripped up,

692
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
 is there's verses like this, and then you go,

693
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,720
 wait a second, but I'm also the light of the world, right?

694
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,640
 And I'm also, you know, Jesus was a friend of sinners,

695
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
 and I'm supposed to go into the world,

696
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,280
 make disciples of all people,

697
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,720
 and so how am I supposed to do that

698
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,480
 with also making sure that I don't hang out

699
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,040
 with people who corrupt my morals or who are fools?

700
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,200
 How do I do that tension and walk along that tension well?

701
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,160
 And the truth is, it is a tension that exists in Scripture.

702
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,740
 But there are seasons inside of your life

703
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,780
 and inside of my life where as you spiritually grow

704
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,420
 and as I spiritually grow,

705
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,260
 we have to cut off the bad companions

706
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,380
 or friends inside of our life

707
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,420
 who are just gonna mess with our morals,

708
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,880
 who are gonna lead us astray from walking in our faith.

709
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,780
 It's like, it's not dissimilar to a tree.

710
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,620
 Like a tree has to have its roots go deeper into the ground

711
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,600
 before its branches can go wide.

712
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,780
 In other words, the deeper the roots go into the ground,

713
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
 the wider the branches can grow.

714
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,580
 In the same way, the Christian life,

715
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,420
 if you're, man, if you're trying to like grow in your faith,

716
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,860
 you have got to go deeper spiritually.

717
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,540
 You gotta let the roots of your faith

718
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,180
 grow deeper into the soil of God's word,

719
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,820
 of God's people, and allow that to be strong

720
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,260
 so that the reach of your branches,

721
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,380
 the reach of your friends and influence

722
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,980
 can be broad and can be wide.

723
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,660
 Tension exists that you and I are to, at times,

724
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,660
 cut off relationships for a season to grow.

725
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,140
 As we say, change your playmates and your playgrounds

726
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,400
 so that your faith could grow stronger.

727
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,900
 In addition to that, you and I are to make sure

728
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,340
 that when it comes to the closest level of our relationship,

729
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,480
 the core people in our life,

730
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,940
 if you're a Christian, it's not an option for you.

731
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,100
 You have to be intentional.

732
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,140
 The core relationships you have must be followers of Jesus

733
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,540
 because you cannot run with fools,

734
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,900
 have your closest friends be fools, and not suffer for it.

735
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,620
 It's like this.

736
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,340
 Here's like a graph that'll show a little bit of it.

737
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,500
 So if inside of these three layers of relationships

738
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
 that we have, there's people that we wanna engage with

739
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,580
 and people we wanna be friends with,

740
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,140
 people that are not necessarily believers

741
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,460
 we can pray with, we can hang out,

742
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,520
 you know, go to take to lunch and support

743
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,080
 and let 'em know that we care about 'em.

744
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,620
 We put those inside of the level of care.

745
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,180
 These are people who are not necessarily believers.

746
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,020
 You work around 'em.

747
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,860
 Maybe they're friends from high school.

748
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,580
 Maybe they're like, hey, she was my best friend

749
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,320
 since fourth grade, but I just became a Christian,

750
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,580
 and I'm trying to figure this out.

751
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,000
 You would put her inside of that care circle.

752
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,760
 Then the circle of influence and circle of core.

753
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,260
 These are both circles that are filled

754
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
 with people who are following Jesus,

755
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
 not saying I'm a Christian, people who are following Christ.

756
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,060
 Circle of influence is closer friends

757
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,740
 or is kind of friends, borderline acquaintances,

758
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,920
 similar worldview.

759
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,580
 We run in the same circle of influence.

760
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,100
 Then there's the core.

761
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,700
 These would be your community group.

762
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,500
 This would be your closest relationships.

763
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,220
 This is not an option for a believer in Jesus.

764
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,260
 This has to be Christ followers,

765
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,780
 that the closest people in your life and in my life,

766
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,180
 the people who are the passengers in the car

767
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,720
 must be Christians.

768
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,460
 Solomon says, "Choose your friends carefully.

769
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,820
 "Don't be a fool, and choose and make sure

770
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,060
 "that those inside of your inner circle,

771
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,040
 "the core, is filled with followers of Christ."

772
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,760
 Here's three qualities that we said to look for,

773
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,520
 three qualities to look for as it relates to friends,

774
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,740
 three qualities that relates to those

775
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,840
 who should be inside of your inner circle and my inner circle.

776
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,120
 First one is that they're following Jesus.

777
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,960
 We already said it.

778
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,140
 They're not a check-the-box Christian.

779
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,560
 The trajectory of their life is following Jesus.

780
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,920
 If you're a guy, other guys.

781
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,640
 If you're a girl, other girls who come alongside of you

782
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,680
 and they are following Jesus.

783
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,040
 The second one is that they are encouraging you

784
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,880
 to follow Jesus.

785
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,920
 They're the type of person who is encouraging you

786
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
 in your faith.

787
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,440
 They're the type of person who, like Jonathan to David,

788
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,980
 and David to Jonathan, says multiple times

789
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,620
 that Jonathan went out and helped King David,

790
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,480
 who's an Old Testament figure, find strength in the Lord.

791
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,500
 That you and I are to have people who encourage

792
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,680
 and help us strengthen our faith.

793
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,940
 People who encourage us on the journey

794
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,180
 and that we can be a source of encouraging,

795
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,800
 hey man, I'm gonna help you follow Jesus.

796
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 I know right now that you want to make irrational decisions

797
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,620
 because of whatever's going on.

798
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,520
 You just broke up.

799
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,460
 I'm gonna be here to support at late

800
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,300
 in the middle of the night.

801
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,740
 I'm here to come alongside of you

802
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,000
 because you're feeling like temptation.

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,100
 You just want to look at pornography.

804
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,160
 I'm gonna come over and not just say I'm praying for you.

805
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,920
 I'm gonna come right now and pray for you.

806
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,840
 People who will encourage you in your faith.

807
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,680
 They're following Jesus.

808
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,920
 People who are committed to encouraging you

809
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,760
 inside of your faith.

810
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,720
 And then thirdly, people who will speak the truth to you.

811
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,400
 People who will speak the truth to you.

812
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,240
 It's so sad.

813
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,480
 Proverbs 27 says that faithful are the wounds of a friend,

814
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,700
 but profuse are the kisses of an enemy.

815
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,320
 That a true friend will love you enough at times

816
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,480
 to tell you the truth and tell me the truth and wound me.

817
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,420
 And here's the thing about wounding,

818
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,060
 no matter who it's coming from, it never feels great.

819
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,120
 But Solomon would say, man, if you have true friends,

820
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,660
 there will be times where they speak the truth to you

821
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,380
 and they're faithful to wound you.

822
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,060
 Do you have friends in your life

823
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,380
 who will love you enough to say, man, I see this in you?

824
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,340
 Has anyone ever brought this up to you?

825
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,540
 I feel like the way you responded then was a little off.

826
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,220
 Has anyone ever told you that before?

827
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,060
 Am I crazy?

828
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,900
 I could be wrong.

829
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,980
 People who love you enough to speak the truth

830
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,340
 and who you love enough to speak the truth,

831
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,220
 that inside of your inner core,

832
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,860
 they gotta be following Jesus.

833
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,980
 They gotta be people who will encourage you

834
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,980
 and help strengthen you in your faith and you in theirs,

835
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,380
 and then people who are willing to speak the truth to you.

836
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,300
 Here's the application for tonight.

837
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,440
 We're about to come close, land.

838
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,740
 Some of you guys, this Sunday,

839
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,100
 you need to come to Watermark at 1115.

840
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,380
 You need to be a part of the community formation groups.

841
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,740
 If you've gone through the membership process,

842
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,700
 this is your Sunday.

843
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,860
 It is your time to step out,

844
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,340
 to change your playmates and your playgrounds.

845
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,520
 If you wanna step away from whatever relationships

846
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,180
 you feel like are pulling you down and you're like,

847
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,140
 yeah, am I just supposed to be lonely all the time?

848
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
 Is that what you want from me?

849
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,420
 No, the Bible doesn't want that for you.

850
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,180
 It wants you to have the best relationships,

851
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,100
 the most healthy relationships you could ever have.

852
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,980
 And the means by which we attempt to create environments

853
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,780
 to do that here at Watermark is called community groups.

854
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,380
 It's the single best thing we do.

855
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,420
 If you have to choose between the porch and community groups,

856
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,660
 go to community, be in a community group every single time.

857
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,420
 Go to community group every single time

858
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,260
 over coming to the porch.

859
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,860
 It is the best thing that we do here.

860
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,940
 This Sunday at 1115, you can go to watermark.org

861
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,780
 and find out more information about getting

862
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,900
 into a community group,

863
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,460
 community formation in stage two C,

864
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,500
 stage two C in the tower, in the tower.

865
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,040
 Second floor of the tower, second floor of the tower.

866
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,100
 In your phone, 1115, second floor of the tower

867
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,660
 across the community formation groups.

868
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,260
 Some of you need to delete phone numbers.

869
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,140
 And you're probably not going to 'cause you're like,

870
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,080
 ah, come on, you know.

871
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,240
 But there's people in your life you just gotta cut off.

872
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,980
 And they keep pulling you down, they keep tempting you.

873
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,380
 You may need to leave here and make a phone call.

874
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,040
 You may need to set up a meeting.

875
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,700
 But Solomon would say, you cannot break a principle.

876
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,920
 If you go against it, it will break you.

877
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,340
 If you run with fools, you're gonna be a fool

878
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,900
 and you're gonna pay for it.

879
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
 And I'm gonna pay for it.

880
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,980
 It's not like a, man, the pastor's exempt,

881
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,000
 all of us will.

882
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,260
 If the people inside of your life and inside of my life

883
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,840
 are not following Jesus, if the people inside of your core

884
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
 and inside of my core are not seeking to encourage

885
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,960
 and motivate me in addition to following their faith

886
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,040
 and speaking the truth, you and I are not experiencing

887
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,680
 what God's design for us is as it relates to relationships.

888
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,520
 In conclusion, our friends are stronger

889
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,700
 than our convictions.

890
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,280
 Our friends will determine the future that you and I have.

891
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,740
 And then Solomon says, man, choose your friends carefully.

892
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,820
 Let me just address this last thing.

893
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,800
 I think that the biggest obstacle to this,

894
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,580
 the reason why so many of you are not gonna actually apply

895
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,820
 and not gonna do what Solomon says

896
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,580
 is because that emotional feeling of like,

897
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,700
 man, yeah, but I just can't leave my friends behind.

898
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,860
 Like, that just doesn't feel loyal and I care about 'em.

899
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,500
 And I really think, you know, they kinda need me

900
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,100
 and I need to be there for 'em and, you know,

901
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,380
 I can hang out with 'em on the weekend

902
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,720
 and just show 'em a light and still go

903
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,280
 to wherever they're going and I'll just kinda

904
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,480
 try to be different.

905
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,860
 And here's what I want you to know.

906
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,620
 You are leaving your friends behind

907
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,780
 by showing them a watered-down Christianity,

908
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,580
 a Christianity that really doesn't change kinda everything,

909
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,100
 that really doesn't do anything too dramatic,

910
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,580
 that still allows me to have one foot in the world

911
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
 and one foot out.

912
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,380
 You're leaving your friends behind.

913
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,780
 You are showing them and you're confusing them.

914
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,900
 You're showing them that, hey, this kinda faith thing

915
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,380
 is really not that big of a deal.

916
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,500
 You're like, like if you and your five closest friends

917
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
 got into a plane crash and you were the only one

918
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,620
 who was able physically to walk, everyone was injured

919
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,580
 to the point where they really couldn't walk

920
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,900
 and you were like, man, I would go get help for all of us

921
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,760
 but I don't wanna leave my friends behind.

922
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,860
 You were deciding you're gonna leave all of 'em behind.

923
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,580
 Forever.

924
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,260
 Or you can decide, man, I'm gonna go get help

925
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,900
 and then bring that help back.

926
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,900
 Bring others around that can help my friends.

927
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,340
 You, if you are deciding that I'm gonna kinda live

928
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,860
 this halfway in, halfway out Christianity,

929
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,360
 you're leaving those friends behind.

930
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,580
 You are doing the very thing that you're trying to avoid

931
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,600
 and it is confusing and it is hurting the name of Jesus.

932
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,980
 The God who is there is looking for a generation

933
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,820
 just like ours who will come together and say,

934
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,420
 man, we're gonna lock arms as believers in Jesus.

935
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,380
 Every single one of us needs one another.

936
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,300
 We need relationships of people who encourage us,

937
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,980
 hold us accountable and spur us on to love and good deeds,

938
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,140
 myself very much included, probably more than everybody here

939
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,500
 because I know that inside of my heart

940
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,400
 there's just a tendency to run from God,

941
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,180
 to run towards things that are gonna hurt my marriage,

942
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,860
 hurt my life, hurt me in general

943
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,220
 and every one of us needs that and here's what I know,

944
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,400
 the capacity or the ceiling on which God wants

945
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,860
 to use your life, wants to broaden the reach

946
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,580
 that you're gonna have in terms of reaching people,

947
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,420
 the ceiling on which he's gonna use that is capped.

948
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,140
 If you reject, what are the primary ways

949
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,740
 that he's gonna grow those roots deep

950
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,740
 which is the people of God inside of your life?

951
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,860
 Who's inside of your core?

952
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,680
 Are the closest relationships you have followers of Jesus?

953
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,100
 Are they following Jesus?

954
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,300
 Are they willing to speak the truth to you?

955
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,460
 They love you enough to speak the truth

956
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,540
 and are they encouraging you inside of your faith?

957
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,180
 Do you have people you're running with like that?

958
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,540
 In addition to this Sunday, tonight,

959
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,940
 you can go tonight upstairs afterwards,

960
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,020
 we have something called First Step,

961
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,560
 it's a chance for you to find out just the ways

962
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,020
 to connect and step forward into other relationships

963
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,260
 with believers, life is hard but it is so much harder

964
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,940
 when you walk through it alone and you were never

965
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,520
 intended to, even if you got friends,

966
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,540
 if they're not friends like the ones

967
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,580
 that Solomon describes and Paul lays out,

968
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,180
 they're not friends like God intends for you to have

969
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,860
 and me to have, let me pray.

970
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,560
 Father, thank you just for the wisdom that you gave us

971
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,940
 from Solomon and his Proverbs and his teachings,

972
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,980
 would you protect us through the provision

973
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,460
 of your people inside of our life?

974
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,060
 You say in Psalm 91 that he who dwells in the shelter

975
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,600
 of the Most High will abide in the shadow

976
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,980
 of the Almighty God and the shelter laid out

977
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,180
 all over scripture is your word and your people,

978
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,740
 would we abide in deep relationship with your people?

979
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,200
 And would we experience the protection and provision

980
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,700
 of you in that, I pray for my friends in the room

981
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,660
 who know that they need to walk away,

982
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,420
 who know that they need to change their playmates

983
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,580
 in their playground, that you would be enough,

984
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,960
 that you would win in their heart,

985
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,220
 in the midst of how challenging and difficult

986
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,380
 that really is to step towards new relationships,

987
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,020
 would you win and would you move my friends

988
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,940
 into deeper relationship with you

989
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,540
 through deepening their relationships

990
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,860
 with other Christ followers in their life?

991
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,740
 We worship you now in song, amen.
