[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [Music]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.560]   All right, let's go, let's go. How we doing porch? Hey, I'm pumped to be here. My name is
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.480]   Jadie, if we haven't met. I serve as the associate director here at the porch on
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.560]   Tuesday nights and I'm just thankful we get to do this. It's not beside me.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.200]   Y'all know this is crazy, right? Like this doesn't happen anywhere else in
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.880]   the world. Are we thankful to be here? Okay, I'm thankful to be here with you
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.080]   guys. I want to go ahead and say we are doing this series FAQ, frequently asked
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   questions. I'm gonna take off my typical kind of more pastor, you know, let's do
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   this, charge the mountain, Jadie, and put on my teacher hat and we're gonna learn
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.400]   together. So I hope you brought your journal, your pen, because we are gonna
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   tackle a pretty big question tonight. Before I do that, I want you guys to help
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.160]   me give a big shout and welcome to our friends tuning in from Porch Live, Fort
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.480]   Worth, Porch Live, North Houston, and Porch Live, Midland, Texas. Let them hear you in
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.160]   the room here in Dallas. Before we get to tonight's frequently asked question,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.840]   speaking of Midland, Texas, I want to tell you all about a time that I've only been
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.760]   to Midland one time. Anyone from Midland in the house? All right, two of you. That's
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.880]   what I thought. So before I worked at the porch, I lived in the great city of
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.240]   Collar Station, Texas. Any Aggies? A lot more than Midland, but when working at a
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   ministry there called Breakaway Ministries, we did this thing where we
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.600]   were like, "Hey, let's take Breakaway on the road for a summer. There's so many Aggies
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.720]   that go home for the summer that are missing Breakaway. Let's go to all of our
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.760]   major cities where there are different Aggies across the state of Texas." And our
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.920]   last stop was in the beautiful city of Midland, Texas. And so we go to Midland
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.240]   and we're like on the last leg of the tour, and so we kind of got this thing.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.640]   It's a well-oiled machine, and my job responsibilities were kind of passed
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   away, and I had one job. It was to get the director, Timothy Atik, who's now the
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.640]   teaching pastor here at Watermark with us. My job was to get TA to his host home
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.200]   after the event so he could sleep because he had a big day the next day or
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   something like that. So my job, drive him to his host home. So the night ends, he's
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640]   talking to people, everyone kind of goes away. We get in the car, I type in the
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.080]   address, we start driving. And you would think these people would set up a host
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.600]   homes are already in an awkward situation. If you've ever stayed
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.200]   somewhere that you don't know anyone, it's like you're coming in after
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.280]   midnight, they may be asleep. Do they know you're coming? You never met these people.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.560]   Is this the right address? Are you about to get taken out? You're walking into
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.200]   this home. Also, where am I supposed to know where the bedroom is? What if I open
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.600]   up the master bedroom? Like this is gonna be really awkward. So we're already kind
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.560]   of feeling uncomfortable. We're already kind of dreading this. But we're driving
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   and now we find ourselves yawning. We've like found ourselves at the end of the
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.280]   conversation. We're both tired. We're looking down and it's getting close to
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.000]   like 1 a.m. And so I'm like, "Surely something's wrong." And he's like, "JD, we
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.080]   got to be getting close to the house." I'm like, "Okay." It says one more turn, point
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.060]   one miles away. And we turn and I want y'all to imagine suddenly the road was
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.160]   no longer black, it was brown because we turn on this dirt road. And we start
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   taking off and the mask is still saying, "Go down this dirt road." So we're hitting
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.320]   all these bumps. I mean we're in the middle of the desert region of West
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.360]   Texas. There are tumbleweeds. There are like, what are they, jackrabbits? Jackalopes?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.920]   Like up to my hip. There are huge rabbits. That's all I remember. Running across
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.800]   like looking at us like, "What up? What up?" I'm like, "The rabbits here are insane." And
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.040]   so I remember driving and all of a sudden it dawned on us like we looked
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.560]   around and you could not see a house, a building in sight. Like if it were
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.600]   daytime and you could zoom out, you would hear like, "Hello, hello, hello." Birds, you
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.280]   know, in the tree fly away. Like we were in the middle of nowhere with some
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   coyotes. And so I look over at him and I'm like, "This can't be right." He's like,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.000]   "JD, we are in the middle of nowhere. Like where are we going?" And he looks at a text
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.920]   and he looks at my address that I typed in and I look at the address that was
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.340]   sent to him and the address had four numbers and I had one number off. I was
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.400]   given the wrong information. And so long story short, we type in his address, put
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.320]   in the right information, turn around, head back, awkwardly come in at like 1:30
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.760]   in the morning and go to sleep. Why do I start there? Information matters. Right
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.000]   information matters even more. Our information in that moment, the wrong
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.640]   information led us to the wrong destination. We found ourselves lost,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.520]   worried, alone, confused. And I think a lot of us, because we've been given wrong
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.240]   information, we find ourselves often confused, searching, empty, wondering,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.920]   guilty, shameful, because information determines destination. For the Christian,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.880]   it's really important that accurate information plus application will result
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.760]   in the right destination. That's why we're tackling this series. A lot of
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.000]   people aren't willingly inviting really controversial, hard topics to the stage
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.840]   because they understand all the different convictions and gray areas and
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.280]   opinions and the ways that you could potentially upset people, but we are
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.960]   committed to you guys to inform you with accurate, biblical keyword, biblical
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.160]   truth that is never changing, not shaped by culture, but shaped and defined by God.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.000]   Because we believe all those salvation is given by faith alone. God is so kind
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.880]   to us as his children, he does not make us operate by faith alone. With God's
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.680]   Word, with God's people, with God's Spirit, we have so many answers that can help
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.720]   inform us, inform our faith, inform our life, inform our walk, and actually
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.680]   strengthen our faith. Because we do have answers. So that's how we talk about
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.440]   things like sexuality in the church. That's how we talk about things like
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.560]   messing up God's will for our life. And that's how we talk about things like the
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   question we're asking tonight. The question we're asking, write this down, is
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   "Can a Christian lose their salvation?" Can a Christian lose their salvation? If you
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   were to go to GotQuestions, one of the most top Christian kind of resources
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.920]   online, it gives you the top listed 20 questions asked in the world. This
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.200]   question is the fourth most asked question on GotQuestions. "Can a
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.520]   Christian lose their salvation?" This question divides and literally creates
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.760]   different denominations because different people interpret Scripture in
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.480]   a different way, resulting in some people believing that you can or cannot lose
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.920]   your salvation. And I believe the reason why we got to talk about this is because
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.880]   what you believe on the other side of this question has huge implications on
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.400]   your life. Freedom and flourishing are an outcome of what you believe to be the
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.000]   answer to this question. Because for some of you, you might have been born into a
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.880]   Christian home, gone to a church, been raised in the church, said a prayer at
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   VBS, and then at youth camp, and then kind of went off the path in college, and now
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.960]   because your friends come to the porch, you found yourself at the porch, and
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240]   every Tuesday you find yourself coming back to God again and being like, "I'm
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.720]   sorry for what I did." And I sit with young adults time and time again, and I
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.320]   ask this question. They say, "Yeah, I'm a Christian. Yeah, I grew up in a Christian
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.920]   home." And as we start to talk about the faith more, I just say, "Hey, on a scale of
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.040]   one to ten, if a ten is I'm absolutely positively sure that I will get into
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.720]   heaven, where do you land?" And the people who say, "Yeah, I'm a Christian," often
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:29.440]   look at me and go, "Huh, that's a good question. I think a five. I think a seven." I
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.280]   ask, "Well, why do you, if you're a Christian, why are you not a ten?" And as I got my
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.320]   heart wrapped around this question, I did a lot of research and a lot of different
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.720]   studying of what the Bible has to say about this topic. What I've come to
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   realize is most people who are coming into the church, they aren't actually
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.280]   wrestling with the idea of losing their salvation. They are actually wrestling
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.600]   with if they have ever been saved to begin with. Because when they look at
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.920]   their life and they look at the path they've taken, and if right now I were to
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.420]   ask you to imagine the moment if you were to get in a car ride on your way
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.960]   home and you were standing for God Himself, and He were to look at your life
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   and to say, "Hey, should I let you in?" What would you say? I know for me, I wrestled
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.640]   with texts like in Matthew chapter 7 where it says, "Many people will stand
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.920]   before me in the day that Jesus returns," and they'll say, "Didn't I go to church in
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.520]   your name? Didn't I prophesy in your name? Didn't I go on mission trips in your name?
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   Look at all I did for you!" And Jesus will say, "Depart from me. I never knew you." That
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.320]   question haunted me for most of my life because I always wanted the back of my
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.040]   mind, "Did I lose my salvation? Did I ever have salvation?" And because of that, it
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.640]   prevented me from freedom and flourishing, and that's where the enemy
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   likes to keep us. The enemy wants to keep us. It's a perfect sweet spot for him where if
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.520]   he could have you coming to the church time and time again, and you come to a
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.400]   place that's meant to offer freedom, healing, and restoration, yet you walk out
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.440]   fearful, afraid, enslaved, because you don't truly know where you're at with
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.960]   God. So here's my prayer for this message tonight. For the person who knows
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.480]   that you know that you know, that you're like, "I'm a 10," I hope this message, first
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.120]   off, educates you how to educate others, but secondly, I hope it just strengthens
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.520]   your faith that you just want to press in and love God more until you're with
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.480]   him. For the person tonight who's wrestling, who would say, "I don't know
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.160]   where I'm at," I hope that this message requires you to wrestle. I'm okay with
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.760]   the wrestling. I want you to be honest tonight with God. Don't be distracted. Put
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.280]   your phone down. This could be the most important conversation you've
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.720]   ever heard, and God could be wanting to speak to you tonight so that you can
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.920]   stop the exhaustion that comes with wrestling, and you could be assured,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:00.520]   because assurance is possible for every person in this room. There is an answer
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   to the question, a black and white answer, a yes or no, to can you lose your
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   salvation if you are a Christian, and we're gonna tackle it. So let's do it.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.120]   Pen, paper, everyone ready? Say yeah. All right, here we go. To answer if a
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.800]   Christian can lose their salvation, we must first ask the question, "Well, what
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.560]   actually is a Christian? What is a Christian actually?" I think we have to
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   start here, because right now, it's like, "Hey, what's a Christian?" You'd have like a
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.320]   churchy answer. You'd have a one-liner answer, but the reality is Christianity
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:41.000]   and what a Christian is in 2022 is a mess. The word Christian has lost its
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.320]   meaning through and through, time and time again. Ladies and some men, you
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:52.920]   really know this, because what happens? You see Christian in that Hinge bio. Do
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.520]   you think, "I'm absolutely sure, because it says it." Bio means like biography, his
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   life. This guy, his life is marked by Christian. No, no, what do you do? You're
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.380]   like, "Uh-huh, I'll believe it when I see it. They all are Christians." Because the
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.040]   reality is, and I even tripping, "Fellas, we deal with the same thing. Girls will
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:21.480]   have the verse in their bio, and then they're like, "Never mind." But times have
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:31.040]   changed. Anyways, that is not the talk tonight. Dating series coming soon. But
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.360]   here's the thing. The reason why you want to see their life is because you know
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.440]   Christianity is not merely putting something on a description. Christianity
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.800]   is not something that you just say that you are when it's convenient to you to
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.720]   pick up someone, or when you're around your grandparents and they want to be
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.840]   proud of you, or when you want to get a job and you know the boss is a Christian
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.320]   owner or a Christian establishment. Christianity or being a Christian has
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.800]   nothing to do with you. It's not about praying a prayer when you were seven or
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.400]   at a youth camp. It's not about going to church. It's not about coming to the
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.040]   porch. It's not about the time that your parents had you sprinkled at your
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.160]   grandma's church when you were a child. Christianity... I was sprinkled. Any of my
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.920]   sprinkle friends out there? That was me.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.480]   That's not what Christianity is. Christianity is not religion. Christianity
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.200]   is not being judgmental. Christianity is not someone who has high moral values.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.800]   And we have to start with an understanding. If I'm gonna be able to
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.680]   answer the question, "Can a Christian lose their salvation?" I have to
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:39.400]   make sure that you and I are aligned on what we know to be a Christian is. What is
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:50.040]   a Christian? So, because one of the main things that we'll see when we get to
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.400]   heaven, God is... it's called Judgment Day, and God is going to look at all people
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.920]   and he's going to tell you, "Were you living like I called you to or were you
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.080]   not? Were you truly a Christian?" If right now I call myself an NBA player, does
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.400]   that make me an NBA player? No. I could have the jersey. I could go to the games.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   I could play the pickup game. But if I really... if you wanted to know, "Is JD
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.640]   actually an NBA player?" Where would you go? You go to the roster. You would go and
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.400]   you would look at all the rosters of all the teams to see, and guess what? Shocker,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.240]   shocker, you're not gonna find my name. With Christianity, you can wear the jersey.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:42.400]   You can come to the game that is church. You can sit on the sidelines. You can
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.480]   play church. You can have the cross tattoo. You can have the Jesus necklace.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.560]   You can wear the Jesus loves you hoodie. But one day, there's gonna be a roster,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.880]   and it's called the Lamb's Book of Life, and it's gonna have every player in that
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.600]   book. And God's not gonna worry about how the world defined Christianity. He's not
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.920]   gonna ask how culture defined Christianity. He's not gonna ask how you
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.840]   define Christianity. He's gonna want to know, "Did you live like I called you to
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:25.120]   live according to my word for me?" It's so important that we can define what a
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.200]   Christian is, not for how it makes us feel or how it betters our life, but how
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:38.080]   God defines it. So looking at the Bible, how does God define Christianity? We're
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.920]   gonna do this through a little illustration over here. Teacher JD is on.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:50.720]   Here we go. First, a Christian is justified. Say justified. Say justified.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   What does it mean to be justified? This is language of a courtroom. God is the
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:04.760]   judge. We are the suspect. We have committed a crime against God. That crime
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:12.680]   is sin. God is holy. He cannot be in the presence of sinful man. And we were
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:20.280]   called to depart from our sin, to choose God, and what did we do? We chose sin time
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.480]   and time again. And the more we chose our flesh, the more we gave in to that
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.600]   temptation, the more separated and separated we were from God, the more that
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.200]   we were due a punishment. That punishment, eternal separation from Him in a place
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.400]   called hell. Totally away from God. The worst punishment that a man can ever
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.840]   experience. That's where we were at. But luckily for us, Romans 5.1 says, "Therefore
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:54.760]   since you have been justified by faith, you have peace with God through our Lord
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   Jesus Christ." So I want you to imagine the scene in the courtroom. God is
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.180]   sitting there as the judge. He's looking down at you, the prosecutor. He's saying,
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:09.840]   "Hey, you have been found guilty. You have committed sin, a major crime against me.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:18.280]   Your punishment is death." And right when he's about to say guilty, Jesus steps
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.920]   into the scene. "Therefore since we have been justified by faith through who? Our
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:32.600]   Lord Jesus Christ." Jesus stands up and says, "I'll take it. I'll take it. Give the
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:38.080]   death to me. Give the penalty to me. I'll take it." How did he do that? He came down
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.200]   to earth. He walked earth in skin and he had bones just like us. He was fully God
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.480]   and fully man. The difference in us is he was gonna be the atonement for our sins.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:56.200]   The perfect sacrifice for our sins. The payment for our sins. How did he do that?
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:02.880]   He remained perfect in every way, making him an appropriate payment for our
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.600]   penalty. He lived on the earth 33 years. He then died a sinner's death on a cross.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.280]   He hung there and on that cross he took every sin that you committed against God
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:22.640]   that deserved death. He took it and he died in your place on the cross. And if
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.600]   you put your faith in that, what happens? You are justified. You are now a
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.160]   Christian because you've been justified by faith. You were once
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.960]   opposed to God. Now therefore, because we have been justified by faith, we now have
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:47.280]   peace with God. Because of the death, burial, and resurrection, Jesus went into
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.600]   the grave three days. Three days later he rose from the grave conquering sin,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.040]   conquering your shame, your guilt. So now you don't have to be afraid of death. You
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:05.000]   don't have to be afraid of a penalty. You can stand free before God. Because of
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.960]   Jesus, you are justified. Once opposed, now at peace. But how do we obtain this peace
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.600]   with God? Not by works, but by faith. Ephesians 2, 8 through 9 says, "It's for by
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.200]   grace you have been saved through faith. This is not of your own doing. It's a
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:30.800]   free gift of God, not as a result of works that no man can boast." We have
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.120]   nothing to do with this. We have nothing to do with this story. It has everything
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:46.080]   to do with what Jesus has done in our place. You were justified because of
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:56.840]   Jesus. All because of Jesus. A lot of times when I sit down with people and
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.960]   they're questioning, "Okay, I think I want to be a Christian. I just don't know how."
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.680]   And if I were to stand before God and he were to ask me, "Hey, why should I let you
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.800]   into heaven?" Well, I look at him and I say, "Well, let's say you're standing before God
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.760]   and he asks you, 'Why should I let you into heaven?'" And here's oftentimes what
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.840]   they'll say. "Well, because I..." I'll go, "Eh." We'll talk some more and we'll flesh it out
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.280]   some more. I'll say, "For by grace you've been justified through faith. This is not
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.800]   of your own works. It's nothing to do with you. It's the gift of God." So then
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.240]   I'll say, "You're standing before God. You died. You're there. You're seeing God. And he
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   says, 'Why should I let you in?'" "Well, because I..." "Eh." So then go back. We'll go back.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.440]   We'll go back. Okay. Not because of anything you've done. It's the great
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.480]   exchange. You did nothing. You got everything. You're standing before God.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:57.720]   And he says, "Why should I let you in?" And it's like, the lights go off. And every time,
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:05.800]   a big smile. And they go, "Because Jesus." And I grab and I'm like, "Yeah, let's do it! Let's do it! Because Jesus!"
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:12.400]   And I'm like, "That's right!" And they're like, "Because Jesus took my sin on the cross. He paid it. He went to the
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.240]   grave for me. Now I can be free. No more shame. No more guilt. That's why. Because
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:26.080]   of Jesus." And I'm like, "Yeah!" And they're like, "What do I do now?" And I'm like, "It's not like, 'Ugh, I can feel it!' It's not like that."
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.320]   But we are told in Romans 10, 9 through 10, "And if you confess with your mouth
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.440]   that Jesus is Lord, He's not just your friend. He's Lord. He's worth your all.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.120]   He's worth your surrender. If you will confess that Jesus did do this for you
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.760]   over 2,000 years ago. He did die on the cross. He did defeat sin. He did pay your
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.120]   payment that you deserve, that you owe to God. If you will confess with your mouth
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.600]   that He is Lord, and you will not just say it, you will not just put it on your
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.840]   bio or tattoo it on your arm, but you will tattoo it to your heart. You'll
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   believe in your heart that God, through the power of the Holy Spirit, raised Him
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.120]   from the dead. You will be saved. For with the mouth, one confesses and is saved.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.200]   With the heart, one believes and is justified." That's what the Bible tells us.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.360]   So then I say, "Do you want to confess with your mouth and believe with your
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:20.280]   heart?" They say, "Yeah. Yeah, I do." And in that moment, salvation takes place and they
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.640]   become a part of the family of God. They are justified. And they're not just
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:32.320]   justified though. Then they become verified. Everyone's trying to be verified
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.040]   on Instagram. You don't have to be verified on Instagram. You can be verified
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.920]   by what? By the Holy Spirit. Because upon being justified, upon being saved, becoming
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.540]   a Christian, one of the biggest marks of a Christian is they are sealed with the
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:57.520]   Holy Spirit. Say, "Verified." Say, "Verified." By who? The Holy Spirit. Ephesians chapter 1.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.120]   Here's what it says in verse 13. "In Him you also, when you heard the word of
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.320]   truth," so the word of truth, what I just proclaimed, "the gospel of your salvation,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.800]   the good news of Jesus Christ and what He's done for you, and believed in Him,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.080]   were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of your
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:22.600]   inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise of His glory." I want
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.000]   to keep this one pretty simple. We know, when we think of the word "verified," like I
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.920]   said, on Instagram, the blue badge. I want to rant for just a second. I think it's,
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.880]   the blue badge is losing its power for me. It doesn't mean anything. I go on
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.360]   there sometimes, I see people with like 2,000 followers with the blue badge, and
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.040]   I'm like, "How did you, there's some kind of black market, shady stuff happening
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.480]   behind the scenes. People are getting these blue badges and now it's losing
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   its meaning." Because why? What was the blue badge intended to do? It was intended to
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:58.020]   verify and say, "Hey, this is truly who I am. Anyone else that tries to use my
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:03.140]   username, anyone else that tries to claim to be this brand, this is the one.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:12.960]   This badge verifies who I am and where I belong." I'll just say it. Some of you,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.600]   you got this blue badge, you got like 200,000 followers, 28 likes, bots, bots,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.560]   bots. You've been buying those followers. I'm just gonna say you need to repent
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.280]   and you can get rid of them, okay? But,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:36.640]   verified, that blue check says, "Hey, this is who I am. This is me." In the same way,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   Paul says in Ephesians chapter 1, that the Holy Spirit, upon salvation, comes
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:50.240]   inside of you and now he verifies you. Romans chapter 8 tells us that the
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.060]   Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, bears witness now with the Spirit inside of us
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:01.240]   and it sees us now as a child of God. We now are identified as a son and a
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.440]   daughter of God because the Holy Spirit identifies and verifies the Spirit in us.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.200]   Upon salvation, we are given the promised Holy Spirit, but we're not just given
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.960]   him, we are sealed in him. This language comes from, I literally just learned how
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.200]   to do this, so bear with me. I'm not gonna do it right now, but anyone know what
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.480]   this is? This thing? I don't even know what it's called, actually. So, if someone knows, let me
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.160]   know. It's like a stamp seal thing of like the olden days. The people that are
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.440]   really bougie put on their wedding invitations, okay? So, this right here is a
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:45.280]   seal made by this. I did it myself. These are wax beads. I took the wax beads, I put
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.000]   them inside this thing, and people thought I had a meth lab in the back.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.840]   Because then I take it and I took a lighter and I opened flame, burnt them
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:05.000]   mugs, and so then after I burnt the wax, I then poured the wax onto this envelope
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.280]   right where it closes it, and then I took this guy and I stamped it. I sealed it.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:19.160]   The reason why they would use these back in the day is because the only way that
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.880]   this could be opened was when it got into the proper hands of the recipient,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   the proper recipient of the letter. If the letters would get to the person it
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.040]   was meant to go to, and if any way it were opened, because once these seals are
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.160]   broken you cannot reseal them. You can't. So, if it ever got to someone and it was
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:45.720]   broken, that person went through severe punishment. Because these types of seals,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.200]   once broken, cannot be resealed. And it was really important that the letter was
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.280]   not tampered with, especially back in the war days, because he wanted to make sure
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:02.200]   that it was valid or verified information going to the proper hands. So
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.720]   they create a seal that could not be broken until given to the right person.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:15.000]   You are sealed with the Holy Spirit upon salvation and it cannot be broken. It
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   says one day it guarantees that you will get the inheritance. You will be in
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:24.160]   heaven with God. He is the receiver of you and then he will see the Holy Spirit
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.440]   as your seal. The Holy Spirit will be what verifies you and because of the
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.320]   Holy Spirit in you, you will now be with him and experience your inheritance in
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:41.720]   heaven. So upon salvation you become a Christian when you are justified, but not
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.800]   only just justified by faith apart from works, you now are verified with and
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   sealed with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has many roles in the life of the
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:59.760]   believer. Not only does it verify us, not only does it empower us, but it also
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.080]   sanctifies us. The third thing that marks a Christian is that they
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:13.440]   are sanctified. A Christian is being sanctified from sin. This is one of the
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.600]   biggest... You have to understand what sanctification is for the life
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.200]   of the Christian. What it means. Because this is where we kind of start getting
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.760]   into the whole conversation of religion versus relationship. If you don't
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.800]   understand why we have sanctification, why we're called to be sanctified. What
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.760]   is sanctification? Sanctification is basically when you become a Christian,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.440]   when you are born again and given the Spirit of God, you now are called to be
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.600]   sanctified. Which means that you are gonna learn the things of Christ through
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.760]   His Word and through His Church and through His Spirit. You're gonna learn
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.880]   the things of Christ to begin to look more like Christ. 2nd Corinthians 5 17
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:58.120]   says, "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.040]   away, the new has come." Notice it did not say improved. You are an improved
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:12.120]   creation. You're not a better version of yourself. You are a 100% new
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.080]   creation. I think a lot of you wrestle with your salvation because you
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.120]   proclaimed with your mouth that Jesus was Lord, yet you did not make Him Lord
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.640]   of your life. And you're supposed to look new, but yet you still look like the
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.960]   world. And it makes you confused. Because nothing changed. But when you encounter
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.720]   Jesus, when you encounter the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the power of God
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.840]   comes inside of you, suddenly going out doesn't hit like it once did. Bottle
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.360]   service isn't as fun as it once was. You and your girlfriend, y'all hook up and
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   now, dang it, I feel guilty after. What is this? Lingering on social media,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.760]   watching those things on Netflix, listening to that kind of provocative
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:03.560]   music. Those things just aren't doing it anymore. Why? Because you're new.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.160]   Because now you are a new creation and you, because of the Holy Spirit in you, is
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:15.080]   being sanctified. You are being sanctified, renewed, day by day, looking
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:22.120]   more like Christ. The Bible refers a lot to us in our spiritual walk as we begin
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.720]   when we're born again. It's that illustration that we become like an
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.880]   infant and we need milk. We need spiritual milk. But as we mature and
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.240]   become more sanctified, more like Christ, we go from milk to solid food, that we
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.480]   can start to understand the more mature aspects of Christianity. Some of
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.520]   you, you question your salvation because you've been a Christian since you were
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:47.240]   seven, yet you're still on milk. There's no evidence of a readiness to
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.280]   encounter solid, mature food. You don't know God's Word. You don't know
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.960]   how to be called out by community. You don't know how to be active in your
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.400]   church. You wonder why you don't see God do a great work in your life. It's
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:05.160]   because he's still small in your life. He's not God of your life. And so I'm
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:12.000]   here to tell you that sanctification, it is not popular, it's not sexy, it's not
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.560]   trendy, but on the other side of that obedience is where you will see the most
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.080]   flourishing in fruit and intimacy and thriving in your gifts and calling like
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.560]   you were created to. It's who you were created to be in Christ. You cannot claim
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.920]   to love God and not make him Lord, not be obedient to God in his Word. You're
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:41.680]   called to be sanctified. Romans 6, I believe, tells us that just like you are
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.560]   alive in Christ, you died like Christ. You died to your own self. Therefore, how can
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.800]   someone who says they died to their sins still live in it? He talks about abusing
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.560]   God's grace. Just because God's grace is overflowing for you, you shouldn't
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   just say, "Well, I'll do this because I'll get more grace. I'll get more grace." No, he
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:06.600]   says, "To love me is to be like me. Be holy as I am holy." Holiness just means set
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:14.160]   apart. If you look like the world and you're supposed to be looking like Jesus,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.840]   how are you doing? Talking about sanctification, I can't help but talk
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.560]   about my marriage. It's full of sanctification.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.480]   Hi, Jenna. I love you, girl. I was actually being sanctified last night. I made more
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.440]   like Jesus, laying down my life. In marriage, here's what's funny. I think
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.320]   when I was single, I thought that when I was married, everything would feel
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.520]   immensely different. We joke all the time because you're like, "We're
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.320]   married!" Everyone's like, "Sparklers!" You run out and you're getting the
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.560]   card. You're like, "We just have an adrenaline rush." Then you do
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.720]   stuff and you go to sleep. I'm like, "Am I just gonna skip over that?"
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:07.520]   I'm gonna be more sanctified tonight after saying that.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:16.640]   The next morning, though, I remember laying there and being like, "I'm
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:26.720]   married." I'm like, "Is this real?" Then I turn over and I see a girl in my bed.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.480]   I'm like, "Boop, boop!" I poked her for like two weeks. I'm like, "Is this real?"
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:41.880]   Why? Because I entered into this new relationship and it felt weirdly no
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.800]   different. But the reality was everything was different. Everything was different
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:57.720]   forever. What now it requires of me in this relationship with Jenna is that
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:04.040]   as I seek to love her more, I must first seek to love God more. As I seek to
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.240]   love her more, I'm now thinking of myself less. I'm loving her more because I'm
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.880]   loving God more. In that process, I'm realizing how selfish I am, how many
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.680]   problems I got, how frustrated I can be, how prideful I can be. I'm being
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.600]   sanctified. You don't have to be married to be sanctified. You are called to be
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.840]   sanctified the moment you enter into this relationship with God. I think a
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.520]   lot of us, we think salvation, becoming Christians, are gonna be this huge
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:38.480]   feeling that takes place. Obedience, it's not because of some feeling that, "Oh, I do
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.800]   this to get some feeling." No, no, you do it despite what you feel because you love
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.480]   Him. That's what sanctification looks like. A Christian is marked by
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:54.880]   sanctification. And then lastly, a Christian is not only sanctified, not
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.760]   only verified, not only justified, but we are glorified. Praise God, hallelujah. We
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   will be in glory. Another way of saying that is we will be one day made
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:12.480]   completely new in heaven. We live a life now of sanctification to look more like
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.400]   Jesus until one day we are truly restored and like Him in our glorified
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:24.680]   bodies in heaven. How do I know this? John 3, 16. A verse we all learn. "For God so
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.120]   loved thee that he gave his one and only begotten, that whoever believes in him
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:36.560]   shall not perish but have everlasting eternal," tomato, tomato, "you have eternal
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:45.000]   life." God gave his son so you could be glorified in eternal life forever with
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.200]   him. But here's the thing. To get heaven, you have to first put your faith in
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:00.600]   Jesus who justifies you. I think because a lot of us have followed religion for
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.720]   most of our lives, we live with a mentality that to get heaven we operate
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.400]   out of a performance-based acceptance mentality that I will be accepted into
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.680]   heaven based off my performance. But a relationship with God, the mark of a
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.000]   Christian is someone who understands, no, no, no, I operate out of an acceptance-based
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.280]   performance with God. I do not perform to be accepted. I do things. I become
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:34.700]   sanctified. I follow God's commands because I've been accepted. This is the
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.700]   process of becoming a Christian and it is really important that you don't put
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:49.360]   doing for God before being justified by Christ. If you had to do to receive,
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.920]   sanctification would be right here in the process. You would do things to be
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.680]   like God to get God. But Romans 5:8 tells us that God demonstrated his own love
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:07.160]   towards us that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. While we were
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.920]   still sinners, Christ died for us. Therefore, you don't get heaven, you don't
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.480]   get accepted by God because of what you've done. It's all about faith and
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:23.840]   what Jesus has done for you. And if you would believe that, if you would believe
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.520]   that it's because of Christ, it's in Christ and through Christ, that's
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:39.040]   embarrassing, it's in Christ that you are justified, verified, sanctified, and
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.400]   glorified all because... You don't gotta clap and make me feel better about it being
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:50.040]   upside down. No, but you can't clap for Jesus because in Christ, in Christ, and
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.600]   through Christ, because of Christ and him alone, you can be a Christian. You can be
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.320]   Christ-like. That's what makes a Christian. By faith alone, not by works,
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:08.440]   the Spirit in you, being like Christ until you're with him in glory. So now to
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:15.880]   answer our question, if this is what God defines as a Christian, can a Christian
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:24.240]   lose their salvation? Can a Christian lose their salvation? Studying the Bible,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:30.520]   studying interpretations, biblically the answer, just point blank, is absolutely
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:37.640]   not. In no way, shape, or form can a true Christian indwell by the Spirit of God
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:43.560]   according to the power of God for the glory of God through Christ alone. Can
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:50.020]   they lose their salvation? And I'm gonna answer it quickly using the same
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:58.560]   illustration of why we know that's true. If a Christian is justified by faith
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:06.240]   alone, not by works, like Ephesians 2, 8 through 9 says. Titus 3, 5 also says that
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.920]   he saved us, not because of our righteousness, but according to his own
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.760]   mercy by the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Spirit. He saved
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.680]   us not because of works. If we are justified and we did nothing to earn our
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.280]   salvation, that means there's nothing that we can do to lose our salvation. If
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:35.000]   you did nothing to earn it, there's nothing you can do to lose it. If your
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.560]   actions could dictate your salvation, that means that your actions determined
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.640]   your salvation. But it had nothing to do with your actions. We just talked all
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:53.520]   about it. It was everything that Jesus did for you. So just like you didn't get
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:00.040]   your salvation, you can't, there's nothing you can do to lose your salvation. Also,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:06.080]   to be justified by Christ means that Christ was the perfect payment for your
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.880]   sins. To say that there's something that you can do that would take you from
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   justified to guilty would mean that when Jesus stood up and said, "I'll take the
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   payment," God said, "Jesus, you're not enough." No, because they're gonna do this
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.800]   action down the road that your blood will not be able to cover. To say that
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.840]   there's something that you could do to lose your salvation would mean and
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.960]   diminish, it would diminish the power of what Jesus has done for you. It would
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.760]   mean that the blood of Christ covers just part of you but not all of you. But
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.960]   we know that that's not true. We see it in 1 Peter chapter 1. "For you know that
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.520]   God paid a ransom." He paid his one and only Son to save you from the empty life
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:58.160]   you inherited from your ancestors. It was not paid with mere gold or silver, which
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.680]   loses their value. It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless spotless
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:10.800]   lamb of God. Everything Jesus did to pay for you paid for it all. It was perfect
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:17.520]   in every way. It covered every sin of the world, past, present, and future. To say
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.000]   that there's something you can do that means that you could lose your salvation
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.240]   means there's something that Jesus has done that wasn't enough. So in the same
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.800]   way that there's nothing you did to get it, you can't do anything to lose it, and
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.040]   the same way that you could say, "Well, something I've done could have me lose
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.680]   it," that means that what Jesus has done is not enough. The next thing that we see,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.280]   there's something that you can do to lose your salvation. It would mean that
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   you were actually never verified. You were actually never sealed with the
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.200]   Spirit. Whenever I take one of these envelopes, and it doesn't have the seal
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.040]   on it as you can see, this is one of those like, you know, clothes, I don't trust those
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.360]   kind of envelopes. I put tape on it still even after looking at that thing.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.400]   Because I don't trust it. I don't trust that it won't be popped open. That's
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.120]   basically what you're saying. If you can revoke your salvation, you are saying
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:14.840]   that the Holy Spirit could be unsealed. That the Holy Spirit won't keep His
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.040]   promise to give you your inheritance. What is your inheritance? Glory. Eternal
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   life. John 3:16 says that we will, as Christians, receive eternal life. If
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.360]   there's something that you can do to take back the gift of eternal life, was
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.760]   it ever truly eternal? If you get eternity, that gift, upon salvation, and
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.400]   let's say I gave you a gift, and I said you can have it forever, and I walk away
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.360]   for a few years, and then I come back and I say, "Okay, I want it back." What did
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.640]   forever mean? It didn't mean forever. That's what you're saying God is doing
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.800]   to you. That He's basically this Indian giver. That He gives you the gift of
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   eternal life, and then, "Oh, but you did that thing. Okay, it's not eternal. I want it
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.640]   back." To say that you can lose your salvation is to change the definition of
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:09.040]   the gift of eternal life that you receive the moment you are saved. So to
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.560]   say you can lose your salvation, to say that God is not trustworthy, that God
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.760]   will take back what He's promised, and God will take back the gift that He's
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.280]   given to you, all three of those things are inconsistent with what the Bible says is
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:27.800]   the character of God. God is trustworthy. God has given the gift of His Son in
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.600]   eternal life, really, and He's not taking it back, no matter what you've done. The
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.840]   two biggest oppositions to this question, people say, "What about the Christian who
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.240]   lives in unrepentant sin?" They get that from Hebrews chapter 10, verse 26. If you
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.680]   want to talk about the context of how that's written to the Jews, and how the
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.320]   Jews at the time did not believe that Christ was the Messiah, and all that
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.920]   Hebrews meant for them, and the supremacy of Christ, come down front. We'll talk
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.720]   about it. I don't have time. But they say, "What about the Christian who lives in
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   unrepentant sin?" The second opposition is out of Hebrews chapter 6, verses 4
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.480]   through 8, and they ask, "What about the person who was a proclaimed they were in
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.960]   the faith, but then they went away from the faith? They're now practicing a
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.480]   different lifestyle. They're an atheist." The problem with these two oppositions
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.880]   is they come with the assumption that these people were actually Christians to
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.900]   begin with. That's why I spent three-fourths of this message defining
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.760]   what a Christian is, because that is the force behind this argument. If
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.160]   you are someone who lives in unrepentant sin, 1 John chapter 3, verse 6, says
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.960]   that if you know God, if you abide in Him, you will not continue a life of sin.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:37.640]   1 John also actually says that if you walked with us, and you looked like
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:45.360]   us, and then you walked away, you were never one of us. 1 John chapter 2, 23
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.240]   through 24, it says, "No one who denies the Son has the Father." No one who denies the
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.320]   Son has the Father. So if there's any point in your life where you say, "No, I don't
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.800]   believe Jesus has done this for me," you do not have the Father. You never had the
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.200]   Father. That's what the Bible would teach in 1 John. Look it up. Chapters 1, 2,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.520]   and 3. They might have been religious at one point. They might have been in
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.600]   church at one point. They might have done cool spiritual things at one point, but
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:17.320]   the Bible teaches us that they did not have a relationship with God. So I could
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:23.320]   go on and on with all the scriptures that point to the confidence that we can have
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:29.480]   and possess in our salvation. There's just an overwhelming amount of how God
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.000]   just confirms time and time again in Romans chapter 8, "There's nothing you can
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.440]   do to separate you from the love of God." Nothing. Nothing. The word "nothing," what's
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.600]   it mean? Nothing. There's nothing you can do to separate God from his children. In
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:50.680]   John chapter 10, it's a lot of words in a short amount of time. John chapter 10,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:56.280]   Jesus says there's no nothing, nothing on earth in this world that can snatch us
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:03.080]   out of our Father's hand. Luke chapter 15 talks about how Jesus, He gives this
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.640]   analogy of a lost sheep and how He gladly, gladly takes ownership of leaving
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:14.800]   the 99 to go after the one. That's the character of who our God is. He goes
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.600]   after the rebellious. He goes after the child who's wayward. He goes after, He
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.080]   waits for the prodigal son to return. He doesn't reject. He doesn't push away. Yes,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.920]   can you walk away from salvation? Can you walk off the path of a relationship with
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.360]   God? Sure, but God is not walking away from you. He has not walking away from
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.640]   you and He is right here calling you tonight. If you have been wrestling, if
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.120]   you could not say you're a 10, if you have been wondering where you are at
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.400]   with God, it's time to stop wrestling and it's time to know that you know that you
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.120]   know because on the other side of that assurance is flourishing. There's freedom
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:47:00.520]   and the life of a Christian is meant to be marked by freedom. And so if you're in
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.200]   any place tonight going, "Yeah, I don't know. I'm standing before God and I don't
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.040]   know if I'm saved. I don't know if I'm not saved." That can change. So here's what I
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.600]   want to do. I want everyone to bow your head, close your eyes, and I just want to
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:26.040]   take a moment and I want to ask this question. I want you to ask the question,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:33.160]   first off, 1 to 10. 10, I am confident that I am going to be glorified. I'm gonna see
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:39.080]   Jesus face to face. God is going to let me in heaven, not because of anything
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:46.720]   I've done. I'm confident. Where are you at? Scale of 1 to 10.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:54.480]   There's some of you that maybe you are wayward. Maybe you come here tonight and
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.360]   you don't know where you're at with God. Sure, yeah, you believe there is a God and
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:04.280]   sure, yeah, maybe there was a moment that you professed him as Lord but he hasn't
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:10.120]   fully been Lord of your life. Your life would look nothing like a new life. Sure,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:16.360]   you prayed a prayer but nothing changed and you want change. You want to be
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.520]   sanctified. You want to look more like Jesus.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:25.440]   Maybe for some of you, you've been struggling with an addiction or a secret
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:31.960]   sin for so long and you're terrified to one day stand before God and you're
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:38.600]   terrified that you might hear the words, "Depart from me, I never knew you."
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.680]   Wherever you're at tonight with your relationship with God, my prayer for
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.080]   tonight's message is that we would no longer continue the exhausting life of
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.640]   wrestling but we would know. We would know where we stand. We wouldn't be
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:59.800]   lukewarm. We would be all in. So here's what I'm gonna ask you to do. If that is you
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.440]   tonight, if you're tired of coming to the porch every week and praying the same
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:10.400]   prayer and having nothing change, if you want to truly go all in with Jesus, it
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.080]   might be uncomfortable and I'm gonna ask you to stand up right now.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:24.240]   I'm gonna ask you to stand up. I'm gonna ask you, like I said, Romans chapter 10
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:31.000]   verse 9 and 10. Yes, I see you in the back. Thank you. Romans 10 9 and 10. Here's what
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.400]   it says, "If you confess in your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you believe in your
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:44.080]   heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." You will be saved.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.120]   So I want to start with a confession. I want you to repeat after me, "Dear Jesus,
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:50:00.960]   I believe that you have died for me. I believe, I have faith that your blood
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:11.640]   shed on the cross for my sins offers me new life in you."
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:22.400]   Jesus, would you help me to stop living for the world, to stop playing church, and
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:29.880]   to have a real intimate relationship with you?
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:38.240]   I make you Lord of my life. Thank you for what you've done for me.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.760]   In your name that I pray, you can take a seat.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:53.320]   Here's what I want to do. I want everyone that just stood, your next step into
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.880]   continuing to walk with Christ is to walk with His people. And I would ask you,
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.840]   come down front after the message and let someone know what you just did. Don't
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.000]   walk out of here being the only person who knew what you just did. Come down
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.320]   front, talk to one of our people and say, "Hey, here's what I just did. I just
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.640]   professed my faith to Jesus." And they're gonna tell you how you can now walk with
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:20.080]   Him and to become more like Him with your life. For all of us, my prayer, I'm
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.480]   gonna just pray right now, my prayer God, is that there's anyone here who didn't
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.720]   stand, if there's anyone here that's still living a life that has anything
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.720]   less than your best for us because they believe it's something that they can do,
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.760]   or they're still trying to earn your love and earn your salvation, would that
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.880]   break tonight? Would they step into the freedom that you and you alone offer, all
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.200]   for you, all for your glory, not on our own strength, but all for you, King Jesus.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.600]   In that I pray, amen.
