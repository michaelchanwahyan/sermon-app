1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,980
 Let me just start by telling you

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,340
 how the porch is set up a little bit.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,500
 And so we have about 250 volunteers

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,140
 that make this happen every week.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,740
 And so as we gather with those 250 volunteers,

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,260
 they're divided up on about five teams.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,100
 Those five teams have a male and female leader

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,340
 over each one of those teams.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,060
 And so those are our porch leaders,

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,140
 kind of the elders of the porch, if you will.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,620
 And so every year we get away with those porch leaders.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,540
 We go out of town, we go on a retreat,

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,860
 usually to a lake house.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,940
 A couple of years ago,

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,460
 we went to my in-laws lake house on Lake Whitney.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,220
 And so we went out there to Lake Whitney.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,460
 And what this looks like is,

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,260
 is usually a lot of praying, a lot of dreaming,

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,620
 asking God what he wants from the ministry,

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,520
 how we can best minister to you guys.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,620
 Those kinds of things.

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,260
 And at night we're usually sitting around a campfire.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,980
 And so we're sitting around a campfire,

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,660
 the guys and the girls, and we're talking.

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,980
 And there's this big field out there, okay,

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,060
 where my in-laws place is.

28
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,980
 There's this big field, some public land, if you will.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,700
 And I asked the leaders, I just said,

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,160
 "Hey, have any of you never been snipe hunting?"

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,860
 And about half of them raised their hand.

32
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,700
 They had never been.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,980
 And so let me just ask you guys,

34
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,340
 how many of you have never been,

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,600
 or you don't know what snipe hunting is?

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,160
 Would you just raise your hands real high?

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,960
 Okay, so that's a lot of you, okay?

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,800
 That's a lot of you.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
 So come back with me.

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,400
 If you have been snipe hunting, or you know what it is,

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,680
 would you raise your hands real high?

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,480
 Okay, so that's some of you too.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,380
 So a little more than half on that first one.

44
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,760
 And so this is kind of what was there.

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,320
 It was like half of us had been, half of us hadn't been.

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,880
 And I'm like, "Guys, we gotta go.

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,360
 "We gotta go snipe hunting."

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,340
 Like, it's gonna be so much fun.

49
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,040
 And everybody that's been, like, "Yes, it's so fun."

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
 You know, and so here's the thing.

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,600
 I know, don't tell them, I know, I know.

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,500
 And so here's the deal.

53
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,280
 We go out there, and I'm explaining to them.

54
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,880
 So a snipe, if you don't know what it is,

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,760
 it's like this little white bird,

56
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
 and it runs on the ground.

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,320
 It comes out at night, kind of like a,

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,480
 runs on the ground like a quail, if you will.

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,500
 And it comes out at night, and you can catch them.

60
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,160
 They're actually pretty easy to catch.

61
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
 And so the way that you do it is you get this headlamp,

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
 you know, 'cause the light,

63
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,920
 they're attracted to the light,

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
 and you get a little bag, like a burlap sack,

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
 and you have to be out there all by yourself in the field.

66
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,920
 It's the only way to catch them,

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,120
 and you have to call them.

68
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
 And so the call is irresistible to the snipe.

69
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,300
 And so my friend, Chantal, she's out there.

70
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,320
 She's like a legend with our porch leaders, you know.

71
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
 And I'm telling Chantal, I'm like,

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
 "This is how you catch a snipe."

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
 And she's out there in the field.

74
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
 So I teach her the call.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
 I'm gonna teach you guys the call so you can use it.

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,320
 And so you go, I mean, like, you go out there,

77
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,520
 and you go, "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!

78
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,000
 "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!"

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,760
 And you got this headlamp, and it's pitch black.

80
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
 And so she's out there, you know,

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,880
 and so we leave, and she's out there in the field.

82
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!"

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 She's holding the bag.

84
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,560
 "Come on, little snipe."

85
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,320
 And we kind of drive around the corner.

86
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,600
 Those of us who had been, we drive around the corner, right?

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,840
 And there's like this big shed there.

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 And we drive around the corner,

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,780
 and we're just watching and laughing.

90
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,400
 Because here's the deal, right?

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
 And this is what they don't want me to tell you.

92
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,240
 Snipe aren't real.

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,960
 (congregation laughing)

94
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,800
 There's no such thing.

95
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,760
 There's no such thing.

96
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,600
 And so I know, and, you know,

97
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,440
 and so it's funny, right,

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
 when you're looking for something that's not real.

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,680
 And it's even a little entertaining

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,520
 if the way that you're looking is foolish.

101
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,320
 And so many of you came in here this evening

102
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
 in search of love.

103
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,880
 Everyone wants love, and I have to break it to you

104
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,880
 just like I did for friends about this silly animal.

105
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,640
 The love that you're looking for, it's not real.

106
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,740
 It doesn't exist.

107
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,840
 You've defined it incorrectly.

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,080
 And furthermore, for so many of you,

109
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,840
 the way that you're looking is foolish.

110
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,120
 It's foolish.

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,560
 And I think the enemy is laughing at you,

112
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,240
 watching you hurt yourself and bring pain into your life,

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
 remaining single, having unsatisfied desires.

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
 He's watching you and he's laughing at you.

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,640
 And so I want to, from the scriptures tonight,

116
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
 show you that it's not real,

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,000
 that to find love, you have to,

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 to find love, you have to define it in the right way.

119
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,000
 See, actually, it turns out,

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,420
 I did a little Google search on the snipe hunt.

121
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,640
 It turns out there is a real bird called a snipe.

122
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,400
 And so this has been a long time, since the 1930s,

123
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,560
 this has been a prank that people pull.

124
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,120
 And so here's a picture of a snipe, right?

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
 It looks nothing like I described.

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,640
 It turns out it's nowhere near where we were looking.

127
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,800
 It lives near the beach and the sand on the shores there.

128
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,720
 And the way you catch it certainly isn't with a bag

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
 and a flashlight and a silly call.

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,600
 To find a snipe, you'd one, want to know what it looks like,

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
 and two, you'd want to know where it is,

132
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,480
 and then three, you'd want to know how to find it,

133
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,040
 or how to attract it, how to catch it.

134
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,680
 And so in the same way, we can make this so simple.

135
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
 You're searching for love.

136
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,800
 To find love, you have to know what it is,

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,280
 you have to know where you find it,

138
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,680
 and then you have to know how to look.

139
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,760
 Like if we can just solve those three mysteries,

140
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,000
 that's gonna send you out of this place

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,460
 with such a major upper hand than you came in here with.

142
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,800
 You're gonna be so much better off

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 if you know what it looks like and where to find it

144
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,840
 than when you came in here,

145
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,440
 or when you started listening this evening.

146
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,880
 And so we're talking about finding real love.

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,060
 We're in this series called Fantasy.

148
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,520
 The subtitle is Finding Real Love in a Fake World.

149
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,640
 And you might say, well, what do they mean by a fake world?

150
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,920
 A fake world is what has defined love for you

151
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,820
 before you came in here.

152
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,340
 It's social media, right?

153
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,060
 It's the highlight reel of everybody else's life.

154
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,180
 It's the airbrushed images in magazines, they're not real.

155
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,260
 It's the movies and the TV shows

156
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,640
 that are painting the picture of, hey, this is love,

157
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,080
 yet it doesn't last, it never lasts,

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,320
 and yet that's where you have gone

159
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,420
 to be educated on such topics.

160
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,240
 It's the dating profiles and getting catfished

161
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,560
 and tender out there, swiping right or left.

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 This is not going to lead you to biblical,

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,960
 sustaining, sacrificial love.

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,640
 It's going to lead you exactly where you've been before,

165
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,380
 like a dog to his vomit, hurt.

166
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,340
 Crying in the middle of the night, sad, going back to check.

167
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,860
 Has he texted me, has she texted?

168
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,100
 Wonder why, wonder what they're doing,

169
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,260
 wonder where they're at.

170
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,440
 Lost, confused, crying out.

171
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,500
 And I want something better for you.

172
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,140
 I believe your Father in heaven

173
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,100
 wants something better for you.

174
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,180
 And so I want you to look for something that's real.

175
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,780
 I want you to look in the right place.

176
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,800
 I don't want the way that you're looking to be silly,

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 like you're standing in a field making some silly sound

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
 with an enemy laughing at you.

179
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,900
 As we think about love, as you defined it

180
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,780
 when you came in here, let me just ask the question,

181
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,140
 is it even necessary?

182
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,200
 I'll read to you two statistics.

183
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,680
 These come from Aziz Ansari's book, Modern Romance.

184
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,580
 The first one just says,

185
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,860
 "Waiting for true love was a luxury

186
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,300
 "that many, especially women, could not afford.

187
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,900
 "In the early 1960s, a full 76% of women

188
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,560
 "admitted that they would be willing

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,140
 "to marry someone they didn't love."

190
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,420
 The vast majority of people said

191
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,700
 they would be willing to marry someone

192
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,620
 that they didn't feel romantic love towards.

193
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,240
 Crazy, crazy, right?

194
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,620
 And then it says, "Then the generation that came of age

195
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,700
 "during the '60s and '70s rejected companionate marriage

196
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,260
 "and began to pursue something greater.

197
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,520
 "They didn't merely want a spouse, they wanted a soulmate.

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,880
 "By the 1980s, 86% of American men

199
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,140
 "and 91% of American women said

200
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,540
 "they would not marry someone

201
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
 "without the presence of romantic love."

202
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,660
 So one generation, you have, say, the vast majority say,

203
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,820
 "No, romantic love's not necessary."

204
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,000
 And then in one generation later,

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,140
 you have the vast majority of Americans saying,

206
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,940
 "I wouldn't even consider marrying someone

207
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,980
 "without romantic love."

208
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,860
 My hunch is you are firmly in that second camp, right?

209
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,740
 What happened between the generation that existed

210
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,940
 in the '60s and the '70s and '80s?

211
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,500
 What happened in between there?

212
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,540
 Something called the sexual revolution.

213
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,340
 We thought we got so much smarter when it came to sex.

214
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,160
 You had the invention of birth control.

215
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,260
 You had the invention of Playboy magazine.

216
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,460
 You have, the very wave was created

217
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,700
 that we're still coasting on today.

218
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,260
 And we think we're better at it with all of our new,

219
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,880
 like we're like, "Of course I wouldn't get married in love."

220
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,180
 Let me ask you guys a question by raising my hand,

221
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,020
 by show of hands.

222
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,460
 How many campuses, you can participate as well,

223
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,460
 how many of your grandparents were divorced?

224
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,860
 Would you raise your hand if your grandparents were divorced?

225
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,260
 Now, not if they were widowed and they remarried,

226
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,900
 but if they actually got a divorce.

227
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,320
 Would you raise your hands? I wanna see them.

228
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,220
 Okay, okay, got it.

229
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,620
 How many of your parents are divorced?

230
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,360
 Wow, wow.

231
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,200
 Okay, can I tell you something too?

232
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,900
 You have twice as many grandparents as you do parents.

233
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,800
 So in theory, that first question

234
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
 should have been twice as many hands,

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,680
 but it was much less than half as many hands.

236
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,140
 Are we getting better at this?

237
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,480
 And you can answer this for yourself

238
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,060
 if what your grandparents had is true love or real love

239
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,320
 or more real love than what your parents have

240
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,160
 if you know them.

241
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,800
 And so I'm gonna be jumping around more topical

242
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,120
 this evening, but there's one verse

243
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
 I wanna look at up front.

244
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840
 It's Romans 12 verse nine.

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
 And it says, "Love must be sincere.

246
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,600
 "Hate what is evil, cling to what is good."

247
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,520
 Very simple verse.

248
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,340
 You can look at me.

249
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,320
 "Love must be sincere.

250
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,660
 "Hate what is evil, cling to what is good."

251
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,240
 To say that, like love must not be fantasy.

252
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,560
 Love must not be fake.

253
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 Love must be real and true and honest and authentic.

254
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,400
 Love, if it's real love, it has to be sincere.

255
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,840
 And I think the problem is we have not hated what is evil.

256
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,880
 We've clung to what is evil and we've hated what is good

257
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,080
 and we've settled for a fake love.

258
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,000
 We've settled for an insincere love.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,020
 And so as I move through this,

260
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,240
 we're gonna look at what is fake love,

261
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,480
 what is real love, and how to find it.

262
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,320
 And let's just start with what is fake love.

263
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,380
 What is fake love?

264
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,800
 So many people find fake love

265
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
 because you have no idea what you're looking for.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Right?

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,320
 You're just out there and you're trying to find something,

268
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,040
 but you don't know what it looks like.

269
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
 How can you find something that you don't know what it looks,

270
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
 and you hear this phrase, right?

271
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,760
 People try to help you with this phrase.

272
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,300
 Well, you just know when you know.

273
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,920
 Isn't that so helpful?

274
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,800
 You just know when you know.

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 Or you could know when you find what it is

276
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,140
 that you set out looking for.

277
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,360
 Wouldn't that be a better plan?

278
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,520
 See, like just this, it was yesterday actually,

279
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,760
 my friend texted me and was like,

280
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
 hey, I'm gonna go to the Allen Outlet Mall.

281
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,360
 Do you wanna go with me?

282
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,640
 I'm like, of course, I wanna go with you.

283
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,480
 And I like to shop.

284
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,120
 And so he picks me up and I'm like, what are you doing?

285
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
 He's like, well, you know, I'm looking for a rain jacket

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,920
 'cause it's been raining for like seven months here.

287
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,800
 And so he's like, I'm looking for a rain jacket.

288
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,880
 My rain jacket got a hole in it

289
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,240
 and so I was gonna go to the North Face Outlet.

290
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
 And I said, great, I'd love to go with you.

291
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,600
 And so it was interesting, our shopping experiences,

292
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,680
 because I wasn't really looking for anything,

293
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,640
 which is to say I was looking at everything,

294
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,120
 just kind of wandering around.

295
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,760
 I'm like, oh man, Zoomies, skateboard.

296
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,000
 I think I need a, oh no, and then over here,

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,720
 this coat, jacket, how about this shirt,

298
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
 these shoes though, right?

299
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,200
 And so I'm walking around looking all this,

300
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,820
 but his experience is so different.

301
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,400
 He's like, rain coat, okay, do they have this?

302
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,120
 And this side, okay, rain, okay, North Face,

303
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,680
 I'm gonna go check out Columbia.

304
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
 And then he goes to Columbia

305
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,200
 and just goes to the rain coat racks.

306
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
 Like he's on a mission, he's focused,

307
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,200
 he knows exactly what he's looking for.

308
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,080
 Meanwhile, I'm just running around,

309
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,200
 wandering around with a little bit of money in my pocket,

310
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,060
 thinking, hey, I don't know what I'm gonna take home.

311
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,120
 You know, and that's how some of you date.

312
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,800
 Right?

313
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,880
 Right, I don't know what I'm gonna take home.

314
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,060
 Who I'm gonna take home.

315
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,080
 Or who I'm gonna go home with.

316
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,720
 I know it's so simple, and I'm sorry,

317
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,580
 I know a lot of you missed it.

318
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,760
 What if right now you just said,

319
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,260
 hey, I'm gonna look for exactly this,

320
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,300
 and I'm not gonna settle until I find that?

321
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:16,500
 What if you left here with that reality, with that idea?

322
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,200
 See, we're getting married later.

323
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
 We're training for divorce, jumping into a relationship,

324
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,880
 jumping out, jumping in, jumping out.

325
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,440
 As soon as something goes wrong, jump out.

326
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,080
 That's not training for marriage.

327
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 We're not getting married at all.

328
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,640
 More than any other generation before us.

329
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,400
 And I think we have to ask the question, why?

330
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,500
 And so what is fake love?

331
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,600
 Fake love is defined by fake sources.

332
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
 Fake love is defined by fake sources.

333
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,620
 Fantasy begets fantasy.

334
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,800
 If your teacher is fake, then your results are fake.

335
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
 If what they've taught you is fake,

336
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
 then what you're looking for is fake.

337
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,600
 And so you have to ask the question,

338
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
 what defines love for you?

339
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,560
 Do you want what your parents have?

340
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
 Do you want what your grandparents have?

341
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,640
 Do you want what Kim and Kanye have?

342
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,240
 What is it that you're actually looking for?

343
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,000
 Who's defined that for you?

344
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,640
 Do you want what Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have?

345
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,760
 Or Ariana and Pete had?

346
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,260
 (congregation laughing)

347
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,180
 What are you looking for?

348
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,780
 And what's crazy is it's not even

349
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,500
 the celebrity relationships you're looking for,

350
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,780
 it's the relationships that they have on a show

351
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,060
 where they're playing a part,

352
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,020
 that's what you're looking for.

353
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,460
 I want what I saw on the notebook.

354
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,260
 I mean, really, that's confusing.

355
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,840
 (congregation laughing)

356
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,980
 I mean, which one, right?

357
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,560
 You really have been taught this by people

358
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,520
 who are playing a part from a script,

359
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,120
 acting for money, and you say, that's what I want.

360
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:15,080
 I want what the 27 failed bachelor or bachelorettes want.

361
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,620
 Really, that's confusing.

362
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,960
 That's what you want.

363
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,500
 That's confusing.

364
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,880
 What's defining your source of love

365
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,100
 that will help you know if it's fake?

366
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,180
 See, biblical love is sacrificial.

367
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,280
 It's not self-serving, right?

368
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,280
 It's not something that reality shows would be made of.

369
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,560
 See, you've been fed this lie of the man at Kais

370
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,360
 and the man at Klos, and in a really strange way,

371
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,740
 because we've met and we've talked, me and you,

372
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,440
 you want something that's incredibly broken.

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,900
 And you say, no, I don't want something that's broken,

374
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,800
 but in here, you're like, no, I kinda do.

375
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,340
 I kinda want him one minute to tell me he loves me

376
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,660
 and the next minute to tell me he hates me.

377
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,400
 I want him to bring me close and then throw things at me.

378
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,700
 No, I would never want that.

379
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,800
 Yes, you do, because that's what you've been entertained by.

380
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,220
 And in a really weird, twisted, broken way,

381
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,980
 somewhere inside of you, that's what you want.

382
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,060
 And I hate, the enemy's laughing at you

383
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,940
 in a field holding a bag with a flashlight

384
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,360
 making crazy sounds.

385
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,860
 He's laughing at you.

386
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,300
 And God wants something better for you than that.

387
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,660
 But they won't make any movies about it.

388
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,420
 Like when a man loves a woman

389
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,620
 and he gives himself for her,

390
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,420
 and a woman loves a man and she gives herself for him,

391
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,680
 you know what it is?

392
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
 Like, can I just be honest with you?

393
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,300
 You're gonna think I'm crazy on this.

394
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,440
 I'm gonna lose all credibility with you.

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,660
 Try to listen after I say this, okay?

396
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,680
 You're gonna have to try.

397
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,660
 It's boring.

398
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,160
 That's the truth.

399
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,360
 It's not entertaining.

400
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,460
 It's just, it's amazing, it's beautiful, it's sacrificial,

401
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,860
 it's incredible, it's godly.

402
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,980
 But honestly, you really, what you want,

403
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,200
 you want a boring marriage.

404
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,420
 A marriage that no director or producer's calling you

405
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,140
 saying, hey man, can we come over and film?

406
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,340
 Because that was, I heard you from three blocks away

407
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,380
 yelling at each other.

408
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,780
 No, no, you don't want that.

409
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,140
 You want, no, I didn't hear you,

410
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,220
 I've never heard you guys yell or even raise your tone

411
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,660
 or anything, it just seems like you guys love each other.

412
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,780
 That doesn't sell.

413
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,360
 Nobody came in here tonight thinking, man,

414
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,020
 I really want a boring marriage.

415
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,740
 But I hope you leave here wanting a boring marriage.

416
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,360
 Fake love is self-serving.

417
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,420
 See, fantasy is all about the pursuit of ecstasy,

418
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,560
 you know, the fantasy suite or fantasy island, right?

419
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,060
 That's fake love.

420
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,720
 If you're thinking about what they can do for you

421
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,520
 or what you can do to them, that's fake love.

422
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
 And so we think about sex all the time.

423
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,500
 This is a big felt need you came in here with.

424
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,180
 You want to have sex, you want to experience intimacy.

425
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,980
 And I get that, I've been there, okay?

426
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,980
 I have had all of the bad expectations that you guys have.

427
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,500
 Like I thought marriage, I was like,

428
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,960
 man, you just have sex all the time.

429
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,940
 Like that's what it is.

430
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,220
 I mean, I thought that.

431
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,780
 I'm like, she's gonna wear lingerie every single night.

432
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,460
 Just like I've seen in the Victoria's Secret magazines,

433
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,960
 you know, before I was a believer.

434
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,620
 Like that's what she's gonna do

435
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,840
 because that looks comfortable, right?

436
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,380
 I'm sure that's what she wants to do.

437
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,180
 And so, and then you get married.

438
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,020
 And can I tell you something?

439
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,800
 It's not like that.

440
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,580
 And I know, here's what you just thought

441
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
 'cause I heard it, it was so loud.

442
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,080
 That's just you, JP.

443
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,460
 Okay, can I tell you something?

444
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,460
 I spent the last 12 years meeting with hundreds of women

445
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,860
 and hundreds, maybe thousands of couples.

446
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,900
 I've seen the ones that are really successful.

447
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,060
 I've seen the ones that have failed.

448
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,320
 People will talk with a pastor about very intimate issues.

449
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,120
 It's the reality.

450
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,460
 It's not going to be what you think.

451
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,060
 Marriage is not one big hookup session.

452
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,040
 It just isn't.

453
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,540
 In fact, I'll come behind that with some data.

454
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,220
 My friend's a CPA and so he did a little research for me.

455
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,340
 And it's couples that have a lot of sex,

456
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,420
 couples that have a lot of sex,

457
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,420
 they have 3,240 minutes of sex a year.

458
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,580
 That's a lot, 3,240 minutes.

459
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,660
 That's a lot, right?

460
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,500
 Okay.

461
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,300
 I was gonna make a joke, but I'm not, okay?

462
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 The Holy Spirit interceded there and saved you all.

463
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,100
 (congregation laughing)

464
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,360
 Thank God for that.

465
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,420
 There are 526,600 minutes each year.

466
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,420
 That means that this couple who has 3,240 minutes of sex,

467
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,220
 they spend less than 1% of their time having sex.

468
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,180
 In fact, it's 0.62%.

469
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,220
 Here's what that means.

470
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,020
 Is a couple who has lots of sex

471
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 spends 99.38% of their time doing not sex.

472
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,380
 (congregation laughing)

473
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,260
 Everything else.

474
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,140
 Like I'm just gonna go with you for a minute.

475
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,900
 Maybe I shouldn't, but I think my wife and I

476
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,460
 are better than average.

477
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,660
 (congregation laughing)

478
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,860
 And I'm just shooting you straight.

479
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,540
 And here's the deal.

480
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,100
 We spend a lot of time, like okay,

481
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,700
 can you take him to that soccer game?

482
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,460
 No, I got this soccer practice over here.

483
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,300
 Okay, you go over there.

484
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
 No, I'm actually speaking over here.

485
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,900
 Okay, I'll see you Thursday.

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,420
 All right, maybe Thursday, okay.

487
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
 And then, and so you go here.

488
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,660
 Okay, grocery store, okay.

489
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,940
 And then dinner, is it, okay.

490
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,020
 No, I'm gonna eat, okay.

491
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,700
 I got the, oh, it's Tuesday.

492
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
 I have the porch, actually.

493
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,860
 I'll be there till about 10.30, okay?

494
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,300
 You see, that's real life.

495
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,260
 That's what it, and so if she was just great at intimacy,

496
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,140
 then that means she potentially would not be great

497
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,140
 at 99 point most of marriage.

498
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,700
 Make sure you're looking for what matters.

499
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,380
 And it's not sex.

500
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,860
 As my friend says wisely, you don't even wanna have sex.

501
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,420
 You wanna experience godly intimacy.

502
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,460
 And that's available for people who know

503
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,620
 what godly love is, and it's available exclusively for them

504
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,060
 and not anybody else.

505
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:08,260
 In fact, where the scripture talks about marriage,

506
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,660
 in 1 Peter 3, Colossians 3, or Ephesians 5,

507
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,780
 it tells you, hey, this is how to be married well.

508
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,140
 Nowhere does it say, and here's how you be a better lover,

509
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,020
 or here's some tips and tricks.

510
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,320
 It's all about, hey, you lay your life down as Christ did,

511
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,540
 sacrificial service, strive to live in an understanding way.

512
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,740
 These are from those verses.

513
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,180
 The verses that are about marriage,

514
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,540
 they don't say anything about improving your intimacy,

515
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,300
 but improving your service to one another.

516
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,740
 Even intimacy is not about receiving.

517
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,580
 It's not about you experiencing pleasure,

518
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,940
 but it's about serving in the scripture.

519
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,580
 And so fake love is rooted in how they make you feel.

520
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,380
 If you're going about thinking about

521
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,880
 how they make you feel, right?

522
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,180
 This is fake love.

523
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,820
 I do weddings every now and then,

524
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,060
 and every couple I marry, I ask this question,

525
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,100
 hey, why do you love him?

526
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,260
 Why do you love her?

527
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,300
 And there's this pattern in their response.

528
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,540
 Sometimes they'll say, well,

529
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,500
 I love the way he makes me feel.

530
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,700
 And I just call them out on that,

531
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,480
 'cause I'm like, man, that's incredibly selfish.

532
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,740
 What you love about him is about you.

533
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,740
 What you love about her is about you.

534
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,180
 Like, that's what you're chasing

535
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,520
 is how someone can make you feel.

536
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,160
 What about when they can't make you feel that way anymore?

537
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,280
 Right?

538
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,180
 Love is serving.

539
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,160
 It's giving.

540
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,360
 It's sharing.

541
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,020
 Man, and so what you love about them

542
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,120
 is how they make you feel.

543
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,620
 If we're chasing someone to make us feel a certain way,

544
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,020
 and this is, this is,

545
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,320
 so what so many of you came in here thinking,

546
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,260
 and it's not your fault.

547
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,100
 That's the truth.

548
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,140
 It's not your fault.

549
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,260
 You've been fed this lie, man.

550
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,320
 This is the lie that they're feeding you slowly

551
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,620
 and meticulously and strategically.

552
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,980
 The people who are really bad at love

553
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,340
 are coming alongside you saying,

554
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,580
 hey, let me coach you up.

555
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,900
 Let me teach you what love is.

556
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,980
 Love is like a drug.

557
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,300
 This is the popular message.

558
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
 In fact, let me just show you something crazy.

559
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
 We're coming out of our lyrics and lies series.

560
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,360
 And so just as a little overlap tonight,

561
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,160
 let me read to you some lyrics, which is always awkward.

562
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,220
 And so let me just,

563
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,580
 this is, these are the songs you're listening to, okay?

564
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,580
 The big idea, love is a drug you use, okay?

565
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,440
 And so Camila Cabello, she says this.

566
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,080
 Something must have gone wrong in my brain.

567
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,260
 Got your chemicals all in my veins.

568
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,640
 Feeling all the highs, feel all the pain.

569
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,480
 Let go of the wheel, it's borderline.

570
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,680
 Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight.

571
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,960
 Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me,

572
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,400
 just like nicotine.

573
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,180
 Rushing me, touching me.

574
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,680
 Suddenly I'm a fiend and you're all I need.

575
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,920
 You're to blame, just one hit of you,

576
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
 I knew I'll never be the same.

577
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,880
 Kesha just says it outright.

578
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,600
 Your love is my drug.

579
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,340
 It's the name of her song.

580
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,640
 Justin Timberlake's Push Your Love Girl says this.

581
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,240
 Tell me, can I get a light, roll you up,

582
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,920
 and let it run through my veins?

583
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,680
 'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you.

584
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,120
 I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you.

585
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,960
 Now you got me hopped up on that push your love,

586
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,920
 so high I'm on the ceiling, baby.

587
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,400
 We'll go Camila again with Machine Gun Kelly.

588
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,760
 She says, and we're both wild and the night's young

589
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,960
 and you're my drug.

590
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,440
 Breathe you in 'til my face is numb.

591
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,720
 Which reminds me of another one.

592
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,920
 I can't feel my face when I'm with you.

593
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,600
 And so The Weeknd, right?

594
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,840
 That's what the song is all about.

595
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,020
 You're a drug, I wanna use you.

596
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,000
 Even Fifth Harmony got in on this, man.

597
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,700
 Fifth Harmony, say it ain't so.

598
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,840
 I'm like that drug, drug, drug.

599
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,820
 He trip when he on it.

600
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,740
 One taste and he want it.

601
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,720
 This just in, okay?

602
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
 Public service announcement.

603
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,680
 Love is not a drug.

604
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,280
 You don't use it to get high.

605
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,520
 You don't use people.

606
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,720
 Dating is not a drug.

607
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,400
 And if you have bought into that lie,

608
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,160
 if you're chasing the next high, chasing the next feeling,

609
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,880
 it's also gonna come with the hurt and the hangover,

610
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,680
 the withdraw, if you will.

611
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,040
 When you begin to try to learn how to do it right,

612
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,280
 it's going to be painful 'cause all you know

613
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,980
 is what's wrong and you're hooked on it.

614
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,840
 You're addicted.

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,640
 What happens with drugs?

616
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,720
 What do we do with drugs?

617
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,520
 We use drugs, we get addicted to drugs,

618
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,900
 and we get hurt by drugs.

619
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,640
 And what happens with the way that you date?

620
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,080
 You use people, you get addicted to people,

621
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,300
 and then you get hurt by people.

622
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,440
 And I know that as you look in your rear view mirror,

623
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,040
 I just described a lot of your dating lives.

624
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,960
 And the enemy's laughing at you while you're in a field

625
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,400
 making silly noises with a bag and a flashlight.

626
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,080
 (congregation laughing)

627
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,660
 And your heavenly Father, He never, ever meant

628
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,920
 for you to experience the heartache and the pain

629
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
 that you've experienced.

630
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
 He didn't want that for you.

631
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
 And you're mad at Him.

632
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,680
 Why did He let me date Him?

633
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,400
 He didn't want you to.

634
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,700
 You didn't ask Him.

635
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,560
 You never asked Him.

636
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
 And then when you did, you did the things

637
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,680
 He asked you not to.

638
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,360
 And you're mad at Him.

639
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,920
 That's insanity.

640
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,660
 That's insanity.

641
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,920
 I'm not gonna listen to a word you said.

642
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,360
 I'm not gonna do it your way.

643
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,460
 I'm gonna do it my way.

644
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,420
 But when it goes south, you're to blame.

645
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,520
 Are you sure?

646
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,860
 (congregation laughing)

647
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:12,600
 Love is a verb.

648
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,720
 And so if you're looking for it,

649
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,220
 look for people who live out the verb, who serve.

650
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,080
 Someone who enjoys serving others.

651
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,360
 My wife and I were watching this movie on VidAngel.

652
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
 If you don't know what VidAngel is, find out.

653
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,880
 And so we're watching the breakup on VidAngel.

654
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,640
 And there's this scene, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.

655
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,720
 It's so intense.

656
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
 They're in this fight.

657
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,680
 So intense.

658
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,920
 And he's like, "You want me to do the dishes?"

659
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,280
 And she's like, "No, I want you to wanna do the dishes."

660
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,680
 And he's like, "Who wants to do the dishes?"

661
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,920
 And I would just say, people who love serving.

662
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,080
 People who love serving want to do the dishes.

663
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
 That's what you're looking for.

664
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,880
 Someone who loves serving others.

665
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,000
 And so what is real love?

666
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,960
 It's this.

667
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,800
 I'm gonna read it to you.

668
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,360
 This is real love.

669
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
 It's straight from the Bible.

670
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,320
 It's so clear.

671
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,720
 It's like God loves us so much.

672
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,840
 And so close your eyes as I read this to you.

673
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,660
 Let me just read it.

674
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,520
 You just picture it.

675
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,840
 You see it if you will.

676
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,640
 Love is patient.

677
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,020
 Love is kind.

678
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,840
 It does not envy.

679
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,940
 It does not boast.

680
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,280
 It is not proud.

681
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,080
 It does not dishonor others.

682
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,720
 It is not self-seeking.

683
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,880
 It is not easily angered.

684
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,840
 It keeps no record of wrongs.

685
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,400
 Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.

686
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,920
 It always protects, always trusts,

687
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,000
 always hopes, always perseveres.

688
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,680
 Love never fails.

689
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:06,260
 Real love is defined as sacrificial service.

690
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,720
 Real love is defined as sacrificial service.

691
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,520
 And so here's the simple assignment for you.

692
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,080
 You can compare what you're looking for to this list.

693
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,560
 This should be your list.

694
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,720
 I want her to be tall and brunette.

695
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,440
 No, no, this is your list.

696
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,760
 I hope he's a doctor.

697
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,720
 No, no, no, no, no.

698
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,160
 No, this is your list.

699
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,420
 It doesn't say doctor.

700
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,320
 It doesn't say that.

701
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,800
 She better be a virgin.

702
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,640
 No, no, no, this.

703
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,240
 This is your list.

704
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,160
 All that other stuff is silly.

705
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,120
 I want you to make sure you could just,

706
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,160
 so you're not tempted to email,

707
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,820
 I wanna be really clear, okay?

708
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,360
 All that other stuff is silly.

709
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
 Is that clear?

710
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,020
 Like are we clear?

711
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,860
 Am I clear?

712
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,680
 Am I being clear as I say?

713
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,560
 It's silly.

714
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,880
 It's silly.

715
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,240
 This is your list.

716
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,160
 This is what you're looking for.

717
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,120
 So how do you know when you found,

718
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
 it's not you just know when you know.

719
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,400
 You know when, it's this.

720
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,160
 Now I know, it's this.

721
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,080
 Are you saying I can just marry anybody that meets that?

722
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,040
 (congregation laughing)

723
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,920
 I am crazy.

724
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,200
 I know, crazy.

725
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
 Let's keep going.

726
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 Understanding first that you have been loved.

727
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:35,540
 You are loved right now, perfectly.

728
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,700
 I get so sad when I see my single friends,

729
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,280
 both male and female,

730
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,440
 when they don't find someone or their heart gets hurt,

731
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,640
 they turn from God.

732
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,920
 The one who has said he's never going to leave you

733
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,680
 or forsake you.

734
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
 And you're upset because you're alone.

735
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,080
 And what he wants you to realize is you're not alone.

736
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,960
 You'll never be alone.

737
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,320
 You've never been alone since you've known him.

738
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,580
 And you don't need to be mad at him.

739
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,640
 Okay?

740
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,320
 He's not the one that brought sin into the world.

741
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,200
 The world we live in is broken

742
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,640
 and there's heartbreak here.

743
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,400
 The world that you've been reserved for,

744
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,880
 the world that you were meant for,

745
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
 there's no heartbreak there.

746
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,640
 There's no breakups there.

747
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,160
 There's no divorce there.

748
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,120
 How many, and so many of you raised your hands

749
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,160
 and you, I hate that, I hate that.

750
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,060
 Like my heart hurts when I see that.

751
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,080
 'Cause I know that that didn't come easy, right?

752
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,460
 To live in that home, to see the things thrown about.

753
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,800
 Maybe it happened after you left

754
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,840
 and you got the phone call and it's like, what?

755
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,480
 But you guys promised.

756
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,560
 If you define love as giving of yourself

757
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,560
 for the good of others, then you can look for that.

758
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,200
 You can look for someone who is constantly giving

759
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,760
 of themselves for the good of others.

760
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,960
 John 15, 13 says this, "Greater love has no one than this,

761
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,600
 "to lay down one's life for one's friends."

762
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,120
 And this isn't just a Jesus juke, right?

763
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,640
 This is the reality that God has demonstrated love for us.

764
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,960
 He's the author of love.

765
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,200
 I'm gonna show you in a minute that love comes from him.

766
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
 He's the one that invented love.

767
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,560
 He gets to define love.

768
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,300
 If you're not looking for his love,

769
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,620
 then you're not looking for love.

770
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,440
 What you're looking for is not love if it's not God's love.

771
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,380
 Like God is the author of love.

772
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,000
 Not Hollywood, not the movies,

773
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,520
 not the songs you're listening to,

774
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,360
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

775
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,340
 And so he says, "Love is sincere.

776
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,280
 "Real love is sincere."

777
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,360
 It's Romans 12, nine, I gave it to you up top.

778
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,920
 "Real love is sincere.

779
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,540
 "Love must be sincere."

780
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,280
 And so guys, what this means

781
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,700
 is you can just be honest and truthful.

782
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,300
 And you don't have to like text message

783
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,500
 and hint around or play games

784
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,620
 or slide into DMs with something crazy.

785
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,780
 Like you can just be honest and speak from your heart.

786
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,800
 And this removes all the complications.

787
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,980
 Imagine if everyone left here and you were just honest

788
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,100
 and you didn't play games.

789
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,540
 Like what is games?

790
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,380
 What do I mean by that?

791
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,860
 You can receive a text message and you see it

792
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,740
 and you wanna text them back,

793
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,980
 but you don't because you want them to feel,

794
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,840
 what, that's love?

795
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,920
 I mean, really?

796
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,200
 That's what you think the creator wants from you?

797
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,960
 It is for someone to be sitting

798
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,160
 on the other end of the phone wondering?

799
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,200
 Like that's what you thought was going to get you

800
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,980
 a real solid marriage, one grounded in truth.

801
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,220
 Guys, are you serious?

802
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,240
 He has better for you than that.

803
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,400
 No need to play games.

804
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,400
 Like so many of us, we've learned to love selfishly.

805
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,880
 In fact, the only question we ask

806
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,640
 when considering an opportunity is what's in it for me?

807
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,400
 And to you, I would say serve,

808
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,080
 like get out there and give of yourself

809
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,280
 because in marriage, you have to do a lot of serving.

810
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,720
 If you don't enjoy doing the dishes,

811
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,560
 you're not going to enjoy marriage, okay?

812
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,440
 You're gonna be doing the dishes as often

813
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,600
 or maybe even more than you're going to be making love.

814
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,880
 Think about that for a minute.

815
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,060
 You better like doing the dishes.

816
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,000
 Right, my marriage friends are getting whiplash,

817
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,940
 nodding their heads so hard, I see you.

818
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,000
 And the enemy's so good, he makes me so mad,

819
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,920
 he makes me so angry because he keeps those of you

820
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,880
 that are selflessly serving single

821
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,640
 and he allows the people that are selfish

822
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,680
 and stuck on themselves and narcissistic

823
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,760
 and all concerned about the way they look

824
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,880
 and he allows them to get married.

825
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,720
 But can I tell you something?

826
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,400
 He allows them to get married five times,

827
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,200
 two times, three times, four times.

828
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,720
 And I promise, I've been doing this for a while.

829
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,680
 The one who's selflessly serving wins.

830
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,900
 They win every time.

831
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,680
 Winning looks different,

832
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,240
 but they're always better off than the selfish one.

833
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,540
 They're always better off.

834
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,280
 Let's don't play games.

835
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,960
 We'll make it complicated, keep it simple.

836
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,920
 If you like someone, tell them you like them.

837
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,820
 If you don't like them, tell them why.

838
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,640
 Be honest.

839
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,960
 Real love is not motivated by fear.

840
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,040
 Real love is not motivated by fear.

841
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,760
 Are you looking for love out of fear

842
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,360
 or are you not looking for love out of fear?

843
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,560
 Both are wrong.

844
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,440
 Real love is not motivated by fear.

845
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,560
 First John 4:18 says, "There is no fear in love,

846
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,120
 "but perfect love drives out fear,"

847
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,080
 because fear has to do with punishment.

848
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,040
 The one who fears is not made perfect in love, right?

849
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,800
 And so if you're here and you wanna be married

850
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,160
 because you're afraid to be alone,

851
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,640
 you don't have to be afraid to be alone.

852
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,200
 Like I said before, you've never been alone.

853
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,720
 And you need to know that your singleness

854
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,800
 is not a punishment.

855
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,120
 In fact, we did an entire message,

856
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,920
 messages on this reality that singleness is a gift.

857
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,080
 Please go listen to 'em,

858
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,520
 because after I finished that message,

859
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,400
 churches from around the country literally said,

860
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,280
 "Hey, can you come and give that message here

861
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,920
 "because we love our single people

862
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,140
 "and we want them to hear that."

863
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,040
 The scripture says that singleness is a gift.

864
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,140
 Please go back and listen to that message.

865
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,640
 And here's the truth.

866
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
 I gotta tell you the truth about marriage.

867
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,300
 And if you hear me and you believe me,

868
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,320
 if you don't believe me, that's fine.

869
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
 But prove it, you know what I'm saying?

870
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,040
 Like leave here and test it and wrestle with it

871
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,860
 and think about it.

872
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,040
 That's what I want to do tonight.

873
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
 I almost wanna leave you with questions.

874
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,960
 I want you to begin to question the things

875
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,120
 that you knew to be true when you came in here.

876
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,280
 Not the gospel, but the things about love

877
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,880
 and what the world has taught you about love.

878
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,120
 And here's the truth about marriage.

879
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,000
 I love marriage, it's a gift.

880
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,080
 Some of you need to hear that.

881
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,900
 Marriage is good.

882
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,200
 Those of you that are like afraid of it,

883
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,080
 I want you to know it's really, really good.

884
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,740
 Those of you that can't wait to get married,

885
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,420
 I want you to hear it's really, really, really hard.

886
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,800
 It's really good and it's really hard.

887
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,460
 Both are true.

888
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,620
 All right, here's the truth about marriage.

889
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,820
 It's much more practical than any of you

890
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,060
 want to believe it is.

891
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,040
 It's a partnership on life.

892
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,700
 It's like hey, life is hard.

893
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,220
 Like let's go through this together.

894
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,060
 It's not about all the feels.

895
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,940
 Like all the feels aren't gonna be there

896
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,160
 for a lot of the days that you're married.

897
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,440
 We heard in the '60s they weren't there

898
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,800
 for 76% of people who got married

899
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,560
 at a time when we even learned in this room

900
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
 that the divorce rate was lower.

901
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,920
 That should challenge your thinking.

902
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,900
 See, here's the reality.

903
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,800
 Once upon a time, like in the '50s and in the '60s,

904
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,660
 the beginning of the '60s, marriage was the foundation

905
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,380
 of your adult life.

906
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,580
 Here's what this meant is you graduated

907
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,180
 from high school or college and you looked out

908
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,920
 and usually you would marry someone

909
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,820
 within a five block radius of where you lived,

910
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,840
 which challenges the whole one mentality.

911
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,460
 Like the one was your neighbor, you know,

912
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,520
 right down the street.

913
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,480
 That was the one.

914
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,780
 And so you would get married

915
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:30,180
 and it was this reality of like man, life is really hard.

916
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,900
 Like I've gotta go to work now, I'm in debt, you know,

917
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,940
 I need help with these things.

918
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,060
 So let's come together and help each other.

919
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,460
 And it was the foundation and you would build the house

920
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,540
 on that foundation.

921
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,880
 This is how it used to be.

922
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,980
 Now you feel the pressure.

923
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,740
 When you came in here, you feel the pressure.

924
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,140
 You need to build the house.

925
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,320
 It needs to all be there.

926
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,420
 You need to have the job, make this much money.

927
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,060
 You gotta be able to afford a ring, you know,

928
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,700
 get out of debt, get everything all polished up.

929
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,000
 And then marriage is the furnishings.

930
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,620
 Once the house is built,

931
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,500
 I'm gonna put the furniture inside.

932
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,180
 You view marriage like the sofa that you buy

933
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,100
 after the couch is, sorry, after the house is built.

934
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,180
 It's not that.

935
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,580
 It was never meant to be that.

936
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,400
 What are we doing?

937
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,500
 We're waiting longer and longer and longer to get married.

938
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,340
 Some of us aren't getting married at all.

939
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,940
 Like if you want marriage,

940
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,400
 I believe God is a fan of young marriage.

941
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,060
 And if you wanna challenge me on that,

942
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,700
 I would just look at biology.

943
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,400
 When your body begins to prepare itself to procreate,

944
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,200
 and I believe that we obey the laws of the land.

945
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,420
 I believe that, you know,

946
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,780
 this is an area we've been heavily influenced by culture,

947
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,920
 but I will go on record and believe

948
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,920
 that God is a fan of young marriage based on his design.

949
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,500
 And it's not a capstone.

950
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,080
 It's the cornerstone.

951
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,960
 It's not the furnishings.

952
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,220
 It's the foundation.

953
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,840
 And so how do you find real love before we leave?

954
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,140
 How do you find real love?

955
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,120
 We do, Monica and I do premarital counseling,

956
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,460
 and we have the couples take this test

957
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,600
 called the Prepare and Enrich Test.

958
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,320
 And it asks them all these questions.

959
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,880
 And every, I believe this to be true.

960
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
 I think every couple that we've met with

961
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,600
 has missed one of the questions.

962
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,480
 Every one of them, I mean, they miss different questions,

963
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,440
 but every one of them has missed one question in particular

964
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,640
 that talks about love and how you define it.

965
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,480
 And it shows us as we look at the results,

966
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,920
 it says, hey, you need to help this couple

967
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,880
 with expectations.

968
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,720
 And that's what I believe.

969
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,400
 If I can help you with expectations tonight

970
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,680
 from the scriptures, if we can look at what love is

971
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,140
 from the one who invented it,

972
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,720
 then you're gonna leave here better off than you came in.

973
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,680
 That's gonna help you find what it is.

974
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,760
 And so if you know what it looks like and where to find it,

975
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,560
 you are set up for success, at least more success

976
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,920
 than you came in here with.

977
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,920
 If love is serving,

978
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,420
 then where you find it is among the servants.

979
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,820
 Like that's where you look for it.

980
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,280
 And here's what's ironic to me is,

981
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,040
 my friend told me about this term today

982
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,200
 called missionary goggles.

983
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,080
 Anybody heard of this, missionary goggles?

984
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,920
 I hadn't either.

985
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,680
 And I'm, that's, okay, so some of you.

986
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,640
 Like girls, I'll just talk to you for a second.

987
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,620
 Like you're so concerned with what you look like

988
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,800
 and the makeup and the hair and all of that

989
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,840
 and like just making sure everything's in order.

990
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,680
 And that's cool.

991
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,240
 Like God has made you that way.

992
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,820
 And I think that's fantastic.

993
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,560
 But I just, I wanna tell you an observation

994
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,720
 that my friend said today.

995
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,960
 And I was like, that's so true.

996
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,600
 Is what I see is, we go on these overseas trips,

997
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,480
 we go to a third world country.

998
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,600
 The girl doesn't leave,

999
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,640
 like she leaves her blow dryer behind, you know?

1000
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,880
 And I mean, we're lucky if she brought deodorant,

1001
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,160
 you know, hadn't taken a shower in three days.

1002
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,400
 And she's out there serving people

1003
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,160
 on the side of the Amazon River in the Amazon jungle,

1004
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,640
 caring for widows and orphans.

1005
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,320
 And some dude is across the way,

1006
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,960
 like man, I never noticed her before.

1007
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,300
 Like wow, she's hot.

1008
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,880
 Like literally, she's hot, like pit stains and all.

1009
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,720
 Like no.

1010
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,640
 [congregation laughing]

1011
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,060
 No, I mean, but it's like, and they come back

1012
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,000
 and the relationship takes off.

1013
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,840
 Like I've seen that.

1014
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,600
 Somebody's on launch retreats the same way.

1015
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,520
 I know it's not like serving like that,

1016
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,960
 but you get out there and people,

1017
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,460
 like the sparks don't fly

1018
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,940
 when you're all dolled up for the party.

1019
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,040
 It's like when you're all sweaty on the field, you know,

1020
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,000
 and everybody's nasty and it's just like,

1021
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,240
 but man, we're just running together

1022
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,400
 and we're having fun together

1023
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
 and we're experiencing the body of Christ

1024
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,440
 and fellowship together.

1025
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,480
 Like, just think about that.

1026
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,600
 Like, okay, I may be wrong,

1027
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,240
 but just think about it for a second.

1028
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,780
 And so you look among the saints,

1029
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,480
 you look among the servants.

1030
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,160
 Second Corinthians 6, 14 says,

1031
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,620
 "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers."

1032
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,860
 What does this mean, yoked together with unbelievers?

1033
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,260
 We were on vacation this past weekend

1034
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,340
 and we were in a museum, walking through a museum,

1035
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,020
 and I saw a literal yoke.

1036
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,420
 And so a yoke is something that you would use

1037
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,260
 to put oxen in, two oxen.

1038
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,220
 And so they would be yoked together

1039
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,620
 and they'd have to go the same direction at the same speed.

1040
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,460
 And so I took a picture,

1041
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,000
 here's my daughter and her friend.

1042
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,140
 Doesn't he look like just the average married guy?

1043
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,340
 And she looks like the average married girl.

1044
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,500
 (congregation laughing)

1045
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,760
 And I thought that was funny

1046
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,300
 'cause he's like, "Why are you taking a picture of me?"

1047
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,100
 And so this thing right here, this yoke,

1048
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,940
 that's what it's saying,

1049
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,260
 don't be yoked together with unbelievers

1050
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,580
 because if someone goes right,

1051
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,860
 like you're going to have to go right with them

1052
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,180
 or you're going to break your neck.

1053
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,580
 And in fact, you want to be yoked to someone

1054
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,680
 who's going the same direction at the same speed.

1055
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,660
 That's what you're looking for,

1056
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,100
 someone going the same direction at the same speed,

1057
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,260
 someone pursuing Christ at the same pace.

1058
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,380
 Like, and let me say this in case you're confused.

1059
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,720
 You should be recklessly,

1060
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,420
 you should be pursuing Christ with reckless abandon,

1061
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,380
 with everything you got, hard and fast,

1062
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,900
 and you should find someone who's pursuing Christ that,

1063
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,300
 "Hey guys, listen, 'cause I know this stuff is hard.

1064
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,360
 "I know Christian dating is complicated.

1065
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,780
 "I know we've complicated it with all these made up rules

1066
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,040
 "that aren't even in the Bible,

1067
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,160
 "and I just want to make it simple for you.

1068
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,200
 "What if, like just challenge me on this,

1069
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,540
 "what if it's just that simple?"

1070
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,600
 Like, what if you're just to leave here

1071
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,120
 and find someone who's pursuing Christ

1072
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,460
 as hard and fast as you are,

1073
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,860
 and you're to be pursuing Christ hard and fast?

1074
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,380
 What if, guys, what if the creator of the heavens

1075
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,700
 and the earth, like want you to leave here

1076
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,140
 and it just to be that easy?

1077
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,880
 Like not more complicated than that.

1078
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,300
 Now we can, you know, you're gonna leave here

1079
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,140
 and think about that and say,

1080
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,020
 "But what about chemistry and this and that?"

1081
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,900
 And I just say, "Let's just consider,

1082
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,620
 "I wonder what the success rate,

1083
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,420
 "like let's just say we took 100 people

1084
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,580
 "and they have wild chemistry.

1085
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,400
 "Like let's say we made up this show, just pretend.

1086
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,340
 "We took a guy and we took about how many girls?

1087
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,840
 "15, 17 girls, 12 girls, how many?

1088
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,160
 "25 girls, and we said,

1089
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
 "Hey, we want you just to go on dates.

1090
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,260
 "In fact, we're going to pay for some crazy dates,

1091
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,960
 "helicopter rides and whatnot.

1092
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,220
 "And we're gonna throw parties

1093
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,460
 "and we're gonna create chemistry."

1094
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,940
 And we saw, "Hey, how many of those at the end of,

1095
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,380
 "let's just say we did that like 27 times,

1096
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,780
 "hypothetically speaking."

1097
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,260
 And we saw how many of those were successful

1098
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,940
 versus over here, we just took a man and a woman

1099
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,640
 who loved God and we put them together and said,

1100
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,620
 "Hey, y'all be married."

1101
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,500
 But they both loved God.

1102
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,160
 You know that the divorce rate among a man and a woman

1103
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,960
 who are recklessly pursuing Christ, you know what it is?

1104
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,260
 Zero.

1105
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,020
 There's never been a divorce between a man and a woman

1106
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,260
 who are recklessly pursuing Christ.

1107
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,700
 It's never happened in the history of the world.

1108
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
 Divorce rate's zero.

1109
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:25,060
 And so girls, I know you're thinking,

1110
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,480
 "But it's not that easy."

1111
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,220
 I know you are.

1112
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,100
 I want you to know that God controls the hearts of kings

1113
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,220
 and of boys.

1114
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,740
 And you,

1115
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,780
 and you not getting asked out

1116
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,420
 may be his incredible mercy in your life.

1117
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,580
 Okay?

1118
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,100
 It may be his incredible grace.

1119
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,800
 And this is not a slam at the guys, but I see a lot of boys.

1120
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,100
 And so the Lord who loves you may be protecting you

1121
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,940
 from something.

1122
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:07,780
 And boys, men, men, I wanna help you.

1123
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,580
 If I can help you in any way, prepare yourself for that

1124
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,420
 'cause I've also see a lot of men.

1125
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,460
 And that's the truth.

1126
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:21,740
 And so men, find someone godly.

1127
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:27,620
 If you want marriage, find a godly woman and ask her out.

1128
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,180
 That's your assignment.

1129
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,060
 You can even say, "Hey, I was at the porch

1130
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,700
 "and he told me I had to do this."

1131
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,740
 (congregation laughing)

1132
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,540
 Find a godly woman and ask her out.

1133
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,460
 Okay?

1134
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,940
 The one that you're like, "Man, I wish, you know,

1135
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,020
 "my friend should date her."

1136
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,860
 Like that one.

1137
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:53,460
 And girls, when a godly guy asks you out, say yes.

1138
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,300
 'Cause can I tell you something?

1139
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,500
 'Cause he's scared, you need to know that.

1140
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,320
 You're like, I know you're like,

1141
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,620
 "Man, why don't godly guys ask girls out?"

1142
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,380
 Here's why, because they're scared.

1143
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,380
 Because you guys are terrifying, okay?

1144
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,500
 Because when we ask you that, it's truth, man.

1145
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,960
 You're terrifying.

1146
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,800
 You're terrifying.

1147
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,260
 In that moment, what we've done is we've taken

1148
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,220
 all of our strength and authority and any power that we have

1149
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,060
 and we just set it in your hand.

1150
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,340
 And we sit there vulnerable,

1151
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,420
 waiting for you to say yes or no.

1152
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,100
 And if you say no, you are rejecting us.

1153
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,080
 Like you say, this is what you're saying.

1154
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,500
 You look at us and you say, "You know what?

1155
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,220
 "I don't choose you."

1156
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,700
 And we go, "I know, it hurts."

1157
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,060
 And we go like this, you know?

1158
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,260
 And it feels like we can't recover from that.

1159
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,700
 And so you're like, "Man, I wish guys

1160
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,580
 "would ask more girls out."

1161
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,720
 Well, guys are like, "Man, I wish girls would say yes."

1162
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,200
 And so girls, if a godly guy asks you out, say yes.

1163
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,680
 And if you have to say no, say why.

1164
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,160
 The girls email me all the time.

1165
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,840
 I mean, truly, like, "Hey, what do I say

1166
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,040
 "if I'm not interested?"

1167
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,480
 Say you're not interested and say why.

1168
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,440
 But that feels mean.

1169
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,800
 Listen, we'll bounce back, okay?

1170
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,160
 We're gonna call our community group.

1171
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,680
 They'll rally around us, pray, you know?

1172
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,380
 (congregation laughing)

1173
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,600
 James 5, 16, the prayers of righteous

1174
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
 are powerful and effective.

1175
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,400
 We'll come back from that, okay?

1176
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,380
 The spirit of God will move.

1177
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,880
 But guys, ask a godly girl out.

1178
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,080
 Girls, if a godly guy asks you out, say yes.

1179
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,080
 And what if it's that simple?

1180
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,480
 And you say, "Well, what if I'm not attracted to them?

1181
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,200
 "What if attraction comes later?"

1182
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,000
 Like, I can't tell you how many marriages I've done.

1183
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,480
 I'm like, "Man, I was not into him, but man, today."

1184
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,120
 You know? (congregation laughing)

1185
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,520
 I hear it all the time.

1186
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,120
 And so men, be agents of God and ask out godly girls.

1187
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,700
 And girls, if you feel like, "Man, I just feel so helpless.

1188
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,160
 "I can't, there's like nothing."

1189
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,000
 You know what you can do?

1190
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,400
 There's one simple thing that you can do,

1191
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,000
 and you can do it every single day, is you can pray.

1192
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,560
 And some people will say, "Well, JP, you know,

1193
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,120
 "but there's that mess with my heart."

1194
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,400
 I'm like, "Man, I trust God in that."

1195
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,840
 Like, as you pray, God is gonna align your heart

1196
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,160
 with what he's doing.

1197
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,780
 But before you get angry at God,

1198
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,280
 like, make sure you prayed every single day

1199
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,280
 for the past three years, or ever long, right?

1200
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,840
 And if you haven't prayed,

1201
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,020
 like, I wouldn't waste any time being angry.

1202
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,320
 I'm just gonna end with a verse.

1203
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,120
 It's 1 John 4, seven.

1204
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,440
 It says, "Dear friends, let us love one another."

1205
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,520
 It really says in the Greek, it says, "Beloved,"

1206
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,240
 or loved ones, those who are loved,

1207
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,880
 "Let us love one another, for love comes from God.

1208
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,820
 "Everyone who loved has been born of God

1209
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,880
 "and knows God.

1210
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,180
 "Whoever does not love does not know God,

1211
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,000
 "because God is love.

1212
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
 "This is how God showed his love among us.

1213
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,420
 "He sent his one and only Son into the world

1214
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,580
 "that we might live through him."

1215
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:49,720
 And so, I want you to leave here.

1216
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,600
 And I want you to, it says, "Cling to what is good."

1217
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,400
 I want you to cling to the Father.

1218
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,200
 Love comes from the Father.

1219
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,500
 Those that know him, here's the reality.

1220
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,340
 No one who, someone who doesn't know God

1221
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,100
 cannot live out 1 Corinthians 13.

1222
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,940
 They can't.

1223
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,580
 What I'm saying, so I'm clear.

1224
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,760
 Your atheist friend cannot love

1225
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,300
 like God calls them to love.

1226
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,020
 It's impossible.

1227
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,420
 And someone who has been born of God,

1228
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,060
 they know God, they're walking with him,

1229
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,980
 they're pursuing him.

1230
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,140
 They can't not love that way.

1231
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,380
 That is how they love.

1232
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,660
 And that is why God, I believe God,

1233
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,980
 the scripture says, "Hey, this is all you need to know.

1234
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,660
 "You've made it so complicated.

1235
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,920
 "You've been listening to Kim and Kanye too long."

1236
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,760
 It's more simple than that, simpler than that.

1237
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,920
 It's this simple.

1238
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,000
 This is what you need to know.

1239
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,080
 And so, in summary, fake love is defined by fake sources,

1240
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,640
 is self-serving, and is rooted in how they make you feel.

1241
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,680
 Real love is defined by sacrificial service.

1242
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,960
 It is sincere, and it is not motivated by fear.

1243
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,920
 So find real love, knowing what it looks like,

1244
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,680
 and where to look.

1245
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:06,780
 We were at the fair this past weekend on Sunday.

1246
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,620
 We went out to the fair.

1247
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,800
 Anybody been to the fair?

1248
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,400
 Okay, wow.

1249
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,700
 Wow.

1250
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,420
 You're like, is it really that simple though?

1251
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,660
 Anybody been to the fair?

1252
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,500
 Yeah?

1253
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,600
 Okay, cool, good.

1254
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,780
 So you've been out to the fair.

1255
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,140
 So we were out at the fair,

1256
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,820
 and so I went with my kids.

1257
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,280
 Like, the fair is like the only place

1258
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,920
 where you pay a bunch of money to go in

1259
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,760
 and pay a bunch of money.

1260
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,400
 And so we went in there, and no, it's so true.

1261
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,880
 And the rides, they were doing the rides and whatnot.

1262
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,980
 And then I was like, "Hey, okay, let's go.

1263
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,320
 "We gotta go do something else."

1264
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,440
 My kids too, my kids were complaining,

1265
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,680
 "No, Dad, we still wanna do rides."

1266
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,120
 I'm like, "No, Daddy's broke, we can't."

1267
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,320
 And I'm like, "Let's go do something else."

1268
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,680
 And so two of them were really complaining.

1269
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,520
 I've got three kids, and so my oldest, she wasn't.

1270
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,340
 She was cool with that.

1271
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,420
 "Hey, guys, we can trust Daddy."

1272
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,360
 I'm like, "That's right."

1273
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,420
 And so we went, and so what I did then is I said,

1274
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,020
 "You know what, we're gonna come back and do one ride."

1275
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,900
 And I said, "And you get to decide what it is,

1276
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,400
 "but we're gonna go do other things."

1277
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,540
 And she was like, "Oh, Daddy, I wanna do that ride.

1278
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,020
 "It's like a roller coaster, but it goes in a circle.

1279
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,960
 "It kinda goes in a room and comes around.

1280
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,860
 "It's called the Love Bug.

1281
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,840
 "I don't know if you saw it,

1282
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,720
 "but they play that music in there,

1283
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,940
 "and it's just like this roller coaster.

1284
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,280
 "It goes up and down, but it's not really a roller coaster.

1285
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,600
 "It's these cars that are on a track,

1286
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,180
 "and it just goes around in a circle real fast."

1287
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,540
 And she's like, "I wanna do that one."

1288
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,700
 You know, and I was like, "Great."

1289
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,620
 And so then we went and saw the animals,

1290
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,740
 and we went to the car shows, but she just kept,

1291
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,000
 "I can't wait to do that ride.

1292
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,840
 "We're gonna do that ride.

1293
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,660
 "It's gonna be great."

1294
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,500
 And I was like, "Hey, listen,

1295
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,240
 "like enjoy where we're at right now.

1296
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,700
 "And we're going to do that,

1297
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,720
 "but like right now, let's enjoy where we're at.

1298
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,000
 "You know, look, look, that car,

1299
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,160
 "and look, there's a, you know, 600 bunnies,

1300
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,400
 "and there's a cow."

1301
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,900
 And I'm like, "Hey, enjoy where we're at."

1302
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,800
 And she's like, "But I can't wait to do that ride."

1303
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,140
 And so it became time before we were gonna leave,

1304
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,140
 we go back into the Midway, and we're gonna do that ride.

1305
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,900
 And so we get some more tickets, you know,

1306
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,740
 more to the house.

1307
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:56,680
 And, and, and, and we're, she's standing in line.

1308
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,920
 I'm just gonna send the kids on it.

1309
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,020
 And so Monica and I are watching,

1310
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,300
 and they get on to go onto this ride.

1311
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,200
 And you know, my son, my youngest, is the smallest,

1312
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,600
 and then my middle, and then the oldest.

1313
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,680
 And, and, and so what they did is they said,

1314
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,580
 "Well, the youngest needs to be on the inside,

1315
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,180
 "and you, because the ride, the centrifugal force, like."

1316
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,500
 And so they put the youngest on the inside,

1317
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,200
 and then the middle, and then my oldest,

1318
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,900
 the one that wanted to ride the ride, she's on the end.

1319
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,260
 And they start the ride, and it starts going around.

1320
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,660
 And at first, it's that look of pure joy,

1321
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,140
 like she's just having so much fun,

1322
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,700
 'cause it's not a scary ride.

1323
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,540
 And she's just having so much fun, and laughing.

1324
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,320
 It's like everything she thought it was going to be.

1325
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,540
 Well, then the guy's like, "Let's go faster."

1326
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,180
 And they, as they're going faster,

1327
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,980
 like her brother and her sister are coming toward her,

1328
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,260
 and I'm watching, 'cause I'm even filming on slow-mo,

1329
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,620
 you know, so I can Instagram it.

1330
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:49,500
 And, and, and I watch her face,

1331
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,180
 as her face changes from joy,

1332
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,060
 and she starts trying to push them off of her,

1333
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,420
 like, "Get off of me."

1334
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,780
 And then it kind of turns to like sadness,

1335
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,060
 and then it kind of turns to terror, you know?

1336
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,940
 And, and she starts in the middle of the ride,

1337
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,060
 she just starts weeping.

1338
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,040
 And I'm, it's hard to watch as a dad, right?

1339
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,860
 I'm like, "Oh my goodness, stop the ride, stop the ride."

1340
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,200
 And, and she just starts crying.

1341
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,500
 And I'm watching it.

1342
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,140
 And, and the ride comes to a stop,

1343
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,740
 and Monica and I are like, "Oh no," you know?

1344
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,460
 And she gets off, and she runs off, and she runs to me,

1345
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,580
 and she just buries her head in my stomach.

1346
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,460
 And she just holds me, and she says,

1347
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,160
 "Daddy, they were hurting me.

1348
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,180
 Daddy, they were hurting me.

1349
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:38,300
 They were hurting me, and it wouldn't stop."

1350
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,540
 And there's this thing that you're,

1351
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,380
 you're so looking forward to,

1352
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,820
 you're so excited about.

1353
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:55,060
 But if you've defined it incorrectly,

1354
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,860
 you're going to get on that roller coaster,

1355
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,500
 and it is going to hurt you,

1356
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,680
 like it has so many people.

1357
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,780
 And some of you, you've been in that roller,

1358
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,540
 on that roller coaster, you said, "I love you,

1359
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,940
 I love you too."

1360
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,740
 Long conversations, the text message is late at night,

1361
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,540
 "Goodnight, I love you."

1362
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,860
 And you've been hurt.

1363
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,380
 And some of you, you're on the ride right now,

1364
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,580
 and you need to get off.

1365
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:28,620
 And those of you that came in walking with a limp,

1366
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,020
 because you know you've been hurt, there's heartbreak,

1367
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,580
 you're losing hope in love.

1368
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,060
 You need to do what, exactly what my 12-year-old daughter

1369
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,620
 did, is you need to run to your father,

1370
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,620
 and embrace him, cling to what is good.

1371
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:50,100
 And he understands, he understands loss,

1372
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,940
 he lost his son for you.

1373
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,260
 And there is no greater love than that.

1374
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,460
 And love comes from him.

1375
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,900
 And he's never left you, nor forsaken you.

1376
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,300
 Forsaken you.

1377
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,340
 He's crazy about you, he is crazy about you.

1378
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,420
 And if you're wanting to know how to love,

1379
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,100
 you leave here, and you start with him.

1380
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,820
 We pray that you would.

1381
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,780
 Father, help us to know what love is.

1382
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:25,420
 Help us to cling to what is good, and hate what is evil.

1383
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,860
 And help us to leave here with a sincere love.

1384
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:33,060
 Thank you for the example that you've given us

1385
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,820
 in Jesus Christ.

1386
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,220
 For all that you've done for us in Jesus Christ.

1387
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,540
 Father, help us to live for you, through him.

1388
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,020
 Help us to be sincere with one another,

1389
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,620
 and kind, and honest.

 Father, would you take the things that we came in here with

1391
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,740
 that are not of you, and would you leave them,

1392
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,300
 help us to leave them behind.

1393
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,580
 And the things that are of you, God,

1394
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,420
 help us to cling to them, to know them,

1395
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,180
 to look for them, to search them.

1396
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,220
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1397
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,060
 Amen.
