 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,320
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:40,720
 What's going on, guys?

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,200
 [CHEERING]

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,320
 How are we doing?

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,840
 I love it.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,120
 I love it.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
 Hey, Dallas, good to be with you.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,200
 Fort Worth, tuning in.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,480
 Good to be with you guys.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,560
 People in Houston, there's a gathering starting in Houston.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,640
 Folks, tuning in from all over the world,

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
 we're so glad that you can be with us as we

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
 open God's word tonight and learn something.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,400
 His spirit makes known to us the things of Him.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,920
 And so I don't know when you became a Christian.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,240
 I know there's probably hundreds of you here tonight that

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,320
 have yet to become a Christian.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,000
 But when I had trusted in Christ after having been in church

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
 my entire life, when I was from a small town,

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
 and so when I moved to Dallas, I learned

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,080
 that I like shiny things, OK?

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,160
 Nice things.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,360
 And so what this looked like in my life, I loved nice cars,

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,640
 and I loved--

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,360
 my other strong affection is kind of a silly one,

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,920
 but I really liked nice watches or timepieces, if you will.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,160
 And so I was in the business world in corporate America,

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,880
 and my watch--

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,240
 my boss, rather, had this amazing watch.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
 And so I would always look at it with just covetous eyes.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
 I wanted that watch.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
 And so I liked watches, but this one particular watch

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,880
 held my deep, deep affections.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
 I'll show you this picture.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,120
 It's a Breitling Bentley.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,680
 And so it's made for Bentley Motors.

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
 And so the best of both worlds, right?

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,800
 Timepieces and cars combined, a very nice watch,

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,400
 a very nice car combined into one beautiful piece of jewelry

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,520
 that tells time.

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,560
 And so I wanted that watch badly.

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,600
 It's about $10,000, OK?

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 So this is before ministry, by the way.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
 Yeah, it cost-- well, some of you.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
 That hit home.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
 You're like, wow.

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,160
 Yeah, so $10,000, and I wanted it.

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,040
 And my love language is gifts.

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
 And so we're going to take up an offering.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
 No, I'm kidding.

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,960
 And so my best friend at the time--

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,720
 he's still my best friend-- goes on vacation.

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,560
 And he comes back.

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
 And so because my love language is gifts--

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
 I had showered him on birthdays and those sorts of things.

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
 It definitely was not his love language.

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
 It was not reciprocated well.

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,560
 And so he comes back from this vacation.

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,200
 And he says, hey, man, I got you something.

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,280
 And he kind of makes this formal to-do about it,

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,320
 you know, sits me down.

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,720
 And I'm like, finally, you know, finally.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,640
 And I'm sitting there.

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,680
 And he goes, yeah, you know, I know I've heard you say just

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
 some things that you like.

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
 And so he hands me this.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,600
 And I take it, and I open it up.

71
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,400
 And he hooked a brother up, man.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
 And I'm sitting there, and I'm like, I can't.

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,960
 Like, I can't-- what?

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,760
 And he says, yeah.

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
 He says, man, you've been a good buddy to me, good friend.

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,960
 You've been generous to me.

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,640
 And so I just want to give this to you.

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
 I know you love it.

79
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
 I know you love it.

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
 I thought about you when I saw it, and I got it for you.

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
 And I'm like, I don't know even if I can do that.

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
 I was a Christian at the time, a fairly new Christian.

83
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,120
 And I don't even know if that's like good stewardship.

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,200
 I don't think I can-- you know, I've

85
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,960
 got to give that to the poor or something.

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
 And so some homeless man in Dallas

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,320
 would be walking around with a Bentley, a Breitling.

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,640
 And he goes, he's just like, it's yours.

89
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,160
 And I'm like, but bro, I can't believe

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,280
 you spent that much on me.

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,160
 He's like, what are you talking about?

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,760
 He's like, I know what that watch costs.

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
 He's like, it's $50 in Chinatown.

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,320
 [LAUGHTER]

95
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:19,000
 He was like, oh, you thought it was real?

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,440
 [LAUGHTER]

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,200
 He's like, no, it's a replica, counterfeit, fake.

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 Now, I don't know if you saw it, but it's made--

99
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,920
 I mean, this is masterfully made to the exact weight.

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,440
 All of the exact markings, the exact emblems,

101
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,200
 everything on the outside looks exactly like the real thing.

102
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,120
 You can't even tell that it's not the real thing

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,440
 until you open it up and you look inside.

104
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
 But it's fake.

105
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,400
 That's what being fake means, is everything on the outside

106
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
 looks like it's legit.

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,920
 It looks like it's the real thing.

108
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,440
 But the inside is not the same.

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,160
 The inside's not Swiss parts, not 21 jewel movements.

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,040
 The inside's not Breitling made for Bentley.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,200
 No, the inside's cheap metal, cheap gears,

112
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,360
 pieces that will break down, pieces that won't last.

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,360
 And it's counterfeit.

114
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,520
 And so in the same way some of us have been in church

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,240
 and we say, hey, I have a faith.

116
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
 I know God.

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,880
 And we've learned this language.

118
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,000
 And we've learned some Bible verses.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And we've learned to study the Bible.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 We've learned to take pictures and to share.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
 What we're learning, and we've learned how to talk smart

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,240
 in circles so that others think that we're following God.

123
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
 But when we get all by ourselves,

124
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,840
 there's no relationship with God.

125
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,600
 Doesn't that define our faith, like who we are

126
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,400
 when we're by ourselves with God?

127
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,600
 Like when we're talking with him

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,720
 and there's actual relationship there.

129
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,440
 All that other stuff's done for men.

130
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
 That's fake Christianity.

131
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,360
 That's fake faith.

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,280
 So tonight I wanna talk about with you

133
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,920
 how to spot fake faith from counterfeit Christians.

134
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,200
 Because if you look at this, it's very, very difficult

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,080
 to tell that it's fake.

136
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,560
 You'd have to be trained in how to know that it's fake.

137
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,240
 How do you spot fake faith from counterfeit Christians?

138
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
 Now some of you, you're here and you're like,

139
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
 no, no, man, okay, well, the message is lost on me.

140
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,960
 I'm the real deal, I'm a Christian.

141
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,000
 I trusted in Christ.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,960
 It was really, I believed in him in my heart.

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
 I confessed with my mouth, believed in my heart.

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
 And you know, I'd say, but even you,

145
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,920
 there's elements of your faith, I promise,

146
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240
 that as we examine the scriptures

147
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
 of what Jesus is gonna tell us tonight in Matthew 6,

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
 there are parts of our faith

149
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,400
 that have drifted towards being fake,

150
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,480
 that have been for the approval of man.

151
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,720
 We've done to impress people,

152
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,160
 things we do to impress people.

153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,840
 That's the only reason anyone has anything that's fake.

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
 Why does someone buy a fake Breitling?

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,400
 Why does someone buy a fake Tory Burch?

156
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,360
 Why does someone buy something that's fake?

157
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
 It's to impress people,

158
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,800
 to look like they have the real thing when they don't.

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,200
 And why does someone have a fake faith?

160
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,440
 To impress Christians, to impress people.

161
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,560
 And so we're in Summer on the Mount,

162
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,680
 which is just a series we're doing

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
 on the most famous sermon of all time,

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.

165
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,920
 If you went home and read it, I said this,

166
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,440
 it would take you about 15 minutes

167
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,840
 to read through the Sermon on the Mount.

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
 But in that 15 minutes, Jesus covers law,

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
 missions, adultery, lust, love, hate, judgment,

170
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,960
 marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor, prayer,

171
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,760
 anxiety, money, materialism, heaven and hell

172
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,480
 in 15 minutes if you read it.

173
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,440
 And so we're taking it,

174
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,160
 we're chopping it up in these little excerpts.

175
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,640
 We're gonna be in chapter six, verses one through 18,

176
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,920
 if you want to turn there.

177
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,960
 Last week, David talked about loving your enemies.

178
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,440
 And consistently in Jesus's Sermon on the Mount,

179
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,120
 he goes after the hearts of men.

180
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,160
 He goes after the inside.

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
 Because the religious people of this time

182
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,580
 did so much for the appearance of holiness.

183
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,200
 They did so much to appear holy.

184
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,360
 And can I just tell you something

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
 that kind of concerns me up front?

186
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
 Is I don't know that they knew they were fake.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,060
 Like when somebody is a con

188
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,320
 and they live in that con for so long,

189
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,400
 I don't know that they actually know

190
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,640
 that they're conning people.

191
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,440
 Like I watched a movie just this weekend with my wife,

192
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
 Big Eyes, I don't know if you've seen it,

193
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,360
 it's about this guy who pretends to be an artist.

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,480
 And he lives in that for so long

195
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,220
 that he actually thinks he's an artist when he's not.

196
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,960
 And some of us, we've lived in Christianity for so long

197
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,760
 that we believe we're Christian,

198
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,840
 but when we get in our car by ourselves

199
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,520
 and no one else is looking, there's no relationship.

200
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,720
 And so the men of Jesus's day

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,740
 did so much to appear spiritual.

202
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,040
 Do we still do this?

203
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,520
 What's the number one reason people don't trust Christ?

204
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
 People aren't Christians.

205
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,840
 What's the biggest reason?

206
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,800
 Is it because they look at Jesus,

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,840
 they're like, "I didn't really like his teaching,

208
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,460
 "all this stuff about love your enemies,

209
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,300
 "that's just not my thing."

210
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,220
 I mean, is that what it is, they reject Jesus?

211
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,460
 They reject Jesus's teaching?

212
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,200
 Why do people reject Christianity?

213
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,300
 Because Christians are hypocrites.

214
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,800
 That's the number one reason I hear.

215
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
 You go to church, Christians are a bunch of hypocrites.

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
 They say one thing, they do another.

217
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,500
 They say, "Hey, this is how you should live,"

218
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,580
 but then they live however they want.

219
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,940
 They say, "Hey, the Bible is true,"

220
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,440
 but then they don't actually abide by it.

221
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,360
 They don't even read it.

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,840
 Christians are hypocrites.

223
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,720
 And so tonight, Jesus is going hard after hypocrites.

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,520
 Let's go.

225
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,340
 Verse one, "Be careful not to practice your righteousness

226
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,960
 "in front of others to be seen by them.

227
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,920
 "If you do, you will have no reward

228
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,040
 "from your Father in heaven."

229
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,080
 It's the summary of this entire message

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,200
 right there in verse one.

231
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
 Let me read it to you again, lean in.

232
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,500
 "Be careful not to practice your righteousness

233
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,740
 "in front of others to be seen by them.

234
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,000
 "If you do, you will have no reward

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
 "from your Father in heaven."

236
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,080
 So when you give, he's gonna give us three examples tonight,

237
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,140
 giving, praying, and fasting.

238
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,620
 We're gonna look at how fake faith gives,

239
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,400
 how fake faith prays, and how fake faith fasts.

240
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,440
 And he starts with the giving.

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,880
 "So when you give to the needy,

242
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,480
 "do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do

243
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
 "in the synagogues and on the streets

244
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
 "to be honored by others.

245
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,440
 "Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

246
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,820
 "But when you give to the needy,

247
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,300
 "do not let your left hand know

248
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
 "what your right hand is doing

249
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,480
 "so that your giving may be in secret.

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,960
 "Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret,"

251
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,920
 'cause he's God and he knows all things,

252
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,420
 "then he will reward you.

253
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,800
 "Do not give or be generous to impress men."

254
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
 Anybody ever been in a church where they pass the plate?

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,960
 You ever done that?

256
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,160
 Like, where does your mind go when they do that?

257
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
 I grew up in a church that passes the offering plate.

258
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
 Actually, I grew up in one where they come by

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,800
 with the baskets, which is even worse

260
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,120
 'cause he's standing right there, you know,

261
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,720
 he has the basket.

262
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,360
 And my mind always, like, I think it's human nature,

263
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,800
 I'm thinking, man, who's watching me right now, okay?

264
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,640
 It's all I got, dude, a dollar, what are you talking,

265
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,000
 you know, who's eyes on me?

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,640
 Now, can you imagine if we pass the plate,

267
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,300
 if you're a guest with us tonight, we don't do that.

268
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,560
 We don't take up an offering here.

269
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,040
 We believe that the Lord loves a cheerful giver,

270
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,960
 as the scriptures say, and so you can give in the back.

271
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
 We don't pass a plate here.

272
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,200
 But if you've ever been in that environment

273
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
 and you're sitting there, you can imagine,

274
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
 like, if I'm out there and there's a plate passing

275
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,920
 and I'm watching you kind of, you know,

276
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
 dig in your pockets and I'm like, hurry up.

277
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,280
 And so I go in my wallet, right,

278
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,000
 and I'm going to see what kind of money I have

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,960
 and I realize I don't have the dollar bill

280
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,400
 that I usually give in the offering.

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,360
 All I have is the 10, the 20, and 100,

282
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
 and I'm like, oh, I guess I don't give tonight,

283
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,800
 'cause all I, and then I'm like, you know what?

284
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,780
 I'm going for it.

285
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,920
 I'm gonna be extra generous this evening.

286
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,840
 I'm gonna give this $10 bill.

287
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,520
 That's gonna happen, and so I see it coming to me

288
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 and I'm just like, okay, you know, stop taking your time,

289
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,840
 let's get to me, and it gets me.

290
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,760
 The plate's right there, and I stand up.

291
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,400
 I stand up and I just grab this guy here.

292
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,000
 (congregation laughing)

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
 And I just.

294
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,820
 (horn blaring)

295
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,640
 Attention, please.

296
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,340
 May I have your attention, please?

297
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,680
 I love the way the Lord is moving in this establishment.

298
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,320
 (congregation laughing)

299
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,560
 And I see that you guys are asking for an offering,

300
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,840
 and I would like to generously give of myself

301
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
 the money that I saved on trumpet lessons.

302
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,640
 I would like to donate this here $10 bill

303
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,160
 for the cause of ministry in this establishment.

304
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,580
 You're welcome.

305
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,960
 Thank you, you're welcome.

306
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,600
 That's right, and feel free to name the building after me.

307
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,560
 Jesus, I love this.

308
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
 I love what he's doing here

309
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,760
 'cause this, Jesus is showing you his personality.

310
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,800
 He's using satire.

311
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,880
 He's using sarcasm.

312
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,120
 He says, hey, don't give like those who have the trumpets

313
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,680
 and they give to be noticed by men.

314
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,440
 I'm telling you, they've received their reward in full.

315
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,600
 Like, there's no history of people actually announcing

316
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,640
 what they give with trumpets.

317
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,820
 He's being funny.

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,720
 I love that.

319
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
 And so there's like a contradiction.

320
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,520
 Another reason people don't like the scriptures

321
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
 is they say, well, the Bible contradicts itself

322
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,980
 because in Matthew 5:16, it says in the same sermon,

323
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,680
 it says, in the same way, let your light shine before others

324
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,540
 that they may see your good deeds

325
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,880
 and glorify your Father in heaven.

326
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,740
 Is that a contradiction?

327
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,880
 Let your light shine before others?

328
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,600
 No, because you let your light shine before others

329
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,740
 for God's glory, but if you do it for your glory,

330
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,000
 it's disqualifying.

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,640
 You've received your reward in full.

332
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,540
 Now, if you give for God's glory

333
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,720
 or you do good deeds for God's glory

334
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,280
 or you're living to, for him alone, awesome.

335
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,600
 If you do it to impress anybody whose eyes are on you,

336
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,820
 it doesn't count.

337
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,120
 God doesn't receive it.

338
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,440
 So my first point this evening

339
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,360
 is fake faith gives to get noticed.

340
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,640
 Fake faith gives to get noticed.

341
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,260
 Giving lots for the wrong reasons

342
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,880
 is not giving, it's getting.

343
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
 If you give for the wrong reasons,

344
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,320
 you give to get noticed.

345
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,780
 That's not giving, that's getting.

346
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,700
 That's gaining something.

347
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,660
 You're not being generous.

348
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,460
 You're exchanging what you have for attention.

349
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,160
 That is not being generous.

350
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,780
 First Corinthians 13, verse three says,

351
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,580
 "If I give all I have to the poor

352
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,120
 "and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,

353
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,020
 "but do not have love, I gain nothing.

354
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,500
 "If I give everything for the wrong reasons,

355
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,040
 "I gain nothing."

356
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,900
 And so why you give matters more than what you give.

357
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,820
 Jesus is going out of his way to say

358
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,540
 if you give to impress people,

359
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,040
 there is no reward in that.

360
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,500
 Likewise, if you give because you are afraid

361
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,740
 of what it will look like if you don't give,

362
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,080
 you're giving out of the fear of man.

363
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,980
 And he says there's no reward in that.

364
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,700
 The church I grew up in, they had this,

365
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,820
 I don't know if you guys have ever seen this,

366
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
 it's like these baskets on a stick.

367
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,860
 And so when they would call for the offering,

368
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,220
 the offering men would come down the aisle

369
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,840
 and they'd gather, not offering men,

370
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,780
 I don't know what they were called,

371
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,020
 but there were these men that would take your money

372
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,460
 and they would come up here

373
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,020
 and then they'd spread out throughout the church

374
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,460
 and they'd walk down the aisles

375
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,540
 and they'd have this basket like this.

376
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,940
 And so before church this one day,

377
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,980
 one of the guys who was one of the offering men

378
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,140
 kind of got into this argument with another guy

379
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,060
 who was just attending church that morning.

380
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,340
 And so they kind of got into an argument

381
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,740
 and the guy that was just attending

382
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,380
 said something to him that wasn't very nice.

383
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,020
 And so when they go to the offering,

384
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 he takes this basket and he gets to that guy

385
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,420
 who was like in the third row

386
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,560
 and he just puts this basket in front of him

387
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
 and he just sits there.

388
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,020
 And the whole church is watching,

389
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
 and it's not a big church,

390
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,540
 but the whole church is watching

391
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,500
 and he just sits there and the guy's like.

392
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,460
 And he just starts shaking it a little bit.

393
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,780
 And he just, he looks at the basket and he goes.

394
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,900
 And the guy, I've never seen him,

395
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,380
 he just turned bright red,

396
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,420
 like blood just rushed to his head.

397
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,180
 He sat there and he eventually goes for his wallet

398
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,020
 and he pulled something out and he gave,

399
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,920
 but he did so for the approval of man.

400
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,500
 And in the same way, I think so many of us do that.

401
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,540
 Like whenever we do anything benevolent or philanthropic,

402
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,860
 we do so because we know people are watching us

403
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,020
 or we celebrate it via social media or whatever.

404
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,920
 Look at me.

405
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,220
 That's right, blowing my trumpet.

406
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,540
 Yes, I am that guy.

407
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,900
 Yes, I did.

408
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,820
 Yes.

409
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,020
 And he says, there's no reward for you.

410
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,600
 You've received it in full.

411
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,340
 Second Corinthians chapter nine, verse seven says,

412
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,580
 each of you should give what you have decided

413
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,980
 in your hearts to give,

414
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,740
 not reluctantly or under compulsion,

415
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,380
 for God loves a cheerful giver.

416
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,700
 That's why we don't pass a plate here.

417
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 I don't want you to be motivated by the person

418
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,620
 sitting next to you with their eyes on you.

419
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,260
 That's not a good reason to give.

420
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,540
 And so this is not saying

421
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,740
 that you can't have accountability around giving,

422
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,220
 it's saying don't give to impress people.

423
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,300
 And so what's that heart check?

424
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,060
 Have you ever guys helped somebody

425
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,540
 go on an international discipleship trip

426
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,420
 or you might call them a mission trip?

427
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,900
 And when you give online,

428
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,500
 there's always this box that you can check

429
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,140
 that says anonymous, but who wants to do that?

430
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,420
 I mean, if I give anonymously,

431
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,220
 I mean, they won't know that I gave to them.

432
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,460
 I mean, they won't say thank you or anything.

433
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,760
 Like that's not, how does that count if I give anonymously?

434
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,140
 You want a heart check?

435
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,260
 Give when no one's looking

436
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
 and give more than you're comfortable with.

437
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
 That will help you.

438
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,280
 That will help your heart.

439
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,480
 But it's not saying that you can't have accountability

440
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,940
 around this.

441
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,460
 It's saying the reason that you share

442
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,060
 should not be to impress people.

443
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,600
 I live in community,

444
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,320
 which means I just have this small group of guys

445
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
 we meet with weekly, couples actually.

446
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,000
 And they know all of my finances.

447
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I do not spend $100 without running it by those guys.

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,440
 If I'm gonna make a significant purchase,

449
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,600
 I run it by those men first

450
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,980
 just so they can help me check my heart

451
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,800
 so I'm not buying $10,000 watches.

452
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,980
 And we're going through our finances

453
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,060
 on this one particular year.

454
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,660
 And I'm talking to this, to my buddy,

455
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,960
 and I just see that $25,000 comes out of his account.

456
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,480
 Now to paint the picture,

457
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,000
 this guy makes much less than most of you.

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So he's just a normal guy, has a normal job.

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,080
 He's not a baller or anything.

460
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,920
 I mean, he's just like one of you guys.

461
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,580
 And I see this 25 grand come out of his account,

462
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,560
 and I'm like, "Hey, what is that?"

463
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,800
 And he's like, "Well, I don't know if I should tell you."

464
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,920
 And he references this.

465
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,520
 And I'm like, "No, I mean, tell us

466
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,220
 so we can celebrate appropriately."

467
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,740
 And he's like, "Well, we gave that."

468
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,560
 He's like, "We saved that to give."

469
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,040
 And I just said, "When?

470
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
 You know, when did you do that?"

471
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
 And he goes, "Well, I drove to the church

472
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,640
 all by myself.

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
 I walked down that quiet hallway."

474
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
 And he said, "It's deafening,

475
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,300
 the sound that a check makes

476
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,400
 when it hits the bottom of the offering,

477
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,440
 and no one's there to hear it,

478
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
 no one's there to see it.

479
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,440
 It's just you and God."

480
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,520
 He said, "We saved that to give."

481
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
 And you know what?

482
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
 I wasn't impressed by that.

483
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,320
 I was influenced by that.

484
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,560
 So we don't share to impress.

485
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,520
 We share to influence in the context of community.

486
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,360
 That's fine.

487
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,720
 But we don't share to impress people.

488
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,960
 We don't give to get noticed,

489
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
 or we don't give to impress.

490
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,600
 We give because we believe everything we have is God's.

491
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,800
 We have it on loan for his purposes.

492
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,880
 God, what I have is yours.

493
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
 It's not my money, it's yours.

494
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
 That savings account is yours.

495
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,240
 All that I have is yours.

496
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 The cattle on a thousand hills are yours.

497
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,760
 And so verse five,

498
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
 "And when you pray,"

499
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,520
 he's going prayer now,

500
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
 "do not be like the hypocrites,

501
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,320
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues

502
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,720
 and on the street corners to be seen by others.

503
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,040
 Truly I tell you,

504
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,840
 they have received their reward in full.

505
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
 But when you pray, go into your room,

506
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,640
 close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.

507
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,720
 Then your father, who sees what is done in secret,

508
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
 will reward you.

509
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,240
 And when you pray,

510
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
 do not keep on babbling like the pagans,

511
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,160
 for they think they will be heard

512
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,640
 because of their many words.

513
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,480
 Do not be like them,

514
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,400
 for your father knows what you need before you ask him."

515
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,440
 It's just interesting that Jesus is giving this sermon.

516
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,920
 He's like, "Hey, this is what's really important."

517
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,480
 And I don't know that we still heed these words today.

518
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,040
 He's like, "Hey, I want you to listen to me, guys.

519
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,600
 I only have so many words that I can give

520
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,920
 in the most famous sermon of all time.

521
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,840
 It's gonna be reserved for thousands of years

522
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
 so that people can read it and learn from it.

523
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
 And this is what I want you to know.

524
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,520
 Don't pray like the pagans

525
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,920
 who try to impress people with their many words."

526
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,800
 "This then is how you should pray.

527
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,600
 Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

528
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,160
 Your kingdom come, your will be done

529
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,760
 on earth as it is in heaven.

530
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,200
 Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts

531
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
 as we have forgiven our debtors.

532
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
 And lead us not into temptation,

533
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,480
 but deliver us from the evil one."

534
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,320
 And then he goes on, further heart surgery.

535
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,240
 "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,

536
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
 your heavenly father will also forgive you.

537
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
 But if you do not forgive others their sins,

538
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,160
 your father will not forgive your sins."

539
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,520
 Do you know what Jesus is doing here?

540
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,760
 Jesus is intentionally praying an unimpressive prayer.

541
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,120
 It's a very similar prayer to Luke 11

542
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,360
 when he grabs his disciples and he says,

543
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 "Hey, let me show you how to pray."

544
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,360
 Listen, not what to pray, but how to pray,

545
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,200
 which is different than what to pray.

546
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,360
 And he says, "Don't go on babbling the same things

547
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,600
 over and over like the pagans."

548
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
 What is that?

549
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,480
 And then what do we do?

550
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,000
 We take it, "Our father who art in heaven,

551
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
 hallowed be thy name.

552
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,000
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth

553
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
 as it is in heaven.

554
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,880
 Give us this day our daily bread.

555
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
 Hail Mary, full of grace.

556
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
 The Lord is with thee.

557
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,840
 Holy Spirit, glory be to the Father and to the Son

558
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,680
 and the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning,

559
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,000
 is now and ever.

560
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,040
 Angel of God, my guardian dear,

561
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
 to whom God's love and trust be here.

562
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,280
 Blessed is the Lord in these, I guess,

563
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,120
 which are about to receive,

564
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,160
 that I bow down to Christ, Lord, amen.

565
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,120
 Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest

566
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,880
 and let this food to us be blessed."

567
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,680
 God is great, God is good.

568
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,520
 What do we do?

569
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,320
 We babble these things and our hearts detest from our words.

570
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,480
 We're not thinking about what we're saying.

571
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,600
 Maybe you are.

572
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,440
 I didn't.

573
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,400
 Maybe you do.

574
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
 Maybe you say that, "Our father,"

575
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,680
 'cause you're my father.

576
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,600
 You're in heaven, I'm not in heaven.

577
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,440
 And maybe your heart's attached to the words, "Awesome."

578
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,240
 I'm not talking to you.

579
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,560
 But I think most of us, we go through this routine,

580
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,080
 the very thing Jesus is telling us not to do,

581
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,920
 and we pray the what, not the how.

582
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:18,400
 Bill Moyers was a former Baptist minister

583
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,760
 and special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson.

584
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,160
 And the president had invited Mr. Moyers over for dinner

585
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
 with his family there in the White House.

586
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,360
 And when he came in, President Lyndon B. Johnson said,

587
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,400
 "Would you say the prayer?

588
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
 Would you say grace before our meal?"

589
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,520
 And so when Bill Moyers began to pray before the meal,

590
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
 President Lyndon B. Johnson interrupted him and said,

591
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,080
 "Bill, Bill, speak up, I can't hear you."

592
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,080
 And he simply said, "Mr. President, I wasn't talking to you."

593
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,600
 And I love that because I think so often

594
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,120
 when we pray publicly,

595
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,400
 when we pray in the presence of others,

596
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,560
 and this is very true within the church as well,

597
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,320
 when we pray in the presence of others,

598
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,560
 we pray for them, not for their benefit,

599
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,860
 but to impress them.

600
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,840
 And so my second point this evening

601
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,640
 is fake faith performs prayers for people.

602
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,200
 Fake faith performs prayers for people.

603
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,960
 That's how you spot a fake faith,

604
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,480
 someone who performs prayers.

605
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,560
 Hey, I wanna pray, I want it to be special,

606
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,480
 I want they to hear me.

607
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,160
 And so if you're praying and thinking

608
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,700
 what others think about your prayer,

609
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,640
 you're not praying, you are performing.

610
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,600
 And likewise, if you're afraid to pray publicly,

611
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,720
 then you don't understand what prayer is.

612
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,400
 Because it has nothing to do with who else is there

613
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
 and who else is listening.

614
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,440
 Prayer is simply conversation with God, that's all it is.

615
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,760
 It doesn't matter who's listening,

616
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,640
 we're not thinking about who's listening,

617
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,920
 we're simply conversing with the creator of the universe.

618
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,400
 At my school, in high school,

619
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,440
 we had this deal called see you at the pole.

620
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,200
 Anybody have that?

621
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,040
 See you at the pole.

622
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
 You remember this day,

623
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
 like you were gonna gather around

624
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,120
 and pray around the flagpole,

625
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,840
 and so you get there and you're surprised who's there,

626
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,680
 you're like, really?

627
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,240
 You're like, you're a Christian?

628
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,920
 [congregation laughing]

629
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,760
 Man, I had no idea.

630
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
 And they're like, people are coming up to you,

631
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,520
 they're like, so you're a Christian?

632
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,600
 Yeah, man, I had no clue.

633
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,920
 Man, never knew that, wow.

634
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,600
 And you're sitting there and you grab hands,

635
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 and like the rule in my school

636
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,640
 is they would go around a circle in order,

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,560
 which is always a little nerve-wracking.

638
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,200
 'Cause I mean, you see it coming like a train,

639
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,360
 and if you didn't wanna pray,

640
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,960
 you simply squeeze the person's hands next to you.

641
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,000
 That's just a pass, I pass.

642
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,160
 Not today, you know?

643
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,760
 And so, you're sitting there,

644
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,840
 and so what I'm thinking about

645
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,040
 as everybody else is praying,

646
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
 is I'm noticing who's passing.

647
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,000
 I'm not a Christian at this point, but I'm a faker.

648
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,840
 And so, I'm seeing who's passing,

649
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,440
 I'm like, oh, yeah, scared to pray in public, huh?

650
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,320
 You know, and so it's coming closer,

651
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,360
 and I'm like, this is my time, I'm coming out.

652
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,000
 Like, this is gonna be big, you know?

653
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,240
 These people are gonna know how much I love God

654
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
 by what I'm about to say.

655
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,320
 I mean, this is gonna be amazing.

656
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
 People are gonna trust in Christ,

657
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
 'cause this prayer that's about to happen.

658
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,520
 And it's coming closer, and I'm thinking,

659
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,240
 okay, like, how do I start this, you know?

660
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,680
 Okay, Father, God, Daddy, Jehovah, Jireh.

661
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,560
 (congregation laughing)

662
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,040
 And it gets closer, and then they did a double skip on me.

663
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,880
 So, skip, skip, and I'm just out there now.

664
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,720
 I'm like, did she just squeeze my hand?

665
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
 It's my turn.

666
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 Two people passed, and now I'm,

667
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,800
 Heavenly Father, God in heaven,

668
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,960
 day by day, we pray by day.

669
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 Lord, protect our country, amen, squeeze.

670
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,240
 (congregation laughing)

671
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,920
 And I'm like, what just happened?

672
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,760
 I can't feel my legs.

673
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,520
 What did I say?

674
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,000
 What did I, afterwards, I'm talking about,

675
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,760
 hey, did you, so did you hear my, like, what did I say?

676
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
 (congregation laughing)

677
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,160
 Like, something about day by day,

678
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
 in the country, I don't know.

679
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,960
 Have you ever noticed how some people pray

680
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
 so different than they talk?

681
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,000
 It doesn't seem like they're conversing with God.

682
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,280
 It seems like, in those times,

683
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,120
 we're trying to impress someone.

684
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,760
 Father God, Father God, Almighty Lord,

685
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,640
 Father God, Father God, Jesus, Father.

686
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,520
 My uncle says we're the we just church.

687
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,080
 I said, what does that mean?

688
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,960
 He says, you know, you're the church that says we just,

689
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
 we just, and Lord, we just wanna ask you,

690
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
 and we just, and we just.

691
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,680
 (congregation laughing)

692
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
 Could you imagine, like, if my daughters

693
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,600
 talked to me that way?

694
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
 Like, I got two little girls, they came up,

695
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,120
 and they're like, Father, Daddy, we just wanna ask you.

696
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,920
 (congregation laughing)

697
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,000
 I'd be like, just ask me.

698
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Why are you telling me you just wanna ask me?

699
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,360
 We just wanna ask you, if in your grace and mercy,

700
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,480
 you might grant us dessert this evening,

701
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,960
 for thy mercy and thy benefit, and glory and honor.

702
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,600
 I would just be like, what?

703
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,080
 You want ice cream?

704
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
 I mean, just tell, like, what are you saying right now?

705
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,920
 Why do we do that?

706
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
 Can I tell you why we do that?

707
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
 We learn that.

708
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,680
 Fake Christianity's contagious.

709
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,440
 When it's been modeled for you,

710
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,360
 you take it and you run with it.

711
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,280
 Why do we go, Father God?

712
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,040
 'Cause you heard Father God, that's why.

713
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,000
 Father God, we just wanna, what?

714
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,120
 You heard somebody say that,

715
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,800
 and so you repeat it over and over.

716
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,520
 And the reason I bring that to your attention,

717
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,800
 'cause I'm guilty as well,

718
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,360
 is because we wanna make sure

719
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,480
 our heart's connected to what we're saying.

720
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,320
 And we're praying to God, not to anyone else,

721
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,400
 not to who is listening to us.

722
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
 We're not trying to press anyone with our prayers.

723
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,100
 We're talking to God.

724
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,480
 Your prayers are not performances, they're conversations.

725
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,160
 Now, granted, they're conversations with the Creator

726
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,300
 who could kill you as you sit there,

727
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,200
 but they're conversations.

728
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,280
 And so Jesus says, pray like this.

729
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,860
 Acknowledge he is holy.

730
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,620
 He says, pray like this.

731
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,860
 He has desires and so seek to know them.

732
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,760
 He knows your needs, ask that he meets those needs.

733
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,640
 And he forgives, and so should you.

734
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,500
 And he strengthens you in temptation,

735
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,080
 and so in temptation, rely on him.

736
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,120
 Amen.

737
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,600
 And then he continues the heart surgery,

738
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,680
 and he says, if you can't forgive others,

739
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,820
 you don't understand the gospel.

740
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820
 To which I'd encourage you

741
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,160
 to listen to David's talk last week.

742
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,540
 If you cannot forgive others,

743
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,440
 then you do not understand how the Father forgives you.

744
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,000
 And so bottom line, in prayer,

745
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,520
 don't perform to impress people.

746
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,720
 And so in the church, I really feel that temptation.

747
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,880
 I'm gonna end this message with a prayer,

748
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,000
 and all of you are gonna be listening.

749
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
 There will be thousands of people listening to that prayer,

750
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,160
 and so sometimes I start that prayer in my head,

751
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,320
 and I just say, Lord, there's a real temptation right now

752
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,440
 to wanna be liked.

753
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,480
 God, Galatians 1:10 says, am I now trying to win

754
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,840
 the approval of God or of men,

755
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,880
 for if I'm trying to please men,

756
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,960
 I'm not a bond servant of Jesus.

757
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,120
 And God, I just care too much

758
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,320
 what these people think about me.

759
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,600
 Would you heal my heart,

760
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,120
 and would you allow me to talk directly to you

761
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,160
 for our benefit and your glory, God?

762
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,000
 Help me.

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Help me not to perform with a bunch of words babbling

764
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,080
 that I've learned from fake Christians

765
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,960
 or fake Christianity, fake faith.

766
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,800
 Help me.

767
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
 Start your prayer with that.

768
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,440
 Verse 16, and when you fast,

769
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,960
 do not look somber as the hypocrites do,

770
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,320
 for they disfigure their faces

771
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,120
 to show others they are fasting.

772
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,880
 Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

773
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,840
 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face

774
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
 so that it will not be obvious to others

775
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
 that you are fasting,

776
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
 but only to your Father who is unseen,

777
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,080
 and your Father who sees what is done in secret

778
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,840
 will reward you.

779
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,720
 Praise God for the scriptures,

780
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,720
 'cause I know that so many of you came in here this evening

781
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
 fasting and just not knowing what to do,

782
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
 you know, messing your hair all up

783
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,840
 and letting everybody here know you're fasting.

784
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,240
 I know that's been a real popular conversation this evening.

785
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
 You've turned to your neighbors and said,

786
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,840
 "Yes, I am fasting, not even Whole30."

787
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,200
 Nope, I'm fasting.

788
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,800
 I'm going without, no, the problem is we don't fast.

789
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,840
 And Jesus, God on the earth, Christ,

790
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,480
 we're Christians, little Jesuses, followers of Christ,

791
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
 says when you do this, he just assumes the close.

792
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
 He assumes that we do this,

793
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,640
 and the problem is we don't do this.

794
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,680
 And I think it's one of the most powerful

795
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,720
 spiritual disciplines out there

796
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,920
 that we don't frankly take advantage of,

797
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,640
 that we don't benefit from.

798
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,600
 And so my third and final point is fake faith sacrifices

799
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,440
 or goes without to appear spiritual.

800
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
 Fake faith sacrifices to appear spiritual.

801
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,440
 And so Jesus assumes we do this.

802
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,280
 I don't know if you knew this,

803
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,280
 Jesus talks more about fasting than baptism.

804
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,880
 I mean, there's some of you here that believes

805
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,080
 baptism is contingent on salvation.

806
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,920
 It's not, by the way, okay?

807
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,360
 But some of you here actually think that it is,

808
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,600
 and I'm telling you, Jesus had more to say about fasting

809
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,880
 than he did baptism.

810
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,360
 He says, hey, this is really important

811
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,680
 that you would do this.

812
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,080
 And we don't do it.

813
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,040
 We don't go without.

814
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,360
 We don't wanna be uncomfortable in that way.

815
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,800
 It just seems weird.

816
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,640
 And I'll tell you that if we did fast,

817
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,320
 if we did go without, we'd wanna tell everyone.

818
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,000
 Like I don't skip dessert without telling someone.

819
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,400
 I'm like, do you see that willpower, man?

820
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,320
 No, sir, no dessert for me.

821
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,200
 I'm like, get the trumpet, man.

822
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,240
 That's right, not even a Whole30, just self-discipline.

823
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,740
 Relying on the Spirit, that's what just happened.

824
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,200
 Bill Bright, who founded Campus Crusades, now called Crew,

825
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,600
 he fasted every year of his life for 40 days,

826
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,600
 from 1994 until he passed away in 2013, I think.

827
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,840
 2013, no, 2003.

828
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,680
 2003.

829
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,480
 Of malnutrition.

830
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,080
 No, no, I'm sorry.

831
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,420
 (congregation laughing)

832
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,600
 Father, forgive me.

833
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,640
 Ah, no, he's a godly man.

834
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
 A truly lot of people know Christ

835
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,400
 because of the work of this man.

836
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,800
 And so he went from 1994 to 2003

837
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,440
 and fasted every year of his life for 40 days

838
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,320
 like Jesus did.

839
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,840
 Jesus fasted as an example.

840
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,140
 Why would Jesus fast?

841
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,120
 As an example to us, that we would fast.

842
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
 Showing him that, hey, he went through challenges too,

843
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,680
 as a human, fully human, fully God.

844
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,660
 He was hungry.

845
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,120
 And so, Bill, so what do I mean by fasting?

846
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,120
 All he drank for 40 days was water and juice.

847
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,560
 That's it.

848
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,720
 Like, could you imagine being in a business meeting

849
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,680
 35 days in?

850
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,760
 You hadn't eaten for 35 days and not telling anybody.

851
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,840
 I'd be like, guys, before we start this meeting,

852
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,200
 I just gotta tell you something.

853
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,240
 (congregation laughing)

854
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,440
 And I need a trophy.

855
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,480
 And dessert, you know?

856
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,080
 I was like, somebody needs to hear this, okay?

857
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,720
 I've gone 35 days without eating.

858
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,440
 Like, there would be, it would be Instagram,

859
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,320
 Twitter, like Facebook, everything would be going crazy.

860
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
 I'd be like, yes, I did, 35 days.

861
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,920
 I made it, 40 days.

862
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,560
 I'd want everyone to know, but he did it.

863
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,400
 When he did this, it wasn't public knowledge.

864
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,240
 He didn't tell anyone.

865
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,880
 He wrote a book about it now, telling us how to do it.

866
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,560
 But it wasn't something that he did to impress people,

867
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,040
 but to influence people.

868
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,240
 And many have been influenced by his life.

869
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,440
 And I love that fasting is not just a reminder

870
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,360
 to depend on God.

871
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 Some of you have probably heard that

872
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,400
 when you have hunger pains,

873
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,200
 then you can be reminded to go to God.

874
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,680
 Fasting is actually strengthening your resolve

875
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
 to overcome sin, why?

876
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,680
 Because it's going without what your body naturally desires.

877
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,320
 Your body naturally desires food.

878
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,560
 Everything inside of you naturally desires food.

879
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,600
 And so you resist that and you strengthen your resolve

880
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,840
 and your ability to resist that, just like sin.

881
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,240
 Your body naturally desires sex.

882
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,880
 Your body naturally desires attention from men.

883
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,560
 Your body naturally desires money or whatever that is.

884
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,440
 And so you strengthen your resolve to resist that temptation.

885
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
 That's what fasting is.

886
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,000
 And so fast, fast from things like social media.

887
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,720
 Okay, people come up to me all the time

888
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,160
 and ask about if something is a specific sin.

889
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,560
 They'll say, "Hey, is it a sin to drink alcohol?"

890
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,640
 And I'll say, "I don't know, fast from it and ask God."

891
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,760
 And then they'll be like, "Why don't you like,

892
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,400
 "go 40 days or six months without drinking

893
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,320
 "and ask God if it's a sin.

894
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,640
 "It may be a sin to you, I don't know."

895
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,920
 And they're like, "I don't wanna go six months

896
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,280
 "without drinking, well then it's probably a sin."

897
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,520
 (congregation laughing)

898
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,520
 I mean, the Bible says don't be enslaved by anything.

899
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,160
 Don't be in bondage to anything.

900
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
 So if people come up to me and say,

901
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,320
 "Well, is masturbation a sin?"

902
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,720
 I say, "Is it something that you participate in?"

903
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 Yes, okay, well fast from it and ask God if it's a sin.

904
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,400
 To be clear, show my cards on that,

905
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,560
 I don't think drinking is a sin,

906
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,720
 I think getting drunk is a sin,

907
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,360
 I do think masturbation is a sin.

908
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,120
 But wherever you're at, like, and I will tell you,

909
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,480
 anything that you can't stop, you're in bondage to.

910
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,560
 And so if you're wondering if something is a sin,

911
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,640
 fast from it.

912
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,320
 Take six months and say, "I'm gonna go without that."

913
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,880
 Or 40 days, start there,

914
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,160
 "I'm gonna go without that thing completely."

915
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,920
 And ask the Lord to reveal to you, fast from food.

916
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,720
 That's what Jesus is specifically calling us to,

917
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,320
 especially when making big decisions.

918
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,840
 I'm telling you, I believe it's the most powerful

919
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,400
 spiritual discipline that the Lord uses.

920
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,160
 Don't use it like superstition,

921
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,840
 but just say, "God, I'm gonna do this to draw near to you

922
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,400
 "so that I can hear your voice clearly."

923
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,960
 Father, would you speak into this specific decision?

924
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,240
 But do not fast to appear spiritual.

925
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,320
 Do not fast to impress people.

926
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,160
 This is just a line the Lord gave me

927
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,680
 as I prepared for this message, and so,

928
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,000
 it's this, I want you to write it down.

929
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,480
 We are so focused on our need for affirmation,

930
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,680
 we've lost the practice of adoration.

931
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,200
 We are so focused on our need for affirmation,

932
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,600
 we've lost the practice of adoration.

933
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
 It's no fun to do something super spiritual

934
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,520
 if no one's gonna notice, right?

935
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,160
 Like what credit, I mean, what?

936
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,400
 I don't get any credit from people?

937
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,240
 That's what he's saying, he says,

938
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,800
 "You live for God's approval, and God's approval alone,

939
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,400
 "which you receive through Jesus,

940
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
 "but when you receive it, then you live as though

941
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,160
 "you have a relationship with the Creator,

942
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,560
 "that you know Him, and you talk to Him,

943
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,760
 "and you walk in obedience to Him."

944
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,640
 You talk to Him, and you walk in obedience to Him.

945
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,800
 But some of us, we live like,

946
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,240
 well, if no one's gonna notice, like,

947
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,120
 why would I do that?

948
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,720
 That's no fun.

949
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,800
 I saw this video this week,

950
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,280
 and it's just too relevant not to show,

951
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,360
 and so, you guys watch this for a minute.

952
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,920
 Are you a Christian girl that loves

953
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,280
 taking photos of her devotions?

954
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,880
 Do you spend hours framing the perfect picture

955
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,860
 without the payoff of people noticing

956
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,280
 how spiritual you are on the internet?

957
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,920
 Introducing Christian Girl Instagram.

 101 tips and tricks to get more likes

959
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,480
 on your devotional photos.

960
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,120
 Hi, I'm John Crist with Christian Girl Instagram.

961
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,360
 Do you struggle to get likes

962
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
 on those devotional Instagram photos?

963
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,480
 Hashtag the struggle is real.

964
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,880
 From the best-selling author of shameless workout selfies

965
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,320
 comes Christian Girl Instagram.

966
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,560
 I would always get totes stressed out

967
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,880
 trying to decide which Bible verse to show.

968
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,920
 Not anymore.

969
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,440
 Okay, you're always gonna wanna stay away

970
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,960
 from common verses like Jeremiah 29 11,

971
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,280
 or John 3 16.

972
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,760
 No matter what verse you choose,

973
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,560
 you always wanna make sure you highlight multiple verses

974
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,200
 with multiple colors.

975
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,880
 Because after all, what's the point of having devotions

976
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,680
 if no one knows about it?

977
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,600
 I used to spend five minutes reading the Bible,

978
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,800
 and then like 30 minutes trying to figure out a hashtag.

979
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,120
 Then I found Christian Girl Instagram.

980
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,200
 My book includes over a thousand hashtag suggestions,

981
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,400
 like coffee with colossians, bliss, serenity, much needed,

982
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,920
 and of course, hashtag blessed.

983
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,840
 Thanks to inspiration from Christian Girl Instagram,

984
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,640
 I took down my Marilyn Monroe poster

985
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,080
 and replaced it with footprints in the sand.

986
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,640
 Christian Girl Instagram now includes bonus tips,

987
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
 like if you're gonna include your hand in the photo,

988
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,280
 always wear a purity ring.

989
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,400
 And remember, anything leather bound

990
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,960
 is really gonna pop with that Valencia Instagram filter.

991
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,160
 Christian Girl Instagram is great.

992
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,560
 My devotions are now constantly being interrupted

993
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,120
 by people liking my post.

994
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,760

995
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,240
 Buy now, and I'll also include my additional book,

 tips and tricks for effectively telling people you're fasting

998
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,640
 while ignoring all of Jesus' teachings

999
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,960
 about telling people you're fasting.

1000
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,480
 Christian Girl Instagram can be yours today.

1001
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,600
 This book and so much more available to you

1002

 all for the cost of less than a pair of yoga pants.

1003
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,760
 - I don't always do devotions,

1004
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,000
 but when I do, I Instagram it.

1005
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,200
 - So awkward.

1006
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,560
 (audience laughs)

1007
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,920
 It's funny 'cause it's true, we know it.

1008
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,320
 That's the laughter of conviction.

1009
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,160
 (audience laughs)

1010
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,880
 You guys, if you do spiritual things

1011
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
 for the approval of man,

1012
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,520
 if you do things to impress man more

1013
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,760
 than to relate or converse with God,

1014
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,840
 you need to question your salvation.

1015
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,880
 You need to ask yourself, is my faith real?

1016
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,400
 Do I really believe this thing

1017
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,760
 that I've always said that I believed,

1018
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
 or at some point I've begun to say that I believe,

1019
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,280
 or have I learned a way of living

1020
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,120
 that appears from the outside like I'm a Christ follower

1021
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,920
 when I'm by myself, I'm not following Christ?

1022
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,200
 I'm doing what I wanna do.

1023
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,640
 And so if you give for the approval of man,

1024
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,920
 if you give to impress people,

1025
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,680
 he says you have received your reward in full.

1026
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,480
 If you pray in a performance for people,

1027
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,720
 he says you have received your reward in full.

1028
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,560
 These are things that you should do so that God knows.

1029
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,720
 For your benefit of your relationship with God,

1030
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,120
 he says when you fast or when you make sacrifices

1031
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,040
 and you go through hardships,

1032
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,240
 and you do so to impress people,

1033
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,360
 to appear spiritually, he says,

1034
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,160
 appear spiritual, he says you're not spiritual at all.

1035
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
 This is what the scripture is saying,

1036
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,440
 this is convicting, especially in DFW.

1037
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:22,840
 He says your father sees everything you do.

1038
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,280
 Do it in relationship with him,

1039
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
 to have a relationship with him.

1040
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,720
 I want you to imagine for just a second,

1041
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,400
 use your imagination for this one.

1042
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,600
 If you worked in a warehouse

1043
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,480
 or on an assembly line in a warehouse,

1044
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,400
 and so you connected, you put widgets together,

1045
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,000
 all day, every day, there's this conveyor belt

1046
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,200
 in front of you and you're just putting widgets together,

1047
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,480
 that's what you're doing, right?

1048
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,880
 And your boss comes to you and he says,

1049
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,480
 hey, I'm going to be constantly inspecting your work.

1050
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,240
 And so he has this office that you go up these stairs

1051
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,560
 in this warehouse and there's his office up there,

1052
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
 it's like this box in the warehouse and it has no windows.

1053
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,760
 And so he'll go in there,

1054
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,040
 and you don't know what he's doing in there,

1055
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,520
 but every now and then he'll come out,

1056
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,200
 and when he comes out, the door makes a chime.

1057
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,040
 You guys following me?

1058
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,160
 So the boss comes out to inspect what you're doing,

1059
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
 he walks down those stairs,

1060
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,800
 and whenever you hear he's coming,

1061
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,840
 you're just like, game on, like you're doing your work,

1062
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,720
 you're doing it, right?

1063
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,160
 But then he goes back up those stairs

1064
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,760
 and he goes into his office,

1065
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,880
 and then you're like, hey, what's up, man,

1066
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,320
 how you doing this weekend?

1067
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,000
 I mean, no, nobody's watching, so let's catch up.

1068
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,920
 Man, how was the weekend, what'd you do?

1069
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,720
 Oh my goodness, oh yeah, tell me more about that,

1070
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,600
 let's talk about that.

1071
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,760
 And then you're just goofing off,

1072
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,000
 and then that door chimes,

1073
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,240
 and you know he's coming down those stairs,

1074
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,080
 and then it's like, okay, hey, game on, he's coming.

1075
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,440
 Boss man's coming, let's get after it.

1076
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,080
 And one day he says, hey, come into my office.

1077
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,280
 And you're excited 'cause you don't know what goes on there,

1078
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,240
 you go up those flights of stairs,

1079
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,000
 you go into his office, and you realize

1080
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,140
 the only thing in there is a chair and a TV,

1081
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,920
 and that TV is a feed, it's a camera feed

1082
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,880
 right over that conveyor belt,

1083
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,280
 he's watching you every second,

1084
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,080
 that's all he's been doing up there is watching you.

1085
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,760
 And it's the realization that he's seen everything,

1086
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,160
 he's seen the inside.

1087
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,440
 God has a camera into our hearts.

1088
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,720
 He's constantly watching the feed

1089
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,680
 and the activity of our hearts,

1090
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,680
 the longing of our hearts, the doings of our hearts.

1091
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,560
 And this is why Jesus has given this sermon,

1092
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,820
 he said, hey, the Lord knows what you do in secret,

1093
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,880
 and the Lord knows what you do for the approval of people.

1094
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,140
 Live for him, an audience of one.

1095
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:40,000
 So in closing, I'll tell you a story.

1096
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,400
 Right after Monica and I got married,

1097
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,800
 we'd been married, my wife and I'd been married

1098
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,700
 for about 10 years, brand new Christians,

1099
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,940
 we had just been in the faith about a year and a half

1100
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,280
 at this point, and we went on this trip to New York City,

1101
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,400
 and we did the whole New York City thing,

1102
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,240
 we did it up big, right, and so we go to Wall Street

1103
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,440
 and we see the Empire State Building

1104
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,720
 and the Statue of Liberty and Times Square

1105
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,000
 and all the things that you can see in New York City,

1106
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,160
 and she wanted a bag, a purse,

1107
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
 I guess I've been told to call it a bag.

1108
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,760
 She was gonna get a coach bag at the time, okay?

1109
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,640
 And so now it's Michael Kors or Tory Burch

1110
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,760
 or Louis Vuitton or whatever,

1111
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,480
 but then it was a coach bag

1112
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,680
 and she was gonna get it in Chinatown.

1113
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,360
 And so I don't know if you've ever done this,

1114
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,960
 I know I'm in a room full of devoted followers of Christ,

1115
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,780
 so you probably have no idea what I'm talking about,

1116
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,420
 but ladies, let me just inform you,

1117
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,220
 in Chinatown you can get fake purses, okay?

1118
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,080
 And so we would go there in New York City

1119
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,560
 and these guys stand on the side of the road

1120
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,980
 and they're like, "Coach, a Gucci product,

1121
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,280
 "coach, a Gucci product,"

1122
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,960
 and I'm like, "How much?"

1123
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,160
 And he's like, "Follow me."

1124
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,320
 And so we follow this guy, which is not safe,

1125
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,000
 and he takes us into this store,

1126
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,840
 and you walk into the store

1127
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,800
 and there's all these handbags,

1128
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,680
 these purses all over the wall,

1129
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,520
 but none of them are name brand,

1130
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,840
 and then he says, "Follow me,"

1131
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,320
 and he takes us into this back room.

1132
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,720
 I'm serious, okay?

1133
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,520
 The wall opens up, okay?

1134
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,720
 So there's all these bags hanging on the wall

1135
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,560
 and it opens up and it's like this magnetic lock on the door

1136
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,600
 and the wall opens up

1137
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,480
 and he takes us into this back closet

1138
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,080
 and he shuts the door, okay?

1139
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,880
 Keep in mind, a decade ago, new Christian,

1140
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,300
 and we're in this room

1141
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,360
 and there's all of these fake handbags on the wall.

1142
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,880
 And so my wife, she finds the coach purse she wants

1143
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
 and she gets it,

1144
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,440
 and he's showing me watches and whatnot,

1145
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,560
 and we leave with that bag.

1146
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,760
 And she's excited.

1147
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,600
 She got her purse, her coach purse, her fake coach purse,

1148
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,880
 and her friend has the real one,

1149
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,640
 and so when we get back to Dallas,

1150
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,480
 they're comparing,

1151
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,880
 "Oh, it looks just like,

1152
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,720
 "look, all the symbols are the same,

1153
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,020
 "the emblem is the same,

1154
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,480
 "look, the strap is the same,

1155
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,020
 "the leather's the same color,

1156
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,640
 "the stitching is the same."

1157
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,480
 I remember that conversation,

1158
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,920
 "The stitching is the same color."

1159
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,220
 You open it up, the inside looks the same.

1160
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,080
 It's like exactly the same.

1161
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,820
 I remember this conversation,

1162
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,280
 "It's like the same purse,

1163
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,100
 "but I only paid $20 for mine,

1164
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,920
 "and you paid 400 for yours,

1165
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,280
 "like, I win, you know, #winning."

1166
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
 And-- (congregation laughing)

1167
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,940
 And the problem is,

1168
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,500
 she began to wear that purse.

1169
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,880
 She began to use that purse,

1170
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,280
 she put stuff in that purse,

1171
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,080
 and she went through life with that purse,

1172
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,640
 and you know what happened to her purse,

1173
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,520
 her fake knockoff coach?

1174
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,800
 The stitching began to unravel.

1175
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,300
 The seams began to come undone,

1176
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,500
 the leather began to peel.

1177
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,740
 It didn't hold up.

1178
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,380
 When life threw things at it,

1179
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,060
 it just couldn't hold up.

1180
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,640
 And in the same way,

1181
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,860
 if you're here, and you have a fake faith,

1182
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,180
 can I just tell you something?

1183
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,260
 That what lies ahead of you are some real challenges.

1184
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,220
 Life is difficult.

1185
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,880
 There are lots of hardships out there.

1186
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,920
 I get to see, in vocational ministry,

1187
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,560
 up close, the hardships of individuals.

1188
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,220
 Lots of really difficult things lie in store

1189
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,640
 for each and every one of you,

1190
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,440
 and it's not anything you need to fret about,

1191
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,480
 or have anxiety about,

1192
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,660
 because God's got you.

1193
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,360
 And if you have faith, you have Him.

1194
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,460
 And it's enough to carry you through breakups,

1195
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,480
 it's enough to carry you through hardships,

1196
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
 it's enough to carry you through illness

1197
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,640
 and loss of loved ones,

1198
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,740
 it's enough to carry you through seasons of life

1199
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,280
 that seem unbearable, but a real faith holds up.

1200
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,440
 I will tell you that a fake faith

1201
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,580
 comes undone at the seams.

1202
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,100
 I'm not talking about momentary doubts.

1203
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,140
 I'm not talking about having to go back

1204
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,100
 into the Scriptures and be reminded of truth.

1205
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,680
 I'm talking about an unraveling

1206
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,220
 of a faith that was inauthentic,

1207
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,420
 it wasn't real.

1208
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,680
 God sees what you do in secret.

1209
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,340
 I am not trying to change your performance

1210
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,060
 or to make you better at it.

1211
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,660
 I'm trying to drive you back to that point

1212
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,660
 where Christ, who prayed to God and God alone,

1213
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,760
 who fasted for 40 days without the benefit

1214
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,180
 of any of you there to be impressed by it,

1215
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,620
 Christ who gave all that He could,

1216
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,860
 His entire life to set you free.

1217
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,180
 He said, "Because the things that you have done

1218
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,660
 "to impress people, I will pour out my blood for.

1219
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,180
 "It will cost me my heartbeat.

1220
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,680
 "It will cost me my breathing.

1221
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,500
 "It will cost me my life."

1222
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,240
 And He didn't die to impress anyone.

1223
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,760
 He died to reconcile you to the Father.

1224
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,340
 And that's where real faith starts.

1225
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,140
 So if you're here and you're like,

1226
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,380
 "Man, I know that I've got a fake faith.

1227
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,660
 "I know that I've been pretending.

1228
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,340
 "My faith is as fake as that brightling."

1229
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:56,900
 I would just encourage you to look at the cross

1230
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,760
 'cause no one likes to find out down the road

1231
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,300
 that what they have is fake

1232
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,800
 when they thought it was real.

1233
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,300
 And likewise, I don't want anyone here

1234
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,900
 to one day find out that the faith

1235
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,160
 that they said that they had was fake.

1236
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,300
 Let me pray.

1237
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,720
 (congregation murmuring)

1238
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,820
 Father,

1239
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,100
 you are in heaven

1240
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,380
 and we are on earth.

1241
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,420
 And so God, we ask that you would build your kingdom,

1242
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,740
 that you would bring it here

1243
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,700
 and that you would do that through us.

1244
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,100
 (congregation murmuring)

1245
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,840
 And Father, we pray that you would meet in this day

1246
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,460
 our needs as we leave here,

1247
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,200
 whatever it is we need to physically live,

1248
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,220
 whatever it is we need to survive,

1249
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,740
 that you would give that to us,

1250
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,240
 that you would grant it to us in your sovereignty.

1251
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,540
 And Father, when others sin against us

1252
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,820
 in the same way that we've sinned against you,

1253
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,720
 would we be as quick to forgive them

1254
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,740
 as you have been to forgive us?

1255
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,300
 And Lord, as we face temptation

1256
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:17,040
 in a relationship, at work, on a computer,

1257
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,060
 in the mall, out there in the porch cafe,

1258
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,860
 wherever we would go, when we face temptation,

1259
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,060
 God, would you please strengthen us

1260
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,180
 by the power of your spirit at work inside of us.

1261
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,800
 Deliver us from that evil, Lord, please.

1262
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,860
 Yours is the kingdom.

1263
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,260
 And yours is the power.

1264
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,140
 And you and yours alone

1265
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,540
 and only you and no one else

1266
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:55,540
 is the glory and the honor forever and ever.

1267
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,960
 (gentle music)

1268
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:08,960
