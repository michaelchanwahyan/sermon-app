1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:23,520
 - So awesome to worship with you guys.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 And I know Fort Worth, you just finished singing praises

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,920
 to God in Houston and wherever you're at,

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,500
 I pray that you would just start this message

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,660
 before we dive in, acknowledging God and His sovereignty,

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,220
 a creator of the heavens, the earth,

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,540
 and just that He's a good God

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,520
 and He's involved and active in our lives.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,700
 And it's fun to sing of His praises with you.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,820
 And it is a great honor to do so.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,280
 Great to be with you tonight.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,980
 If you would turn in your Bibles,

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,980
 if you brought them to 1 Samuel 17, 1 Samuel 17,

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,500
 we're talking about the man after God's own heart tonight,

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,460
 David, David was a shepherd, David was a king,

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,980
 shepherd turned king, and David fought Goliath

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,500
 here in chapter 17.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,980
 And so if we're going to talk about David and Goliath,

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,500
 what more appropriate than to start with a fighting story?

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,960
 And unfortunately, I have a few to choose from,

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,060
 but I'll start with the kind of first fight

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,740
 I had ever gotten in or been in.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,620
 And it started at Red Lobster, okay?

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,320
 This guy had been talking trash about me behind my back

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,260
 and I had caught word and me and my boys

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,940
 were at Red Lobster and he was there

28
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,900
 with his grandparents, right?

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,620
 And who's gonna fight in front of their grandparents?

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,660
 And so I walk up to him and I did what any coward would do.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,660
 And I pushed him against the walls

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,420
 like in front of his grandma, man.

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,060
 I mean, what is wrong with me?

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,140
 And don't let the pink shirt fool you, man, I'm thug.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,060
 And so I'm just like, hey, you got something to say?

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,380
 And he's just kind of like looking at his grandma

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,420
 and then he gets in the car.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,100
 I'm like, that's what I thought, you know?

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,300
 And that was that.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,620
 And so then he went to a different school than me.

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,140
 And so I'm at a basketball game at his school, okay?

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,380
 I'm on his turf, his territory.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,660
 And this is after the little Red Lobster skirmish.

44
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,100
 He, at halftime of this basketball game,

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,740
 he walks out to center court right there in the circle

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,700
 and he calls me out of the stands

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,140
 and he looks at me and he's like, you know,

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,180
 and I'm like, oh man, I think he's upset.

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,140
 And so after the game, you know, he comes up

50
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,740
 and he's got a few things to say

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,140
 and I'm like, okay, it's gonna go down, you know?

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,940
 And that's cool because I had taken Taekwondo.

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,380
 I was like at least a yellow belt and stuff.

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,420
 And so it was like the scene in a movie.

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,220
 It was nighttime, we go in the back,

56
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,300
 we're on the blacktop, the asphalt,

57
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,180
 and there's hundreds of people around

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,340
 from his school, of course,

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
 and so they're chanting his name, I'm like, okay.

60
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,980
 And I'm thinking like, just truth be told,

61
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,180
 I'm thinking, I'm gonna kill this kid, okay?

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,260
 'Cause he's a little guy, he was short,

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,900
 I'm six foot seven, you know,

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,060
 I was this height in high school,

65
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,100
 and I'm like, I'm gonna kill this kid.

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,340
 I'm like, where are you at, you know?

67
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,900
 About to Daniel LaRusso this guy.

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,260
 And so anyways, he, you know, the crowds part

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,220
 and he comes forward and I'm just like, I'm ready, you know?

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,260
 And he kind of feints back like he's gonna punch me

71
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,780
 and then he goes to wraps me up

72
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,820
 and I'm just cocky, I'm just like,

73
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,580
 I had slipped off my Doc Martin sandals,

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,140
 I'm ready to do work.

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,540
 And I just remember saying this in his ear,

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,300
 I'm like, dude, you're not gonna slam me, you know?

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,260
 And then right about then he slammed me.

78
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,260
 And he just started, boom, unloading on my face.

79
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,620
 And it dawned on me, oh, we're really gonna fight.

80
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,180
 Up until now, I was like, we just wrestle, you know,

81
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
 it was all fun and games.

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,500
 I didn't know this was really gonna go down like this.

83
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,180
 And so I'm staring at the street light,

84
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,500
 the street light's like flashing like a camera flash

85
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,660
 every time I get punched by his fist.

86
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,780
 And it was terrible.

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,780
 It was like, I got slaughtered by this dude.

88
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,100
 Like just completely annihilated.

89
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,620
 I was so humbled by this guy.

90
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,020
 It was the worst, it was such a terrible day.

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,120
 And you know, and it just not how I thought

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,680
 it was gonna go, you know?

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,300
 I thought it was gonna go different than that.

94
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,820
 And as I think about that experience,

95
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,100
 I had trusted in all the wrong things.

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,400
 Like I had trusted in my strength,

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,820
 I had trusted in my stature, my size, my height.

98
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,820
 And I had placed my faith in the wrong things

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,080
 and it failed me.

100
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,780
 And anytime you place your faith in you,

101
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,160
 it's not going to go well, well for you.

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,160
 And I'm not saying that if I would have only,

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,640
 you know, stepped up to the, you know,

104
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,960
 the ring trusting in God, that would have went a lot better.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
 No, had I trusted in God,

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,420
 I would have never been in that situation.

107
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,120
 Had I placed my faith in God,

108
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,760
 I wouldn't have been in the situation to begin with.

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,680
 But because I had placed my faith in myself

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,920
 and it manifested in this gross arrogance,

111
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,360
 it didn't go well for me.

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,760
 In fact, it humbled me.

113
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,900
 And as I think about Christianity today,

114
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,000
 I think so many of us walk around

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,120
 throwing around this word faith,

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,380
 like we have it in God

117
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,240
 and really we just have it in ourselves.

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
 Like God, we trust you and really we trust our jobs,

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
 we trust our money, we trust our savings,

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
 we trust our relationships,

121
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
 we trust our strengths and our abilities.

122
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,520
 And really what we pray for are things

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,380
 that would allow us not to trust you.

124
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,320
 God, give me comforts.

125
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,180
 Give me the easy life.

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,360
 Give me everything I want

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,480
 so that I wouldn't need to trust you,

128
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,840
 I wouldn't need faith in you, God.

129
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,280
 So trusting in yourself has two outcomes

130
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
 that I wanna talk with you about this evening.

131
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,680
 One is fear and the other is false confidence.

132
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,500
 When you trust in yourself,

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,720
 you are left with fear or false confidence.

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
 Let me just illustrate this for a second

135
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
 and ladies, I'll rope you in

136
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
 to the old fighting illustration, if you will.

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,780
 And so if you trust in your looks,

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,760
 if you feel like you're the prettiest girl,

139
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,180
 you're gonna have a false confidence.

140
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,500
 You've trusted in what is fleeting,

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,240
 you've trusted in something that's going to go away.

142
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,980
 But when a prettier girl comes,

143
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,020
 then all of a sudden you become fearful,

144
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,640
 you feel threatened.

145
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,300
 Okay, so it either leads to a false arrogance

146
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,300
 or a false confidence or it leads to fear

147
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,820
 because you've put your faith in the wrong thing.

148
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,420
 And this is what I think marks American Christianity,

149
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,140
 us placing our faith in the wrong thing.

150
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,260
 And so tonight we're talking about the results of faith.

151
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,820
 We're gonna look at the faith of Goliath,

152
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,180
 the faith of the Israelites

153
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,220
 and the faith of the man after God's own heart, David.

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,820
 To define faith, it's defined this way,

155
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,480
 complete trust or confidence in someone or something.

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,500
 Complete trust or confidence in someone or something.

157
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,540
 When you have that complete trust

158
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
 in the things of this world,

159
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,900
 if you've built it on fleeting things,

160
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,380
 it falls out from underneath you like a trap door.

161
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,940
 Sooner or later it leaves you devastated,

162
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,360
 disappointed, discouraged, wanting.

163
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,700
 But if you placed your faith in something constant,

164
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,760
 it never fails you.

165
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,940
 It's always there for you.

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,020
 If we can learn this this evening,

167
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,100
 this is a life changer,

168
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,400
 it's a game changer for the way that you live.

169
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,160
 And I think this story really teaches it.

170
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,260
 And so I'm gonna give you two examples of misplaced faith

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,160
 and one of a correctly placed faith

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,200
 before you leave here this evening.

173
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,660
 And so David and Goliath is a historical account.

174
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,800
 It happened about 1024 BC,

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,760
 so about a thousand years before Christ shows up on the scene

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,940
 it happened in a real place, the Valley of Elah.

177
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,820
 I was just there, I drove right by this little area

178
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,360
 just south of Jerusalem where this fight went down.

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,160
 Two hills, valley in between,

180
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,940
 that's where they're at right now.

181
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
 David, a lot of times the storybooks

182
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,480
 kind of picture him as a little boy.

183
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,740
 He wasn't a boy, he was 18, not 20,

184
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,920
 not old enough to fight in Saul's army yet, but a man.

185
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,760
 So he was probably 18 or 19 years old, David, in this story.

186
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,280
 He's the son of Jesse and we know he has brothers.

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,240
 This is the real true Cinderella story.

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
 People love this story.

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,440
 The History Channel continues to retell stories

190
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,560
 about David and Goliath.

191
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,020
 They talk about how his sling

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,240
 could have actually killed this man.

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
 They've tested it.

194
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,640
 They brought in an expert, a sling expert of today

195
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,800
 who tosses a rock, not a slingshot like this,

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,880
 but two straps and a place to hold the rock

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,760
 that you spin around like this and you release it.

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,280
 And this is still something that some areas practice.

199
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
 They still hunt with these things evidently.

200
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,680
 And so in chapter 16, it's this incredible picture

201
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
 where Samuel, the prophet Samuel shows up.

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,420
 Saul is king, Saul looks like a king.

203
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,200
 Saul is what everybody thinks of when they think of a king.

204
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,120
 And then there's this child, this new man,

205
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,080
 this 18 year old David who's a shepherd in the field

206
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,160
 and the prophet Samuel comes and anoints him as king.

207
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,560
 He says, it's not your older brother,

208
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
 it's not your older brother, it's not your older brother,

209
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,560
 no, it's you, David, you're gonna be king.

210
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,320
 And what David does is an incredible act of humility.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,040
 He goes back to being a shepherd.

212
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,460
 He tends to the sheep.

213
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,520
 He goes to be Saul's armor bearer.

214
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,700
 He carries the king's armor.

215
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,360
 He plays the harp for the king.

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
 He's a servant to the king.

217
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
 God says, you're going to be king.

218
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,120
 He says, great, today I'll be a servant.

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
 Would you have the courage,

220
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,240
 would you have the humility to do that?

221
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,240
 If God shows up and says, hey, you're gonna be king,

222
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
 would you be like, well, when?

223
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
 Let's get that show on the road.

224
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
 Or would you be like, great,

225
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,440
 today I'll take the lowliest position possible

226
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,480
 and I'll serve people.

227
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,800
 And so now in chapter 17, it starts like this.

228
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,480
 I'll be in verse two.

229
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,860
 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped

230
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,360
 in the valley of Elah and drew up their battle line

231
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,400
 to meet the Philistines.

232
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,680
 The Philistines occupied one hill

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
 and the Israelites another

234
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
 and the valley was in between them.

235
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
 So the Philistines, they're the sea people

236
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
 who occupied the land of Canaan.

237
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
 This was a land that was promised to God.

238
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,080
 These are wicked, vile people.

239
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,360
 They worship many gods, but their main God was named Beel

240
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,080
 where we get the word Beelzebub or Satan.

241
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,280
 Okay, Satan or Beel and Asherah,

242
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,880
 would, they would have God sex, I guess.

243
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,440
 Okay, and this is, they practiced this kind of gross form

244
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
 of sexuality, a grotesque form of sexuality.

245
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
 It marked these people.

246
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
 Think modern day Satan worshipers.

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
 That's who the Philistines were.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,720
 Okay, they would picture Asherah

249
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,160
 as this kind of well-endowed naked woman

250
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,680
 over a bunch of bloody skulls.

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,680
 It's gross, it's evil, it's wicked, it's dark.

252
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,640
 That's who these people were.

253
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,360
 And they had bronze.

254
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,440
 Okay, so what that meant is basically they had

255
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
 the nuclear weapons of this time.

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,680
 They had an advanced military technology

257
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,800
 that was not available to everyone else.

258
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
 And so not only were they gross warriors,

259
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,320
 they were also incredible.

260
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,640
 They had an incredible military.

261
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,760
 That's who these people were.

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,520
 Verse four, a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath,

263
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
 came out from the Philistine camp.

264
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
 This word champion is very important.

265
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
 When you see it, I want you to circle it in your text.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
 It comes from two Hebrew words,

267
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,720
 one for man and another for go between.

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,120
 This word champion is for the man who goes between,

269
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,760
 and I'll tell you why in just a second.

270
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,640
 His height was six cubits and a span.

271
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,400
 That's around eight feet to nine feet, six inches.

272
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,520
 He's a giant, okay?

273
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,880
 He is a literal live giant.

274
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,400
 He made a bronze helmet on his head

275
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,480
 and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze

276
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
 weighing 5,000 shekels.

277
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
 On his legs, he wore bronze greaves

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,720
 and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.

279
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
 His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod

280
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,960
 and its iron point weighed 600 shekels or 15 pounds.

281
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,560
 His shield bearer went ahead of him.

282
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,680
 This dude's got somebody whose only job

283
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,720
 is to carry his shield so that he doesn't get hit by stuff.

284
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,880
 Can we just agree that's the worst job in the world?

285
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,440
 Can you think of a worse job?

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,800
 And he failed miserably on this account.

287
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,600
 And so, Goliath shouted.

288
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,680
 He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel,

289
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,920
 "Why do you come out and line up and battle?

290
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
 "Am I not a Philistine?

291
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
 "And are you not the servants of Saul?

292
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,980
 "Choose a man and have him come down to me.

293
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,500
 "If he is able to fight and kill me,

294
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,020
 "we will become your subjects.

295
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,620
 "But if I overcome him and kill him,

296
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,280
 "you will become our subjects and serve us."

297
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,660
 Then the Philistine said,

298
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,640
 "This day I defy the armies of Israel.

299
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,160
 "Give me a man and let us fight each other

300
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,960
 "that we're champion."

301
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,960
 It's this winner-takes-all mentality.

302
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,040
 I will fight on behalf of my whole army.

303
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,280
 Send a man, let's duel, and the winner takes all.

304
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,200
 Let's go.

305
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,640
 And he's calling them out.

306
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,360
 This is the equivalent of your mama.

307
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
 What are you gonna do about it?

308
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,480
 Nothing, that's what I thought.

309
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
 Mic drop, get over it.

310
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,840
 He's just talking madness to these guys.

311
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,600
 And so my first point this evening

312
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,420
 is arrogance is misplaced faith.

313
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,080
 Arrogance is misplaced faith.

314
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 Cockiness, confidence in yourself is misplaced faith.

315
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,760
 See, Goliath was, he was as courageous as David.

316
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,840
 We think, well, this story is about courageous David.

317
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,200
 Goliath is just as courageous as David.

318
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
 Maybe more courageous.

319
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,760
 Like, he's there before David ever shows up on the scene.

320
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,880
 He's like, "Send me any guy, your strongest guy,

321
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,700
 "your biggest, baddest, fastest guy.

322
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,260
 "Send him to fight me."

323
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,040
 He's very courageous.

324
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,400
 But his courage comes from the wrong place.

325
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,760
 His courage comes from his faith and his stature,

326
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,040
 his faith and his strength, his faith and his possessions,

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,020
 his faith and his technology.

328
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,880
 He's big, he's tall, he's strong.

329
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,880
 He has 125 pounds of bronze on him, this text tells us.

330
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,160
 The tip of his spear weighs 15 pounds, this text tells us.

331
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,120
 He has a man who carries his shield.

332
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,080
 Some modern commentaries would tell you

333
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,600
 that Goliath is an underdog.

334
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
 Like, the text is trying to tell you that he's an underdog.

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,600
 This text goes into great detail in the Hebrew

336
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
 to make one point to you.

337
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,120
 Goliath is a bad warrior of a man.

338
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,080
 He, by logical, worldly standards,

339
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,160
 is absolutely not the underdog.

340
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,620
 He is the favored victor here.

341
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,700
 That's Goliath.

342
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,200
 And so his arrogance comes from trusting in his own ability.

343
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,460
 He has a cocky courage.

344
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,080
 Proverbs 16, 18 says that pride goes before the fall.

345
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,800
 And the Bible goes on over and over,

346
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,480
 this is what I want you to hear me.

347
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,820
 The Bible goes on to tell you over and over

348
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,420
 that people who trust in themselves are enemies of God.

349
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,600
 That people who do what they want,

350
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,040
 they live for themselves, they trust in their own abilities

351
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,080
 are enemies of God.

352
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,660
 And I think for so many of us, we're like Goliath.

353
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,300
 Like, we say we have a faith,

354
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,700
 but we live our lives by our own abilities,

355
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,900
 our own strengths, our own degree, our own relationships,

356
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,080
 those who we know, those are the things we worry about,

357
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,240
 those are the things that we obsess about.

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,080
 And the Bible says, the Scripture says,

359
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,600
 this book teaches us that God has distributed talents to you

360
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
 not for you, but for him, so that you would plug

361
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,840
 into his body and those talents would come alive

362
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,880
 as you serve others in the name of God

363
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,680
 and you serve God with those talents.

364
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,880
 That's why you were created.

365
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,760
 If you're not doing that, you are missing out

366
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
 on your purpose of life, you are living without a purpose.

367
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 Let me say it more strong.

368
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,480
 You are wasting your life if you are not doing that.

369
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,160
 You are wasting your life.

370
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,500
 And so let me ask you a question,

371
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,860
 what is the source of your confidence this evening?

372
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,080
 Is it a degree?

373
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,120
 Is it who you know?

374
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,820
 Is it a drive in you?

375
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,740
 Is it, it's like entrepreneurship, is it your looks?

376
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,660
 Is it the way you look?

377
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,640
 Is it your physique, the way you work out?

378
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,920
 Is it your income, is it your car or your possessions?

379
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,800
 Is this where your faith comes from?

380
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,220
 Is this where your confidence comes from?

381
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,140
 Is it your strength, your popularity?

382
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,320
 Is it your address?

383
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,400
 Is it your family's name?

384
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,260
 If it is anything but God, you've missed it.

385
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,460
 Those things don't define you.

386
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,360
 You're a child of God, the creator of the heavens

387
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,060
 and the earth, 100 years from now,

388
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,960
 that's the only thing that will matter.

389
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,260
 And so I think we're like Goliath

390
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,900
 in that we seek to trust in our stature

391
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,640
 and our strength over our savior.

392
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,440
 See, the enemies of the Christian faith,

393
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,780
 they have to trust in their abilities.

394
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,240
 They have nothing else to trust in.

395
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,580
 All they're left with is their degree.

396
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,740
 All they're left with is their education.

397
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,200
 All they're left with is their abilities,

398
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,840
 that part of their resume that say skills and abilities.

399
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,500
 That's all they got.

400
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,640
 But you, Christian, you have something

401
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,800
 much greater than that, much more incredible than that.

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,100
 Goliath, he's an enemy of God.

403
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,540
 He was prideful in something other than God.

404
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,840
 And when you become prideful about something,

405
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,920
 you are playing in the enemy's territory

406
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,420
 when you are prideful of something other than God.

407
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,320
 And so the question for us is today,

408
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,620
 who are the enemies of God?

409
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,560
 Who are those people, the groups out there

410
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,360
 that gather around and say,

411
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,860
 "We are prideful over something other than God,

412
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,320
 "over the one true God.

413
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,060
 "We find identity in other things.

414
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,900
 "We practice other things.

415
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,700
 "We work in other ways.

416
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,900
 "We do other things."

417
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,320
 Who are those Goliaths today?

418
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,120
 And how do we lovingly, winsomely, kindly,

419
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,840
 but courageously stand in opposition

420
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,380
 to those who stand in opposition to God?

421
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,340
 His culture always has and always will

422
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,020
 until Jesus returns, mocked God.

423
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,520
 James 4, 6 says, "God opposes the proud,

424
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,180
 "but gives grace to the humble.

425
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
 "He favors the humble."

426
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,680
 If you're here in your pride,

427
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,420
 for you stand in opposition to the creator

428
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,760
 of the heavens and the earth.

429
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,940
 When you trust in fleeting things, you face failure.

430
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,440
 When you put your faith in fleeting things,

431
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,860
 you face failure.

432
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,360
 Verse 11, "On hearing the Philistines' words,

433
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,600
 "Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified."

434
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
 And he goes on to say that David,

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,440
 he's the youngest son of Jesse,

436
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
 and Jesse was from Bethlehem in Judah,

437
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,080
 telling you that Christ, Jesus Christ,

438
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,340
 comes from the lineage of King David.

439
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,540
 Jesse had eight sons.

440
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,820
 He was very old.

441
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,520
 And his three oldest sons followed Saul to war.

442
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,960
 That was Eliab, Ben-Hadad, and Shammah.

443
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,880
 They're at war.

444
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,560
 And it says, "For 40 days," verse 16,

445
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,860
 "For 40 days the Philistine came forward

446
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,500
 "every morning and evening and took his stand."

447
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,600
 This 40 days is the time of judgment in the scripture.

448
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,100
 It rained in Noah's time for how long?

449
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,340
 40 days.

450
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,600
 Jesus was tempted in the desert for how long?

451
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
 40 days.

452
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,980
 And for 40 days, Goliath, the Philistine,

453
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,720
 stands in opposition to God's army.

454
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,480
 It is a time of judgment for God's people.

455
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
 And so Jesse comes to David and says,

456
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,280
 "Hey, I want you to go check on your brothers."

457
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,620
 He says, "Hey, I want you to take grain

458
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,120
 "and bread and roasted corn and ten cheeses

459
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,860
 "to the commander of their unit."

460
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,920
 He's the cheese boy.

461
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,160
 That's who he is.

462
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,960
 He's coming and bringing them hors d'oeuvres.

463
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,000
 That's what David, he's like, "You want some gouda?"

464
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,200
 That's what he's doing.

465
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,940
 And so David leaves the sheep with a shepherd

466
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,700
 and goes where the armies are lined up.

467
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,240
 Verse 22.

468
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,300
 "David left his things with the keeper of supplies.

469
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,500
 "He ran to the battle lines

470
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,840
 "and asked his brothers how they were."

471
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,340
 He's like, "You want some refreshments?

472
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,720
 "A concession stand, evidently."

473
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
 "As he was talking with them,

474
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
 "Goliath, the Philistine, champion from Gath,

475
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,320
 "stepped out from his lines

476
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,320
 "and shouted his usual defiance."

477
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,260
 And David heard it.

478
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,120
 "Whenever the Israelites saw the man,

479
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,060
 "they all fled from him in great fear."

480
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,600
 Now, the Israelites had been saying,

481
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,640
 "Do you see how this man keeps coming out?

482
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
 "He comes out to defy Israel.

483
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,340
 "The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him.

484
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,840
 "He will also give him his daughter in marriage

485
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,940
 "and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel."

486
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,140
 This text says this three times.

487
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,580
 Okay, whoever will kill this guy,

488
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,880
 he gets the girl, okay?

489
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,780
 He doesn't have to pay taxes, right?

490
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,580
 He has all of these things.

491
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,960
 He goes on to being royalty, right?

492
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,920
 It's a sweet deal.

493
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,620
 He gets money, he gets the girl,

494
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,320
 and he doesn't have to pay taxes still today,

495
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,460
 a very sweet deal.

496
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,400
 And so David hears this.

497
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,040
 He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?"

498
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800
 He asks, he's like, "Hey, tell me this again.

499
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,840
 "What are you saying?

500
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,300
 "What, like, you gotta be paid

501
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,680
 "to stand in opposition to that

502
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,280
 "and stand in opposition to God?

503
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,580
 "Hold on, tell me again what's gonna happen?

504
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,220
 "Are you serious?"

505
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,460
 In verse 29, I'm sorry, verse 28.

506
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,260
 "When Eliab," that's David's oldest brother,

507
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,000
 "heard him speaking with the men,

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,800
 "he burned with anger at him and asked,

509
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,660
 "'Why have you come down here?

510
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,400
 "'And whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?

511
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,040
 "'I know how conceited you are

512
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,700
 "'and how wicked your heart is.

513
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,880
 "'You came down here only to watch the battle.'"

514
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
 Isn't it interesting that David's faithfulness

515
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,680
 is misunderstood as arrogance?

516
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,240
 This is gonna happen to you.

517
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,780
 People are gonna say, as you choose not to do wrong,

518
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,580
 as you choose to worship the one true God,

519
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,160
 they're gonna say, "Why are you so arrogant?

520
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,960
 "What, do you think you're better than us?

521
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,820
 "No, no, no, why are you judging us?

522
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,660
 "What are you talking about judging?

523
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,260
 "I'm not gonna do that.

524
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,400
 "I don't need to go do that.

525
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,700
 "Why are you so arrogant?"

526
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
 That's what, this is gonna happen.

527
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,700
 His faithfulness is seen as arrogance.

528
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,140
 Verse 29, "Now what have I done?"

529
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,340
 David said, "Can't I even speak?"

530
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,580
 "He then turned away to someone else

531
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,820
 "and brought up the same matter

532
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,340
 "and the men answered him as before."

533
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,180
 What's gonna happen?

534
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,940
 You're telling me that this guy gets the money,

535
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,680
 no taxes and the girl?

536
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,020
 "What David said was overheard and reported to Saul

537
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,960
 "and Saul sent for him.

538
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,980
 "David said to Saul,

539
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,200
 "'Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine.

540
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,720
 "'Your servant will go and fight him.'

541
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,140
 "Saul replied, 'You are not able to go out

542
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,860
 "'against this Philistine and fight him.

543
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,540
 "'You are only a young man

544
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,360
 "'and he has been a warrior from his youth.'"

545
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,020
 And so I told you the first thing

546
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,580
 is when you trust in yourself,

547
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,820
 when you have faith in yourself,

548
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,860
 it can appear as arrogance.

549
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,700
 It can also appear as something else, fear.

550
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,460
 Anytime you put too much faith in yourself,

551
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,740
 it can be fear.

552
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,500
 It's this simple equation that is,

553
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,620
 if you look at the situation,

554
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,720
 you look at what you have,

555
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,800
 if you have more than what the situation calls for,

556
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,860
 you have a false confidence.

557
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,900
 If you have less than what the situation calls for,

558
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,960
 you have fear.

559
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,380
 Okay?

560
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,940
 This is a simple math.

561
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,180
 This is faith placed in the wrong thing.

562
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,740
 My second point is fear is misplaced faith.

563
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,780
 Fear, the emotion of fear is misplaced faith.

564
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,460
 It's like, what, what, what?

565
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,820
 Will I be single forever?

566
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,480
 What if I never make that much money?

567
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,860
 What if I get laid off?

568
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,420
 What if I am not good enough?

569
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,740
 What if I don't have what it takes

570
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,100
 to get through that situation?

571
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,660
 What if your God does?

572
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,000
 What if your God is so big that he speaks things

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
 and they happen?

574
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,940
 What if he numbered your days?

575
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,700
 What if he ordained everything that's gonna happen to you,

576
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,060
 everything you're gonna walk in?

577
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,260
 What if he's enough?

578
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,100
 What if that?

579
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,060
 What if he's so powerful that he can move you

580
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,580
 through death back to life?

581
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,220
 That you can live in paradise with him

582
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,380
 forever and ever and ever

583
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,500
 so that your little worries in this world,

584
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,260
 these little things that you face,

585
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,700
 they're not that big for him.

586
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,540
 What you see as a giant is not a giant for him.

587
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,460
 Or it's his giant.

588
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,320
 The Israelites are terrified.

589
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,800
 Saul is terrified.

590
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,900
 And in simple logic, they should be.

591
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,940
 If they're operating in the logic of this world,

592
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,260
 they should be terrified because they see a giant.

593
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,580
 But if they're operating in the world of the supernatural,

594
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,260
 a God who created everything,

595
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,500
 why would they even think of being afraid?

596
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,860
 Say, oh, that's a giant.

597
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,980
 Man, my God is so much bigger than a giant.

598
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,740
 Oh, that's a warrior.

599
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,500
 But my God, that's my God's warrior.

600
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,100
 He controls everything.

601
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,040
 Why would I even think about being afraid?

602
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,760
 Oh, no, my senses, my common senses tell me to be afraid.

603
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,720
 But my supernatural heart tells me not to fear anything

604
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,820
 but God himself.

605
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:21,900
 This would be what some of us would do, right?

606
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,740
 We'd be afraid.

607
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,260
 We'd be like, hey, come here, guys.

608
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,380
 Let me tell you why you shouldn't fight Goliath.

609
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,300
 No, he's really big and he's got bronze.

610
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,260
 And this is why God would not want you to do this.

611
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,160
 And David's like, hey, give me a rock.

612
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,020
 Any stones around here?

613
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,980
 I'm tired of this guy mouthing off, man.

614
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,280
 I gotta take care of this.

615
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,120
 Hey, come here, David.

616
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,820
 Let's sit down and let's apply some logic to this situation

617
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,660
 because I've been looking at Goliath and he's big.

618
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,060
 He's like nine feet tall or something

619
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,940
 and you're not very big.

620
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,220
 And he's got a sword and you don't.

621
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,860
 And man, let's just talk about this for a minute

622
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,700
 because I don't know that this is

623
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,820
 what God would want for you.

624
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,760
 Hey, you talk about it.

625
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,120
 I'm gonna go get a rock.

626
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:08,580
 The only thing necessary for evil to prevail

627
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,240
 is for good people to do nothing.

628
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,380
 The only thing necessary in your lifetime

629
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,020
 for evil to win is for good people to do nothing.

630
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,720
 And friends, I want you to know that

631
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,260
 Goliath is not the problem here.

632
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,540
 Unbelieving people are the problem here.

633
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,300
 Goliath is not the issue here.

634
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,860
 Unbelieving people, that's the issue here.

635
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
 Goliath is no problem for God,

636
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,260
 but God's plan has always been to work

637
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,860
 through the faithfulness of others.

638
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,760
 And so if there's no one there willing to be faithful,

639
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,260
 that presents a problem for God's plan.

640
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,560
 Goliath isn't the issue.

641
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,900
 People sitting on their rear ends,

642
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,920
 not wanting to do anything but pursue their comfort,

643
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,120
 that's the issue.

644
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,500
 Giant ain't the issue.

645
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,120
 Us pursuing the American dream

646
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,280
 and American Christianity, that's the issue.

647
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,420
 Giants aren't the issue.

648
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,000
 And so what's the bigger disgrace?

649
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,160
 Goliath's blaspheming or Israel's unbelief?

650
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,000
 I've heard it said that courage cannot exist

651
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 unless fear is present.

652
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,160
 Unless fear is there, there can't be courage.

653
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,000
 I will tell you for Christians,

654
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,400
 unless faith is there, there can't be courage.

655
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,440
 Unless we believe in something greater than ourselves,

656
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,820
 we cannot act out of courage.

657
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,040
 Because if we did, it wouldn't be courage,

658
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,080
 it would just be cockiness.

659
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,060
 It would be false arrogance.

660
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,800
 It would be strength and trust in our own abilities

661
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,720
 and God determines the outcome.

662
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,440
 God topples giants.

663
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,960
 You may think you're good enough.

664
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
 You may think you have money.

665
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,120
 You may think you have a palace.

666
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,560
 You may think you have everything that the world wants

667
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,280
 and he can shake it loose like a trap door

668
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,480
 out from underneath you.

669
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,640
 And you're less devastated

670
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,000
 because you placed your faith in the wrong things

671
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,040
 and I've seen it happen with my own eyes

672
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,360
 over and over and over again.

673
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,320
 And it's gonna happen to some of you here.

674
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,480
 It's gonna happen to some of you.

675
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,120
 You're gonna leave here, you're gonna hear this message

676
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
 and you're gonna be like,

677
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
 I know, I'm gonna be the exception, man.

678
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,740
 Like a trap door.

679
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,040
 It's gonna fall out from underneath you.

680
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 May it never be.

681
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,880
 And so let me ask you two questions.

682
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,600
 Two questions.

683
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,100
 I want you to think about 'em.

684
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,880
 What do you fear?

685
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,600
 What do you fear?

686
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
 (coughing)

687
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,640
 The second question.

688
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
 Why?

689
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,520
 Why do you fear it?

690
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,900
 What are you afraid of?

691
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,960
 I get discouraged because I've noticed

692
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,160
 that mature Christians seem to grow uncourageous.

693
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,840
 Like the Israelites in the story.

694
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,040
 Some people, the longer they know God,

695
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
 they learn more about him.

696
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,420
 The less courageous they become,

697
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,120
 they get so much wisdom.

698
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,080
 It's like, I don't think we need to do anything there.

699
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,340
 That's a giant.

700
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,760
 And I've noticed, 'cause I've done this for a little while,

701
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,980
 that a lot of times it's the brand new believers.

702
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,240
 Like, I just trusted in Christ,

703
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
 why didn't anybody tell me this?

704
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,960
 He died for my sins, he came back from the death,

705
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,440
 what do I have to be afraid of?

706
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,800
 Hey, where is hell and where is a water gun?

707
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,380
 'Cause I'm going, you know, like those guys, right?

708
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,280
 I've just noticed this, that sometimes those people

709
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,400
 are the most courageous and others are like,

710
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,880
 no, I've wised up, I grew up in Sunday school, man,

711
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 you don't wanna do that, hell is hot.

712
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,840
 You know?

713
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,440
 And I don't know why, it bothers me.

714
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,680
 It bothers me.

715
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,240
 I think sometimes we're growing towards God

716
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,680
 and our faith is getting smaller and smaller

717
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,600
 and smaller and smaller.

718
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,800
 We've believed some lie in this American dream

719
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 that God wants me to be comfortable

720
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,720
 and he doesn't really want me to get uncomfortable.

721
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,320
 And I can just take it easy and be in church

722
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
 and Sunday school and everything's gonna be okay

723
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
 and Jesus comes back and I get to go to heaven

724
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,880
 and it's all good.

725
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,580
 Yeah, but you wasted your days, man.

726
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,300
 Like, what did you do with your life?

727
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,220
 I think we read this story

728
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:38,540
 and we think, man, this was David's moment.

729
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,380
 Like, David knew, like, this is a dream situation,

730
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,620
 David's gonna fight the giant and he gets to show people

731
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,300
 that he's courageous, David wasn't courageous.

732
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,780
 Okay, let me say something.

733
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,420
 If you say he is, that's fine, I won't disagree with you

734
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,060
 and that's fine, but I'm just gonna say,

735
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,500
 to make this point,

736
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,380
 and I believe it's true, David wasn't courageous.

737
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,340
 He was faithful.

738
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,260
 David did what David had always done.

739
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,220
 I'm just gonna trust God, guys, as a giant.

740
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,100
 I mean, I've been trusting God my whole life,

741
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,620
 it's kinda worked out for me.

742
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,580
 Like, every day I apply faith

743
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,300
 and in this situation it's no different,

744
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,900
 I'm just going to apply faith.

745
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
 I'm gonna have the courage to do right

746
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,900
 and the courage not to do wrong, okay?

747
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,220
 This guy's doing wrong, I'm doing right,

748
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,300
 this guy's doing wrong, I just have faith

749
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,980
 that God doesn't like that dude,

750
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,420
 that big dude talking about him,

751
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,540
 so I'm just gonna step up and give God a chance

752
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,740
 to use me if he wants to,

753
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,660
 but I'm just going to have faith, okay?

754
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,460
 This was an everyday, normal faith for David,

755
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,500
 it's the way that he lived,

756
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,020
 and so you can ask yourself the question,

757
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,420
 what is God asking you to do today that requires courage?

758
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,820
 And if you think of something specific, that's great,

759
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,700
 what is God asking you to do today that requires courage?

760
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,380
 And here's what I'm saying, everything!

761
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,660
 Live, that you would walk by faith,

762
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,140
 that you would put yourself in situations

763
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,860
 where you need to be rescued,

764
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,700
 that God would have to intervene,

765
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,820
 that you would live so courageously, so boldly,

766
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,140
 so very, very different than what you've seen

767
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,820
 from your friends in America who call themselves Christian,

768
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
 you would be radical, you would say,

769
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,020
 I'm going against the grain for the name of Jesus,

770
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,580
 not just to stand out, to draw attention to me,

771
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,940
 but to shine a light on him,

772
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,460
 to show the world who he is and how amazing he is

773
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,940
 and what he's done for me.

774
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:39,040
 I just got back from vacation.

775
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,100
 I didn't get a Palm Beach TAN membership,

776
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,620
 no, I've been on the beach with my family,

777
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,660
 it's been incredible, and we go somewhere once a year,

778
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,740
 and this was that once a year,

779
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,140
 and great time, man, on vacation.

780
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,100
 Didn't really check emails much.

781
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,460
 You sit back about two days,

782
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,420
 it takes kind of for the Lord to calm my heart,

783
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,980
 and then I'm there, and on vacation you get pampered,

784
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,460
 you know, it's just like the meals are taken care of,

785
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,100
 and there's not a lot of thinking,

786
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,740
 not a lot of planning, not a lot of responsibilities.

787
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,560
 And what happens is about day four or five,

788
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,180
 my heart gets really used to it.

789
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,740
 And I start, I've been this really familiar to me,

790
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,940
 I'm like, man, maybe I could have a shack on the beach,

791
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,380
 man, like maybe this is what we should do,

792
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,580
 like where would my kids go to school?

793
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,180
 Yeah, I bet we could make that work.

794
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,900
 Maybe like a surf stand or something.

795
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,980
 Some of my, no, I just kind of want to take it easy,

796
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,300
 you know, like this is, I like the pace here.

797
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,380
 A little slower.

798
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,260
 Man, I didn't worry about anything today,

799
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,660
 I mean, just like, this is okay,

800
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,980
 and I start living in that, I start daydreaming,

801
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,660
 I start thinking, man, maybe I don't have to go back.

802
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
 Maybe I can just take life easy and coast.

803
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,460
 And it's like this internal war in me,

804
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,300
 because that raises up,

805
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,420
 and I kind of begin to feed that thought.

806
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,460
 Like some of us feed fears, whatever we feed grows, right?

807
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,740
 And I begin to feed that thought,

808
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,040
 and that thought grows and it grows and it grows,

809
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,980
 and then praise God, I wake up.

810
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,980
 Oh man, I want to change the world.

811
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,680
 Send me back to Dallas and give me a rock.

812
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,140
 And a couple thousand young adults.

813
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,780
 Let's do work, man.

814
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,900
 There's Goliaths in our midst,

815
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,580
 and I don't want to waste my life.

816
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,340
 I don't want to get up to heaven

817
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,140
 with a collection of seashells, man.

818
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,300
 Okay, that's not what I'm after, that's not the dream.

819
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
 That what's so interesting about that whole story

820
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,020
 is my greatest fear,

821
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,620
 if I was to be as vulnerable with you as I can,

822
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,340
 my greatest fear in life is that I would waste my life.

823
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,940
 That I would get to the end of this race

824
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,940
 and it didn't matter, there would be nothing.

825
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,060
 No one saved, no one in heaven because of the way I lived.

826
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,620
 No eternal significance whatsoever,

827
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,500
 no treasure stored up there with God, nothing.

828
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,940
 Fleeting things, bricks and mortar that will crumble.

829
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,200
 Collections, seashell collections.

830
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,540
 That's my greatest fear,

831
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,880
 and yet that's the war inside of me when I taste it.

832
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,780
 I don't want that for me,

833
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,520
 and I don't want that for you,

834
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,960
 'cause it ain't the Christian life.

835
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
 The Christian life is take up your cross and follow him.

836
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,780
 Live on mission, be a light.

837
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,700
 Tell others about the way that they can live forever

838
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,500
 and ever and ever and ever with God.

839
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,840
 Oppose evil, stand in opposition to that

840
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,920
 which stands in opposition to God courageously.

841
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,640
 Share truth, the life-changing truth of the gospel.

842
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,900
 But we don't do that when we see Goliath.

843
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,860
 We do that every day.

844
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,180
 The day before I left for vacation, I went to the gym

845
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,460
 'cause I was gonna have my shirt off,

846
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,660
 and that's what you do is you go to the gym.

847
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,660
 But I worked out legs, so that breaks down a little bit.

848
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,420
 So I went to the gym, worked out legs,

849
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,680
 and I don't work out legs ever.

850
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,700
 And so on this particular day I did, and it was hard.

851
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,700
 And here's what I learned is my legs are embarrassingly weak

852
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,020
 like really, really weak, okay?

853
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,500
 Like people are laughing at me in the gym.

854
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,740
 Like toothpicks under a squat bar are weak.

855
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,860
 Like that's me.

856
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,840
 And the reason is is because as I said,

857
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,180
 I never work out legs.

858
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,260
 And if you never exercise something, it's weak.

859
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,760
 You don't exercise your faith when you see a Goliath.

860
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,260
 You use the faith you exercise every day

861
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,460
 when you see Goliath.

862
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,480
 Do you hear me?

863
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,140
 You can't just say, okay, now I see a Goliath,

864
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
 let me use my faith.

865
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,540
 No, every day you use your faith

866
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,920
 so that when you see Goliath, it's just normative.

867
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,780
 I'm just gonna put my faith into practice, let's do work.

868
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:03,540
 And so stop partying and do something with your life.

869
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,380
 Stop wasting your life and use it.

870
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,500
 Verse 34, "But David said to Saul,

871
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,760
 "your servant has been keeping his father's sheep."

872
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,880
 Saul's like, you can't do this.

873
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,860
 He's like, yes I can.

874
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,800
 I've been a shepherd.

875
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,460
 "When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep

876
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,600
 "from the flock, I went after it.

877
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,700
 "I struck it and I rescued the sheep from its mouth.

878
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,480
 "When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair.

879
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,960
 "I struck it and killed it.

880
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,700
 "Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.

881
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,460
 "This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them

882
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,200
 "because he has defied the armies of the living God."

883
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,120
 And you might be tempted to think here that,

884
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,680
 well, David's kind of arrogant.

885
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,420
 I mean, he's boasting in his skill

886
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,780
 against the lion and the bear.

887
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,340
 And he's like, man, this, you know,

888
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,860
 same thing I did to them, I'm gonna do to this Philistine.

889
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,500
 He's boasting in his gifts and his strength.

890
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,700
 Let me, hold on, let me show you verse 37, the next verse.

891
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,720
 "No, it's the Lord who rescued me.

892
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,120
 "It's Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Nisi, El Shaddai,

893
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,600
 "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

894
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,160
 "the creator of the universe who came in and rescued me.

895
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
 "And the same God who rescued me from the lion

896
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,760
 "and the bear is going to rescue me

897
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,880
 "from this uncircumcised Philistine

898
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,840
 "who defies the armies of the living God."

899
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,960
 My God's got me.

900
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,420
 And I love that he says he rescued me.

901
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,800
 I needed to be rescued.

902
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
 How humble is that?

903
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,700
 I was in a situation, I consistently put myself

904
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,560
 in a situation that if God doesn't show up,

905
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,200
 I'm lunch for a lion.

906
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,160
 If God doesn't rescue me, this evil will overpower me

907
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,340
 but he will rescue me.

908
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,640
 The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion

909
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
 and the paw of the bear will rescue me

910
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,240
 from the hand of this Philistine.

911
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,160
 Saul said to David, "Go and the Lord be with you."

912
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
 It looks like he has a faith.

913
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,680
 "Go and the Lord will be with you," but he doesn't.

914
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,240
 Now come back, let me dress you in my tunic

915
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,560
 and my coat of armor and bronze helmet.

916
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,640
 And David fastened on his sword over the tunic

917
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,480
 and tried walking around because he was not used to them.

918
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,840
 Saul's like Goliath, he has faith in his stuff.

919
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,780
 "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul,

920
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,280
 "because I'm not used to them."

921
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,980
 So he took them off and then he took his staff in his hand,

922
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,600
 chose five smooth stones from the stream,

923
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,500
 put them in a pouch of a shepherd's bag

924
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,480
 and with his sling in his hand approached the Philistine.

925
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
 You might be tempted to say here,

926
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,240
 "Well, if you really had a faith,

927
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
 "why did he grab five stones?

928
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,900
 "Why didn't he just grab one stone?"

929
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,680
 And I love this in the text, it's a historical account.

930
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,840
 Grab five stones, that's why it's here, grab five.

931
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,520
 And he doesn't know how God's gonna use it.

932
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,600
 Like I could go one further and be like,

933
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
 "Well, if he really had a faith,

934
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,080
 "why would he grab any stones?"

935
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,320
 'Cause he just went to throw in blows

936
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
 or something out there, like, "Why does he need any rocks?"

937
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,040
 You know, if you really have, and here's the deal,

938
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,600
 he's saying, "Hey, I don't know how God's gonna do this.

939
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,500
 "I'm gonna go prepared and I'm gonna trust

940
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,920
 "that God is going to intervene in my efforts,

941
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,300
 "in my preparation.

942
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,560
 "It's gonna be his power working through me.

943
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,220
 "But I'm gonna look at the situation

944
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,720
 "and I'm gonna take what I need,

945
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,280
 "what I think I need in my human logic

946
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,000
 "and trust that God's gonna intervene and help me.

947
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 "And so in case one misses or two misses,

948
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,160
 "I don't know if God's gonna use the fourth stone

949
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,240
 "or the third stone, I'll take five, let's go."

950
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,660
 (congregation laughing)

951
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,760
 Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer

952
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 in front of him, #dirtyjobs, kept coming closer to David.

953
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,820
 He looked David over and saw that he was little more

954
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,560
 than a boy, glowing with health and handsome,

955
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,800
 and he despised him.

956
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760
 He said to David, "Am I a dog that you come at me with sticks

957
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,860
 "and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

958
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,160
 "Come here," he said, "and I will give your flesh

959
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,960
 "to the birds and the wild animals."

960
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
 I think he's angry.

961
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,360
 David said to the Philistine, "You come against me

962
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,900
 "with sword and spear and javelin,

963
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,380
 "but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty,

964
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,220
 "the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.

965
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,700
 "This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands

966
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
 "and I'll strike you down and cut off your head.

967
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,580
 "This very day I will give the carcasses

968
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,200
 "of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals,

969
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,440
 "and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.

970
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,540
 "All those gathered here will know

971
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,400
 "that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves,

972
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,860
 "for the battle is the Lord's,

973
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,760
 "and he will give all of you into our hands."

974
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,920
 As the Philistine moved closer to attack him,

975
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,360
 David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.

976
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,840
 Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone,

977
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,960
 he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead.

978
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,200
 The stone sank into his forehead

979
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,120
 and he fell face down on the ground.

980
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,240
 So David triumphed over the Philistine

981
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,720
 with a sling and a stone,

982
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,920
 and without a sword in his hand,

983
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,520
 he struck down the Philistine and killed him.

984
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:13,600
 He had his faith in the right place.

985
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:21,340
 The third point, faith placed in God always prevails.

986
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,400
 Faith placed in God always prevails.

987
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,680
 Faith is complete trust or confidence

988
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,720
 in someone or something.

989
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,880
 David had complete faith,

990
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,720
 complete trust or confidence in God.

991
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,120
 David's faith was in someone who would never disappoint.

992
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,080
 He's called a man after God's own heart.

993
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,720
 If you don't know what that means,

994
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,840
 Acts 13, verse 22 tells us,

995
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,240
 says that God says about David,

996
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,060
 "He will do anything that I ask of him."

997
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,860
 How great is that?

998
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,880
 God says, "I look down,"

999
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,200
 could you imagine if God says that about you?

1000
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,340
 "I look at her and I say,

1001
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,000
 "'She will do anything that I ask of her.

1002
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,540
 "'She'll do anything that I ask of her.

1003
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,680
 "'He'll do anything that I ask of him.

1004
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,240
 "'He's gonna steward money the way I ask him to.

1005
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,700
 "'He's gonna date the way that I ask him to.

1006
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,600
 "'He's gonna pursue purity the way that I ask him to.

1007
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,180
 "'He's gonna pursue sobriety the way that I ask him to.

1008
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,580
 "'He does everything that I ask him to.

1009
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,280
 "'He's faithful, she's faithful.

1010
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,960
 "'Everything that I ask of her, she does.

1011
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,720
 "'They work as though they are working for me, not for man.

1012
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,400
 "'They do everything that I ask of him.'"

1013
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,340
 2 Chronicles 16, verse nine says,

1014
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,500
 "For the eyes of the Lord reigns throughout the earth

1015
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
 "to strengthen those whose hearts

1016
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,440
 "are fully committed to him."

1017
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,320
 He looks down, he says,

1018
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,400
 "Hey, I wanna fight some Goliaths today.

1019
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,760
 "Whose heart's mine?

1020
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,780
 "Whose heart do I have?

1021
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,880
 "Who do I wanna use?"

1022
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,920
 In 1999, around the same time

1023
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,860
 I'd gotten that cowardly little skirmish,

1024
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,840
 there was a shooting in Columbine High School.

1025
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,140
 Two guys came in with weapons and pipe bombs and guns

1026
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,940
 wanting to wreak havoc on the school,

1027
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,400
 and specifically they targeted Christians.

1028
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,160
 They were upset, confused young men.

1029
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,360
 They went up to a girl named Rachel Scott,

1030
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,320
 a known Christian on the campus.

1031
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,600
 They shot her in each of her legs

1032
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,920
 and shot her in her torso.

1033
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,520
 And then they asked her again,

1034
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,820
 "Are you a Christian?" with a gun to her head.

1035
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,560
 And she looked them in the eyes and she said,

1036
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,720
 "You know that I am."

1037
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,360
 By an eyewitness account who was there.

1038
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,680
 And they shot her.

1039
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,680
 And they said, "Then go be with him."

1040
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,500
 And what happened out of that was the Rachel Scott movement,

1041
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,420
 the gospel moved throughout public schools,

1042
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,360
 all throughout our nation.

1043
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,860
 It continues to do so.

1044
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,840
 The movement even from '99 gains momentum.

1045
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,300
 And I remember Christians in that day saying,

1046
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,680
 "Man, I wish somebody would do that to me,

1047
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,560
 "put a gun to my head, ask me if I'm a Christian.

1048
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,960
 "And show I'm, I'll show that, you know."

1049
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,660
 I'm like, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."

1050
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,320
 Why don't you show them today

1051
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,320
 without a gun to your head?

1052
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,220
 And they're like, "Oh man, there was a Goliath here,

1053
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,860
 "you know, give me a slingshot."

1054
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,900
 Well, how about the way you date?

1055
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,580
 How about what you find identity in?

1056
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,360
 How about the way you party?

1057
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,700
 How about how you spend your weekends?

1058
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,820
 How about your thought life, your obsessions?

1059
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,420
 You're so courageous.

1060
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,020
 I wanna courageously change the world,

1061
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,260
 but I don't wanna courageously change myself.

1062
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,380
 Right, I want the faith to change the world,

1063
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,580
 but I don't have the faith to change myself.

1064
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,920
 Right?

1065
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,260
 God is looking for someone who has the courage

1066
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,560
 to do the right thing and not do the wrong thing.

1067
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,120
 Sometimes it takes more courage not to do the wrong thing

1068
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,320
 than to do the right thing,

1069
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,880
 but he's using someone who practices their faith.

1070
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,200
 On this account, David had the faith to fight a giant,

1071
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,760
 but David had a low point in his career.

1072
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,040
 It's when he lacked faith.

1073
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,840
 He put faith in his desires.

1074
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,080
 It's 2 Samuel chapter 11,

1075
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,360
 when he saw someone by the name of Bathsheba,

1076
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,840
 and he took another man's wife and he slept with her,

1077
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,100
 and it was David's downfall.

1078
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,740
 It was the beginning of the end for King David

1079
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,400
 because he lost that faith.

1080
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,700
 He lost sight of that faith,

1081
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,600
 and he trusted something other than God.

1082
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:43,520
 Verse 51, but on this day, he was victorious.

1083
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,060
 David ran and stood over him.

1084
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,940
 He took hold of the Philistine sword

1085
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,220
 and drew it from the sheath.

1086
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,380
 After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword.

1087
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,280
 Good night, kids.

1088
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,900
 When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead,

1089
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,660
 they turned and ran.

1090
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,260
 When the men of Israel and Judah surged forward

1091
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,860
 with a shout and pursued the Philistines

1092
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,460
 to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron,

1093
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,900
 the dead were strewn along the Shurim road

1094
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,600
 to Gath and Ekron.

1095
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,140
 Don't you see what's happening, friends?

1096
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,340
 This story is about a man

1097
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,460
 who fought on behalf of his people.

1098
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:27,300
 It's Goliath, the champion, the man who goes between,

1099
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,980
 says, "Hey, I will fight on behalf of my army

1100
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,740
 "and a type of Christ."

1101
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,660
 David, the shepherd, shows up,

1102
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,960
 someone who's from his lineage.

1103
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,940
 Jesus is gonna show up on the scene.

1104
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,200
 David steps up and says,

1105
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,780
 "Oh, you want to represent all things evil.

1106
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,920
 "I'll represent all things God,

1107
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,540
 "and you're going down.

1108
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,480
 "I will fight on behalf of God.

1109
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,500
 "I will fight on behalf of his people."

1110
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,900
 And one man defeated evil.

1111
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
 This is Jesus.

1112
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,160
 It's the gospel.

1113
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,100
 Jesus is the champion.

1114
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,440
 Goliath was always the underdog.

1115
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,900
 Goliath was born to die in this battle.

1116
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,620
 It's why he existed.

1117
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,260
 God created him to be defeated in this moment.

1118
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,860
 He was never, he never had a chance because he opposed God.

1119
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,400
 No one will ever have a chance opposing God.

1120
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,820
 No one wins in opposition to God.

1121
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,940
 They do not ever win.

1122
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,060
 The most powerful force in the world

1123
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,580
 will always prevail over that evil.

1124
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,340
 And it happened on the cross about 2,000 years ago

1125
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,340
 when all of the sins, the very sins you felt guilty for

1126
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,340
 over the past 45 minutes went on Jesus Christ,

1127
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,620
 the man who went between,

1128
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,820
 the man who stepped in the gap,

1129
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,100
 and he was crushed for your sake.

1130
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,180
 He was the king.

1131
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,160
 And so today you live by faith in him.

1132
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,460
 You walk by faith in him.

1133
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,300
 I know he died for my sins.

1134
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,900
 I know God raised him from the dead.

1135
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,620
 What do I have to be afraid for?

1136
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,540
 What's the worst thing that could happen to me?

1137
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,380
 Death?

1138
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,960
 No, you get to go through that.

1139
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,600
 It's a paradise.

1140
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,000
 God's kingdom.

1141
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,560
 This is the story of Jesus.

1142
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,060
 This is the story of the gospel.

1143
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,820
 Hebrews 12, two and three says,

1144
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,660
 fixing our eyes on Jesus,

1145
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,380
 the pioneer and perfecter of faith.

1146
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,620
 For the joy set before him endured the cross,

1147
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,620
 scorning its shame,

1148
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,360
 and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

1149
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,420
 Consider him the champion, the one who went between,

1150
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,380
 who endured such opposition from sinners

1151
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,260
 so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

1152
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,980
 And so check this out.

1153
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,680
 We step onto the battlefield with the trophy in our hands,

1154
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,060
 with the crown in our hand.

1155
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,260
 The victory is ours.

1156
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,820
 We fight from a position of victory

1157
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,980
 that the battle over sin has already been won

1158
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,380
 through Jesus Christ.

1159
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,540
 Pornography does not win in your life.

1160
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,660
 That abortion will not get the best of you.

1161
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,780
 Drunkenness does not consume you through the grave.

1162
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,900
 Jesus paid for it.

1163
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,000
 You can stop finding identity in men and relationships.

1164
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,100
 You can stop spending money

1165
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,380
 like you're going to fill that void in your heart.

1166
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,700
 You can stop finding identity in your image,

1167
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,700
 who you know, what you do, where you work, what you drive.

1168
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,980
 It's been paid for.

1169
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,300
 It's been purchased.

1170
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,380
 You live forever with God.

1171
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,420
 You have a go between a man who stood in the gap

1172
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,300
 and fought on your behalf.

1173
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,960
 Let me pray and we'll worship him.

1174
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,720
 (pastor sighing)

1175
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:15,080
 Father, thank you for example of Christ.

1176
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,240
 Would you stir in us a courage

1177
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,180
 that comes from a trusting in you completely,

1178
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,720
 not when there's a gun to our head or a giant in our midst,

1179
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,880
 but when we wake up in the morning,

1180
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,340
 when we go to bed tonight, when we drive home.

1181
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,180
 Help us not to give the enemy our thought life.

1182
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,700
 Help us to take captive our obsessions,

1183
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,440
 the thoughts that circle in our head

1184
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:53,440
 that feed fears and arrogance and false confidence.

1185
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,560
 Father, if you need to take things in our lives

1186
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,720
 that distract us from you

1187
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,920
 so that we would be greater servants of you,

1188
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,640
 so be it.

1189
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,860
 What a scary prayer.

1190
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,440
 What a terrifying idea.

1191
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,540
 But if you need to take relationships,

1192
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,400
 if you need to take money,

1193
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,140
 if you need to take positions,

1194
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,640
 if you need to take things that we trust in instead of you

1195
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,680
 so that we would trust in you, so be it.

1196
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,180
 But God, be merciful.

1197
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,560
 Would you mercifully help us to trust in you completely?

1198
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,520
 Would you become greater, God,

1199
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,400
 so that we might become less?

1200
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,000
 I don't know what you're afraid of, man.

1201
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,100
 I know the only thing you have to be afraid of is God.

1202
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,560
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

1203
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,680
 And that God is crazy about you.

1204
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,040
 He is ridiculously, madly in love with you.

1205
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,720
 I bet the farm on that truth.

1206
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,120
 I bet everything I've gone all in on that truth.

1207
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,080
 I'm asking you to.

1208
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,080
 He's like, what do I gotta do to show you that I love you?

1209
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,840
 You want me to give my son on your behalf?

1210
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,680
 Done.

1211
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
 Done, game over.

1212
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,680
 Died for everything you've done

1213
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,240
 so that you don't have to pay for it.

1214
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,640
 So if you trust in that,

1215
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,160
 you can be with him forever and ever and ever.

1216
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,160
 What do you have to be afraid of?

1217
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,480
 And can I tell you something else?

1218
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
 You're not that good.

1219
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,040
 You're not that good.

1220
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,160
 You don't have what it takes.

1221
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,280
 I'm not trying to beat you up.

1222
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,760
 I'm just saying the things that you trust in, man,

1223
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,960
 they're gonna fail you one day.

1224
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,480
 And if they're the only things you trust in,

1225
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,120
 you're going to face despair and depression and devastation.

1226
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,680
 And I just, I love you guys.

1227
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,840
 I'm just tired of having that conversation.

1228
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,280
 I'm tired of talking to one more rich, young ruler

1229
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,080
 who trusted in all the wrong things.

1230
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,920
 They're handsome and they're beautiful.

1231
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,120
 And they got great degrees and good jobs

1232
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,040
 and they just found themselves

1233
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,320
 where they just can't stop being sad.

1234
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,600
 Like, oh man, I know why you're sad.

1235
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,080
 You trust in the wrong things.

1236
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,800
 You trust in things that are gonna disappoint you.

1237
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,000
 Of course you're sad.

1238
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,760
 But I know someone that's not gonna disappoint you.

1239
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,240
 Someone that's eternally fixed.

1240
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,880
 Someone that is eternally strong.

1241
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,640
 Eternally wise.

1242
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,480
 Someone who loves you.

1243
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,880
 Someone who's numbered your days.

1244
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,360
 Someone who's always gonna be with you.

1245
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,440
 Someone who's never gonna disappoint you.

1246
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,280
 That when you find yourself all alone,

1247
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,560
 you're not alone, they're with you.

1248
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,120
 Someone you can trust in completely.

1249
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,400
 Someone, the only one, who can carry you through the grave

1250
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,640
 from death to life, into eternity, into paradise,

1251
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,840
 into his kingdom forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

1252
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,080
 and you're not going to be the first one

1253
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,200
 in the history of history to pursue the world and get it.

1254
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,960
 And what does it forfeit a man to gain the whole world

1255
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,200
 yet forfeit his soul?

1256
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:06,320
 What does it give a man or a woman to do that?

1257
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,440
 Don't be crazy.

1258
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,280
 Pursue Christ.

1259
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,760
 He's enough.

1260
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,600
 He's yours.

1261
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:24,600
