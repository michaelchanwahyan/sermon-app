[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.580]   How we doing?
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.440]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920]   Hey, we gotta settle this right up top, okay?
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.360]   Gotta get this out of the way, man.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.500]   All right?
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160]   Just straight up, not playing games.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.680]   Just before we dive into the message,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.560]   before we get to the truth,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.600]   I wanna know what you hear.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   Laurel.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   Laurel.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.080]   Laurel.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.600]   Laurel.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.440]   Laurel.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   All right, how many hear Laurel?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.360]   All right, all right, all right, good representation.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.280]   Okay, how many are wrong?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.540]   How many hear Yanny?
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.780]   How many, oh, you're timid, you're timid.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.840]   Some of you, oh, some of you are like,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.200]   I heard Laurel that time.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.560]   That's because there's people around
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680]   and you're sane, okay?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.720]   I know what's going on.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   You're like, yeah.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   Man, what kind of witchcraft is that?
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.440]   Some sort of crazy spiritual warfare.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.320]   Enemies working in madness.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.760]   It reminds, you know it reminds everybody,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640]   it's been said over and over, the dress.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.440]   You guys remember the dress, right?
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.240]   What do you see?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080]   What do you see?
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.420]   Whose team, whose team white and gold?
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080]   Whose team white and gold?
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.240]   All right, whose team wrong?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.720]   Blue and black.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.920]   That's crazy talk.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   I don't even see anything that can remotely
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.220]   look like blue and black up there.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.780]   White sleeves, pretty gold lace.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.480]   But it's crazy, but okay, come with me, come with me.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   Hey, check this out.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.160]   And so you see something, you hear something,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.040]   you feel something, and then there's a reality, right?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.400]   Like no matter what we think we heard,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   it's the guy who recorded it on vocabulary.com said Laurel.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.020]   You might hear Yanny, but what he said was Laurel,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.940]   and we know that because we can go to the source.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.240]   There's a truth, there's a reality,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.080]   there's something that's fixed.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.560]   No matter what you hear, no matter what you see,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.680]   no matter how deeply you feel.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.900]   I look at that dress, no matter what you say,
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.520]   I see white and gold.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.720]   I can know, I know, sister, I feel you.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.800]   And I can't, there's nothing, I just don't get it.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.260]   You're like, no, it's blue and black.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.540]   I'm like, no, you're so wrong.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.780]   But you know what?
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.840]   We can go to the source, the one who made the dress,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.240]   and we see that.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.320]   And he clearly says, hey, it's blue,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.440]   there I see blue and black, that's blue and black.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.760]   That other one's white and gold, though.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.480]   And so, but you know, but I'm wrong.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.580]   No matter what I think I see, no matter what I hear,
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.560]   no matter what I feel, there's a truth.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.920]   And the way that you know the truth
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.880]   is that you go to the originator, the creator,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.920]   the one who made the dress, the one who spoke the word,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.480]   and they get to determine.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   And the same is true in our world,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.440]   where in this series, The Remnant,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.120]   David talked about last week how God preserves the people
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840]   to preserve the world.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.960]   Here's the reality, God has always had his people.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.680]   There are, at any time in history since creation,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.920]   there have been God followers.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.760]   Sometimes many, sometimes few, once only two.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.800]   But God has always had a people that he's preserved,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   that he's called to himself.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.160]   My prayer is that now, or at least by the end
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.120]   of this message, that you would be one of them,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.720]   that we would get to spend forever in eternity together,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.180]   and you would leave here with the certainty
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.640]   that you're going to be there.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.600]   And so tonight, I wanna talk about
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.480]   how The Remnant knows the truth,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.960]   how the ones that God has preserved and chosen for himself
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.000]   and called to know him, they have a reality.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.900]   They understand the purpose for which they live.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.640]   They know why the world was created,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   and why God created you, and the plans that he has for you,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.460]   these incredible plans that the creator has for you.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.280]   You can navigate this world
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   like your atheist friend can't.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.680]   You can navigate this world
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.440]   like your unbelieving friend can't,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   or like your friend who's pursuing a false god can't,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.840]   because if there's a true God, then there's a false God,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.800]   or lots of false gods.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.160]   And I need you to know something.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   It's okay to know that, to say that,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   to believe that, regardless of the ridicule you face,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.440]   the accusations that come against you.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.120]   It's not a popular idea in our day
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.440]   to say that there's absolute truth.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.320]   People believe that it's arrogant,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.840]   that you would say, hey, I know what's right,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.960]   and if I know what's right,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.240]   that means that something is wrong.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.000]   And so this is crazy, though.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.040]   Like, if you see a loved one,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   someone you care about deeply,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.760]   and they're walking along a ledge,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   and they're about to fall off,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.240]   and you run to go and catch them,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.840]   and they say, no, no, it's okay, I think I'm a bird.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.320]   You're gonna say, no, bird, you're about to feel gravity.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.080]   The reality of gravity, you wouldn't say,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.320]   oh, you think you're a bird, well, then you must be.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   You wouldn't do that.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.920]   Why wouldn't you do that?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.520]   'Cause you're not crazy, and because you love them.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.720]   You're gonna grab them, and you're gonna pull them back.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.780]   You can say, no, I don't want you to die.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.680]   I don't want you, you're not a bird.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.880]   You're on LSD or something.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.840]   No, you can't do that, you won't fly.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.760]   That's not going to go well for you.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.880]   And I believe this is the most dangerous problem
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.800]   in our generation.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.820]   I believe that we are being brainwashed,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.840]   and it's the watering down of truth,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.560]   and calling it loving.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.540]   And if what you're saying is not true,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.760]   then it's not loving.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.700]   And if what you're believing is not true,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.140]   then it's disastrous.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.540]   It's destructive.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.500]   It is going to be detrimental, not only to your health,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.380]   but to your life.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.760]   It's disastrous, it's dangerous.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.020]   So how do we know what that sound is?
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.340]   How do we know what color the dress is?
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.420]   We go to the source, and the source is able to tell us,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.940]   regardless of how we feel.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.260]   This is what I want to return to
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.580]   over and over again tonight,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.900]   that it's not your feelings that determine truth.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.700]   If you can believe that, friends,
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.020]   then you're going to leave here,
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.820]   and I, the Holy Spirit, through the word,
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.240]   is going to spare you a lot of heartache,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.780]   that your feelings don't determine reality.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.500]   The way I feel does not determine what is real.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.940]   The way I feel does not determine what is real.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.380]   Can you guys say that with me?
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.100]   I'm gonna say it, and I'd love for you to repeat that,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.620]   just so you can just kind of sense what it feels like
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.060]   for those words to come out of your mouth.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.460]   The way I feel does not determine what is real.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.340]   I want you to hold onto that
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.820]   as we dive into the Scriptures.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.500]   We're gonna be in John chapter eight,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.040]   and we're gonna look at how the truth will set you free,
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.420]   how Satan deceives to make you a slave,
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.940]   and how the remnant are God's relatives.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.220]   Before you leave here tonight,
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.720]   how we're gonna look at the reality
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.980]   that we can be children of God.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.100]   It's John chapter eight, verse 31.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.580]   Jesus is talking to the Jews.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.900]   The Pharisees are there.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.820]   Jesus is saying, hey, I'm the son of God.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.660]   I know God.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.620]   I've been with God in eternity past.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.260]   I know how to get to God.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.420]   I am the truth.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.220]   They're saying, no, you're a liar.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.540]   Jesus is saying, no, you believed a liar.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.300]   There were some people there who started to believe him.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.820]   As Jesus is preaching, they begin to convert.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.700]   The Holy Spirit comes into their life.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.100]   They begin to understand who he is.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.700]   He says this, "To the Jews who had believed him,
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.860]   "Jesus said, if you hold to my teaching,
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.500]   "you are really my disciples.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.020]   "Then you will know the truth
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.940]   "and the truth will set you free."
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.060]   He says, hey, if you hold to my teachings,
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.140]   you're my followers, you're my disciples.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.620]   You will know the truth and then you will be free.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.940]   My followers, they follow me.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.220]   And as you test my teaching, he's saying this,
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.600]   hey, test it.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.340]   Like take the things that I've said
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.060]   that this is how you find life.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.860]   Follow it and see if you find life there.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.660]   See if you find freedom there.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.980]   And as you continue to find freedom there,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.460]   you're gonna know the truth.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.380]   It's gonna be affirmed in you.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.820]   And I've experienced this, both in my own life,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.520]   but moreover in the lives of hundreds of you guys.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.340]   Over the past 10 years, I've met with hundreds
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.620]   and hundreds of you and can I just tell you
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.500]   the conversation I've never had.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.100]   I've never talked with the one who's faithfully,
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.140]   radically followed Jesus through college
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.160]   and they come and they say, you know what, man?
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.840]   I just, I just wish I would've drank more, man.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.120]   Like heroin kind of sounds awesome and I just,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.360]   I'm bummed I missed out on that and you know,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.500]   and I wish I had more sexual partners.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.320]   That's really what I wish, I've never heard that.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.200]   I've never heard, you know, I've always wondered
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.560]   what it's like to hug a toilet in a strip club and vomit.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.860]   I just, I've always kind of, I always kind of feel
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.320]   like I missed out on that experience.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.700]   No one's ever said that.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.840]   But friends, can I tell you what I've heard
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.000]   over and over and over?
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.100]   JP, man, bro, I gotta tell my fiancee
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.780]   I've got, had 16 sexual partners.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.740]   How do I do that?
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.540]   How do I tell her I've been with 16 people?
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.080]   How do I tell her this is my past?
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.640]   JP, man, I had an abortion, I had two, I had four.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.620]   JP, I funded an abortion, man, I regret that.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.980]   I wish that wasn't a part of my story.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.660]   JP, I drank so much, I don't even remember what happened.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.220]   JP, what if, what if, I mean, I think we had sex,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   I don't know, what if, what if she comes back
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.340]   15 years from now and says I raped her?
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.460]   I gotta live with that, bro, I'm scared.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.900]   That ain't freedom, man.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.420]   There's no freedom in that.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.860]   Does that sound like freedom?
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.220]   Jesus is saying, hey, test me, man.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.800]   You've tried it your way, would you try it my way?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.940]   You're gonna experience freedom
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.460]   and you're gonna know the truth
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.420]   and that truth is gonna lead to freedom.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.700]   See, this truth, and it operates like a key,
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.560]   it lets you out of the cage of sin.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.420]   That's my first point, the truth will set you free.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.260]   Knowing truth is knowing freedom.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.660]   What does it mean that the truth is going to set you free?
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.500]   That you are captive to the truth you believe.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.220]   Here's what it means.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.460]   Your belief is always going to determine your behavior.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.460]   What you believe is always going to determine what you do.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.420]   Whom you trust in is going to determine who you follow.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.100]   Your belief is always going to determine how you behave.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.580]   If I wanna know what you believe,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.220]   I can look at your behavior and I can say,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.220]   well, that's what you believe.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.700]   You believe there's life there.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.140]   You believe there's life in the party.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.340]   You believe there's life in drinking.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.620]   You believe there's life in finding identity
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.860]   in relationships because that's what you do.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.140]   And you're like, no, I don't believe that,
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.180]   I just slipped up.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.740]   No, you believe the lie.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.420]   You believe the lie.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   You believe the lie.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.340]   If you hold to my teaching, his teaching's in the Bible,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.060]   we're gonna spend a whole week on the Bible.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.900]   So if you're wondering,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.100]   why doesn't he go more into the Bible tonight?
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.540]   We're gonna spend a week there.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.540]   If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciple.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.580]   Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.740]   Freedom comes from knowing and knowing leads to following.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.020]   Does what we believe determine our behavior?
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.580]   My daughter came home from school the other day
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.860]   and she said, Daddy, we talked about heaven.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.140]   Dad said, oh yeah, what did that look like?
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.060]   She said, well, one of my friends believes
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.380]   that whenever you die,
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.500]   that everyone who dies becomes a squirrel.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.580]   Silly, isn't it?
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.500]   And you just think about that.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.780]   And I said, well, where does that come from?
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.100]   Like, that's a cool belief, like neat, okay,
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.460]   everybody becomes a squirrel, there's lots of them around.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.500]   But that's really gonna impact how you treat squirrels.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.060]   Like, if it could be great-great-grandmother
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.740]   or great-great-grandfather, right, you're swerving
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.100]   to miss 'em and you're feeding 'em out back
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.780]   'cause they may be a relative, you know?
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.660]   And as you laugh, you gotta keep in mind,
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.820]   there's an entire world religion
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.060]   that embraces this idea of reincarnation.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.300]   And it's why they don't kill rats,
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.180]   but treat them with respect because they may be relatives.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.180]   That's the truth.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.220]   Then you say, well, that's funny.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.620]   You're giggling, you're laughing.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.780]   It's not any more funny than saying,
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.480]   I believe everyone goes to heaven.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.060]   Cool, you believe, I wanna believe that.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.100]   Where does it come from?
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.020]   Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.120]   Do you believe that because it feels good?
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.300]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, your feelings
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.360]   get to determine what is reality.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.880]   I don't believe there's a hell.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.600]   Cool!
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.700]   Where did that come from?
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:48.260]   What divine revelation did you have
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.460]   that showed you, what book did you read?
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.180]   Like, where did you go to school
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.860]   where the professor said, hey, sit down
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.100]   because I got something I wanna break off for you?
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.660]   There's no such thing as hell.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.740]   I can prove it.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.300]   Where did that belief come from?
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.820]   And if you were honest, you were like,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.860]   well, I just, you know, I was kinda thinking about it
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.580]   and I just kinda feel like, would God really send?
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.600]   I don't know, did he say he would?
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.500]   What's your source of truth?
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.420]   You have to know what you believe
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.940]   and you have to know why you believe it.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.920]   What do you believe?
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.380]   And why do you believe it?
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.420]   And as you believe that, that's going to have
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.540]   tremendous impact on how you act.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.820]   Is that true, right?
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.860]   Is that true?
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.340]   The reason that you look at porn,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.180]   the reason you buy things you can't afford,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.260]   the reason you have sex outside of marriage,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.740]   the reason you get drunk is because you think
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.140]   it will bring life and you trust your feelings
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.180]   over God's instruction.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.300]   And so let's test it.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.760]   Does your belief determine your behavior?
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.000]   Let me just ask you a few questions.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.600]   We'll do a little quiz here.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.060]   Did anyone ever wait 30 minutes to swim after you ate?
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.000]   Anybody ever do that?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.960]   I did, like just hoot or raise your hand or something.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.800]   Yeah, so did anyone ever avoid Coke or chocolate
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.420]   because it causes acne?
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.640]   So like prom, hey, don't wanna eat chocolate,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.720]   don't wanna break out.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.360]   Did anyone ever, you know, you don't wanna,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.960]   you wanna get dressed before you go outside
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.920]   when it's really cold because you don't wanna catch a cold
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.560]   so you put on a beanie or a hat.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.700]   Your mom's like, hey, put on your shoes,
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.540]   you don't wanna catch a cold.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.720]   So you go put on your shoes because it's cold outside.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.240]   Anybody ever do that?
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.080]   Dress warm?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.280]   Has anyone ever backed up from the TV
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.780]   so it wouldn't hurt your eyes?
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.280]   Your parents walk in, hey, scoot back,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.240]   you don't wanna go blind.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.160]   Did anyone ever not swallow gum because you didn't want it
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.960]   to stay in your stomach for seven years?
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.540]   You're like, dude, I don't want a big old gumball in there,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.560]   not gonna do it, not happening.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.840]   Did anyone ever avoid shaving something
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.160]   because it would come back darker and thicker,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.800]   like your eyebrows right here?
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.120]   You're like, I don't want a unibrow
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   for the rest of my life.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   I love your boldness to raise your hand.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.240]   Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.060]   And so here's the deal, all of those are myths.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.540]   Oh, no, all that time wasted that you could've been swimming
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.400]   right after you ate, you wouldn't get a cramp.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.160]   You don't catch a cold from being cold.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.540]   Catch a cold from the bug, you know,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.340]   it transfers from one person to another, it's contagious.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.240]   TV won't hurt your eyes.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.580]   Except that shaving thing, that's true,
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.460]   so I'm sorry for that.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.540]   No, I'm kidding, it's not true.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.220]   No, that's not true either, right?
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.040]   But all of that, that belief impacted the way we behave.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.240]   That's why those myths have came into reality,
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.260]   that someone would try to impact what you would do
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.620]   and so they would breathe into, hey,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.860]   I don't want you to swim right after you eat.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.760]   So you need to sit out for 30 minutes.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.780]   And so you sat there sitting out for 30 minutes
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.380]   based on a belief, but it wasn't grounded in truth.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.500]   And those are pretty innocent.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.520]   But this is where I think the church has missed
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.580]   in a really bad way.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.800]   Because when someone's being bad, we sit them down
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.100]   and we talk to them about how they're behaving.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.280]   You know, why are you looking at pornography?
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.440]   Why are you living with him?
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.300]   Why are you getting drunk?
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.160]   You need to stop doing that, stop being bad.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.400]   No, no, no, no, no, you're believing a lie
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.780]   that's harmful to you, that God, the creator
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.480]   of the heavens and the earth has given you instruction
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.600]   not to rip you off, to set you free,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.160]   and what you're doing is actually going to hurt you
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.760]   and you're believing that life is there
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.600]   but life is not found there.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.660]   You're believing a lie.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.420]   Let's strip it back and understand
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.380]   what lie you're believing.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.560]   First John 1:16 says, "If we claim to have fellowship
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.520]   "with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.760]   "and do not live out the truth."
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.640]   It's a really simple verse.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.040]   If you claim to be a Christ follower
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.000]   but you're not following Jesus, you should ask,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.140]   am I really a Christ follower?
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.840]   Like if I say, hey, I follow Jesus,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.680]   but I don't follow Jesus, I should ask,
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.480]   do I really follow Jesus?
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.680]   It's just kind of common sense.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.720]   Where are you at?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.240]   Are you a Christ follower?
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.120]   And so just imagine now before we move on in the text,
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.120]   imagine if we actually lived what we said we believed.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.680]   Like imagine if we read this book
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.120]   and we just said, okay, this is true.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.720]   So one, I believe that this is God's word
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.120]   and instruction for living life,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.640]   suitable for correcting, rebuking,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.560]   and training in righteousness.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.400]   And you know what?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.960]   I believe that I can talk to the creator
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.120]   of the heavens and the earth and he listens to me.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.080]   And so, right, I can pray.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   Wouldn't you pray all the time if you believed
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.560]   that you could talk to the creator?
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.960]   Like wouldn't you spend so much time praying?
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.920]   And if you believe that sex outside of marriage
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.240]   wasn't just a bad idea,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.520]   but it's literally killing your marriage
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.320]   long before you even have a prospect,
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   wouldn't you say, okay, I don't wanna do that?
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.440]   And if you believe that getting drunk
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.600]   wasn't just like God was trying to keep you from it,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.520]   but he's trying to save you from addiction
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.960]   and poverty and hurt and being an alcoholic later
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.660]   and having your children hate you.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.580]   Imagine if we believe that people
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.900]   were actually going to hell
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.500]   and that the way they didn't go to hell
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.420]   is by us sharing Jesus with them.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.500]   How many people would we share Christ with
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.220]   if we really believed that truth?
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.380]   Like what if we just believed this was true?
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.060]   How would that impact your life?
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.540]   The remnant knows the truth.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.060]   And the truth is a person.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.620]   The remnant knows the truth
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.340]   and the truth is a person.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.220]   They answered Jesus.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.660]   We are Abraham's descendants
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.420]   and we have never been slaves of anyone.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.700]   How can you say that we shall be set free?
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.140]   Jesus says, then you will know the truth,
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.980]   you shall be free.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.100]   They say free, free from what?
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.440]   We're free.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.420]   That's the hardest person to share the gospel with
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.300]   is the person that says, hey, I don't need Jesus.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.980]   You're telling me Jesus is gonna make my life better.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.380]   My life is fine, no thanks.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.380]   You're like, hey, eternal life.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.940]   I don't need eternal life, I need tomorrow.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.860]   I need the party this weekend, no thanks.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.540]   Jesus replied, very truly, I tell you,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.820]   everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.640]   Now a slave has no permanent place in the family,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.980]   but a son belongs to it forever.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.420]   So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.300]   I know that you are Abraham's descendants,
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.500]   yet you are looking for a way to kill me.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.660]   Because you have no room for my word,
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.180]   I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.300]   and you are doing what you have heard from your father.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.200]   When he says your father, he's talking about Satan.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.460]   They say, no, Abraham is our father.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.460]   He says, no, if Abraham was your father,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.740]   you'd do what Abraham did, but no, you're trying to kill me.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.460]   You're not like Abraham.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.660]   You're doing the works of your own father, the devil.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.500]   And he says, we're not a legitimate trinity.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.660]   He says, they say the only father we have is God himself.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.060]   Jesus said to them, if God were your father,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.820]   you would love me, for I have come here from God.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.180]   I have not come on my own, God sent me.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.500]   Why is my language not clear to you?
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.780]   Because you are unable to hear what I say.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.380]   You belong to your father, the devil.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.900]   He's not pulling any punches now.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.740]   You belong to your father, the devil,
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.180]   and you wanna carry out your father's desires.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.320]   He was a murderer from the beginning,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.020]   not holding to the truth, but there is no truth in him.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.260]   When he lies, he speaks his native language,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.680]   for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.300]   Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.060]   Sin is simply believing a lie.
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.300]   And we see the clear, the enemy's clear strategy to get you.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.400]   There's an enemy, there's Satan, he hates you.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.460]   All of the dreams that God has for you,
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.860]   he desires to destroy.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.340]   He wants you stuck in sin, slave to sin,
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.500]   amounting to nothing, wasting your life,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.560]   living maybe the little American dream and dying,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.020]   a meaningless, purposeless life.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.260]   My second point, Satan desires to make you a slave.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.660]   Every one of us is most likely being deceived
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.020]   by Satan right now in some way that's really unsettling.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.420]   And so I've always wondered how Satan works,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.260]   like what can he do?
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.060]   Like for example, like spiritual warfare.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.140]   Like if I'm gonna go share the gospel with a guy
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.660]   and I turn the key to my truck and it doesn't start,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.960]   the battery's dead, and I'm like, oh, spiritual warfare.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.540]   Did Satan like drain my battery?
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.420]   Like what did he do, what are his capabilities?
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.420]   Did he get in there and mess with my alternator?
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.740]   What can he do, right?
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.680]   Fair question.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.460]   Here's what he can do.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.720]   He's got a strategy, it's a really simple one.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.940]   He can try to get you to believe his lies.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.020]   And it's really hard because when you're believing his lies,
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.840]   you can't see it.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.020]   And people who love you can come around you and say,
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.940]   hey, he's not any good for you, but you're like,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.060]   but I love him.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:49.260]   And they can say, hey, you shouldn't do that.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.940]   And you're like, but it's fun.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.760]   And I think God would want me to have fun.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.160]   And you begin to justify your sin.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.680]   Jesus replied, very truly, I tell you,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.240]   everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.920]   In verse 44, the devil was a murderer from the beginning,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.320]   not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.100]   When he lies, he speaks his native language,
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.560]   for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.920]   Migue, I liken it to like when the Nazis were trying
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.040]   to get the Jews into a concentration camp,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.120]   they didn't say, hey, jump on the train
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.900]   'cause we're gonna take you to a concentration camp
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.200]   and kill you, right?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.080]   They would have risked their lives
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.120]   to not get on that train.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.880]   What they said is, hey, we're going to labor camps.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   You can come here, it may not be pleasant,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.160]   but at least you'll have a job.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.880]   Get on the train, get on the train.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.640]   They take him to the train, they get off the train,
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.800]   say, hey, go in there and take a shower.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.040]   We want you to get clean.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.740]   It's a gas chamber, and they gas them and they kill them.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.480]   How did they get them in the gas chamber?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.440]   They lied.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.140]   That's what Satan's doing to you, he's lying.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.160]   But it's different from that illustration
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.440]   because he'll actually get us to defend our lie,
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.500]   to love our lie so much that we begin to defend it.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.660]   No, but I want to, but no, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.440]   It's like art, it's a beautiful creature,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.360]   and I don't know, is masturbation really a sin?
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.700]   And if God didn't want me to do this,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.440]   why would he give me these desires?
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.720]   And that's called justification.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.920]   But we're married in God's eyes.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.820]   What is marriage anyways, really?
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:21.080]   And you will defend your sin,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.520]   cohabitate with the enemy,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.720]   as they keep lying to me,
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.660]   'cause I enjoy your lies more than the truth.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.060]   In this world, you're the prince of this world, Satan,
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.160]   and it's easier to live this world under the guise of lies
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.320]   than to be one of the narrow ones who follow the truth
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.440]   on the narrow path.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.760]   It's so much easier to believe the lies.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.720]   I don't want to be weird, I don't want to be a Jesus freak,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.200]   I don't want to be radical for my faith.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   In 1973, there was a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:04.840]   and they took four hostages captive.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.560]   And they beat them and abused them,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.840]   and they were ultimately rescued,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.880]   but something really interesting happened.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.640]   The hostages wouldn't testify against
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.040]   those who held them captive.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.920]   There was some weird bond that was created between them,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.120]   and they defended them.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.140]   And that was birthed a phrase called Stockholm syndrome.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.440]   Stockholm syndrome, I'll read you the definition.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:38.360]   Defined as strong emotional ties
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.080]   that develop between two persons
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   when one person intimately harasses, beats,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.000]   threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.280]   I'll give you another modern example of Stockholm syndrome.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.120]   Often when girls are trafficked into the sex trade
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.760]   and made sex slaves, they're beaten, abused,
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.840]   they're fed drugs, they're raped for profit on the daily,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.440]   sometimes urinated on, and just terrible things,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.040]   unspeakable things, and when they go to be rescued,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.240]   a lot of times they will reject the rescuer
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.960]   and say, hey, I want to stay with my pimp.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.520]   It's called Stockholm syndrome.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.660]   And you say, well, that's crazy.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.040]   I know what you're thinking right now.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.560]   You're like, man, that's crazy, I would never do that.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.860]   You do that every day.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.400]   Jesus shows up and says, hey, I want to pull you
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.960]   out of the club, I want to pull you out of that life.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.240]   I have a better life, I want to pull you
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.080]   out of that relationship, I want to pull you away
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.120]   from that website, away from that hashtag,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.680]   away from that social media, away from that debt,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.640]   away from that buying, away from that coping.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.920]   I have something better, and you look at him
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.460]   and you say, Jesus, no thank you.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.680]   I love my sin more than you.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.700]   Jesus, I want to stay here with Jesus.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.540]   Would you just leave me alone in this season?
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.280]   Maybe you and I will get right in another season,
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.480]   but right now I'd like to keep doing this.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.940]   I love my sin too much.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.480]   Stockholm syndrome, you're a slave.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.620]   You're a slave to sin.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.500]   You've been deceived by the enemy.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.140]   You've believed his lies, and I'm trying
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.420]   to wake you up right now.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.780]   We fall too deeply in love with our sin
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.400]   that when Jesus offers us freedom, we say no thank you.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.580]   And consider your sins that we'd willingly
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.880]   walk into the trap of pornography or drinking.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.720]   We begin to justify, well, Jesus drank,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.200]   yeah, not shots of tequila.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.560]   It's this weird thing that you wanted
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.200]   the freedom to do something that now you can't stop doing.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.840]   I wanted the freedom to look at that image,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   but now I can't stop chasing those images.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.040]   It keeps showing up every month or every week
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.920]   or every other month.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.040]   I go back like a dog to his vomit,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.440]   to this thing that's destroying me.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.260]   What's wrong with me?
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.320]   Who will save me from this body of death?
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.680]   You can stay with me for just a moment.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.500]   It's very prominent in our culture.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.240]   There's this weird thing, the gender wars,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.700]   that's going on on our time.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.240]   If I was born a man and I feel like a woman,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.520]   then my emotional intelligence determines my gender.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.420]   It's no longer binary, right?
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.320]   Here's the problem.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.360]   There's several problems with that.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.020]   Let me give you a few just to think on.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.040]   Okay, let's say someone was killed.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.880]   We find the body and we're trying to identify the body.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.080]   The first question we're gonna ask,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.260]   well, is the body male or female?
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.100]   I don't know, they're dead,
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.600]   so I can't see their emotional intelligence.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.800]   I don't know how they feel.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.000]   I don't know if they felt like a man
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.960]   or if they felt like a woman.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.780]   I don't know.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.560]   In my effort to explain this to you,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.960]   and this is where it gets tricky,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.300]   see, some of you are turning me off right now.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.820]   You're like, hey, you're marginalizing the transgender.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.160]   No, I'm not, I love the transgender.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.000]   What, you need a home?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.880]   You got one, I'll give you one.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.720]   You need some money?
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.540]   You can have mine.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.380]   You need a meal?
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.160]   Sit down with my family and eat at our table.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.740]   I love you.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.920]   I don't hate you.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.140]   Okay?
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.920]   We can say, hey, we can talk about same-sex attraction.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.300]   Say, hey, you were born that way.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.200]   I'm not here to argue that you were born that way.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.440]   Do you know how I was born?
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.120]   Do you know how messed up and depraved that I was born?
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.920]   Born a polygamist,
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.740]   not able to be satisfied by a single woman.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.360]   Oh, a heterosexual pervert.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.260]   That's who's talking to you right now.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.280]   Like, let me just ask you a question.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.480]   Let me ask you a question by show of hands.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.840]   How many of you would say you were a Christian in college?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.000]   Like, if I would've met you in college,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.080]   you would've said, hey, I'm a Christian.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.240]   Just raise your hand if you were a Christian in college.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.080]   Okay?
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:39.900]   A lot of you.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.000]   A lot of you who would say you're a Christian in college.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.800]   Okay, now, don't raise your hand on this one.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.720]   I just want you to think about it.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.840]   How many of you did something sexually
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.880]   that you knew would dishonor God in college?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   You don't have to raise your hand.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.680]   Just think, okay, I know I did, right?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.080]   I did something that I knew dishonored God.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.980]   Well, what did you do?
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.760]   You rejected the truth.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.160]   You believed a lie,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   even though you called yourself a Christian.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.920]   And the most loving thing that I could do
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.360]   in that circumstance is to intersect and say,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.400]   hey, God loves you.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.640]   This is not who you are.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.580]   This is not his best for you.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.200]   He has something better for you.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.640]   And your sin is no different
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.440]   than any of the other sins I just said.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.940]   It's also where the church has missed it,
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.160]   where it's gone and made some kind of sexual,
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.400]   or some kind of special categories for some sins.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.900]   No.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.180]   All of our sexual sin goes into the same bucket.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.020]   We're all messed up.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.040]   We all need a Savior.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.060]   Praise God we have one.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.360]   The remnant knows the truth.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.660]   The truth is a person.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.940]   His name is Jesus.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.980]   His name is Jesus.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.640]   This is Romans one, verse 25.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.300]   It says, "They exchange the truth of God for a lie."
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.560]   Go and read Romans one later.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.420]   There's a homework assignment for you.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.980]   The truth will always sound like hate
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.520]   to those who hate the truth.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.440]   And a lie will always sound loving to those who live a lie.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.220]   But the problem with living a lie, friends,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.920]   is it's not who you are.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.560]   It's not who you are.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.400]   Now listen to me.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.960]   The third point from this text
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.680]   is the remnant are God's relatives.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.140]   This is a beautiful truth straight from this text.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.360]   The remnant are God's relatives.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.200]   Now a slave has no permanent place in the family,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.380]   but a son belongs to it forever.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.340]   So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.960]   See, the slave, a slave is an employee.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.240]   A slave comes and goes.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.800]   A slave is at convenience.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.080]   But a son, there's nothing that son can do
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.600]   to not be a part of the family.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.680]   And who makes you a son to God most high,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.280]   the creator of the heavens and the earth
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.320]   is his own son, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.920]   adopting you into his family by his death and resurrection
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.560]   for the forgiveness of your sins
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.260]   so that you might be adopted sons and daughters.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.720]   This is the beautiful truth of this verse.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.920]   And so the world that you exist in, here's the truth, ready?
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.680]   The world that you exist in, it was created by God.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.600]   He made humanity in his image.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.680]   He designed them beautifully to function
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.800]   in a particular way.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.040]   He made their parts and he made the parts
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.840]   to fit with the other parts the way they do.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.920]   He invented sex.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.680]   He made it feel the way that he does.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.200]   It was his idea.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.040]   He has a design to it.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.640]   It's just, it's brilliant.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.520]   It's mind-blowingly brilliant.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.760]   And he created the earth.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.080]   And it was lost to our sin,
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.720]   but he's gonna come back and repair it, make it perfect,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   and create a place for you to live forever
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.660]   and ever and ever, that when you die,
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.480]   you can live with God forever.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.920]   Or you can live separated from him forever.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.680]   And that's the reality that you live in.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.720]   And if you embrace that truth every day,
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.680]   you renew your mind around that truth,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.480]   you better believe it's going to impact how you live.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.640]   And God loves you so much,
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.200]   you have the freedom to do anything in this world,
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   anything that you want, and glorify him except sin.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.520]   Did you know that, that anything that you do
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.820]   other than sin glorifies the Father?
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.360]   He looks down at you, or he looks at you,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.120]   and he is pleased, he finds great joy
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.520]   in the way that you work and in the way that you play
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.420]   and the things that you do except sin.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.240]   Because he's truth.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.720]   And no loving parent wants to watch
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.240]   their children believe a lie.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.440]   And he designed the world, he's the source,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.300]   he's the creator, the originator.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.280]   And he gets to determine the way that life should be lived
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.860]   so that you might experience it to the fullest.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.840]   And if you're here and you're the remnant,
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   you're the only ones who know the truth.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.200]   And the truth is that Christ sets you free from sin.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.240]   That immediately upon trusting in Christ,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.280]   he sets you free from the penalty of sin.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.860]   You don't have to go to hell,
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.600]   you get to be with God forever.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.800]   And as you continue to walk in him and know the truth,
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.460]   he sets you free from the power of sin
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.160]   that one day, like a dog to his vomit,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.680]   you continue to return to sin,
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.320]   but as you trust in Jesus, you begin to,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.160]   as you trust in his spirit, be able to resist sin.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.520]   And one day, friends, he's going to set you free
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.840]   from the presence of sin,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.460]   that you will be somewhere with him in his presence
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.040]   where nothing remotely will remind you of sin, praise God.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.800]   And so you follow him, even if,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.000]   and I need you to hear this, this is really important,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.360]   even if, and I'm talking to you,
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.800]   in fact, close your eyes for just a minute
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.280]   so you can hear this, like I'm talking to you,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.580]   I'm talking straight to you,
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.940]   even if you're the only one,
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.940]   even if you're the only one on the planet Earth,
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.980]   you follow him.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   If the entire world says he's not the way,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.780]   you say, I believe he is the way,
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.280]   and I'm going to follow him.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.620]   It's like Noah.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.540]   Noah was the only one, right?
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.380]   He built the ark.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.220]   They said he was crazy.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.040]   It hadn't even rained.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.300]   He's building a boat in the middle of nowhere.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.260]   You be like Noah.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.980]   You say, God told me to build a boat.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.080]   I'm building a boat.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.740]   I'll spend decades and decades and decades of my life.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.580]   You believe that a man died for your sins
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.560]   and rose from the dead and that you get to live forever.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.280]   The remnant knows the truth and his name is Jesus.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.580]   And friends, listen, something can be true.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.420]   I want you to listen.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.240]   You can look at me now.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   Something can be true, even if no one knows it.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   Something can be true, even if no one admits it.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:36.260]   Something can be true, even if no one agrees what it is.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.220]   Something can be true,
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.980]   even if no one on the earth follows it.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.520]   And something can be true,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.200]   even if no one but God grasps it fully.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.020]   It comes from a book, "True for You, But Not for Me."
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.500]   And so you belong to Jesus.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.460]   That's your reality.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.960]   It's a beautiful reality.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.300]   You get to be brothers and sisters to Christ.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.380]   I think David told you last week
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.980]   that two weeks ago we were in London.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:16.040]   One night, it was late, about 11 p.m. there,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.460]   and we were walking back to our hotel
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.100]   and we passed this homeless couple
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.480]   and they were in bad shape.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.780]   Almost looked like they were playing a homeless couple
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.540]   in a movie, really thin.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   He had red hair and she was a brunette
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.180]   and they were there on the side of the street
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.500]   and they were begging everyone that came by,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.340]   could you have any change?
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.540]   In this thick English accent,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.420]   do you have any change, do you have any change?
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.540]   I walked by and said, I don't have any change.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.060]   The Holy Spirit convicted us.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.220]   We said, why don't we go back?
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.680]   And we went back and engaged with them and said,
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.720]   hey, we don't have money, but can we get you a meal?
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.580]   Are you hungry?
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.620]   And they said, yeah, we're hungry.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.820]   And said, what would you like?
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.060]   And she said, KFC.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.940]   She was real specific.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.860]   I said, all right, we'll find a KFC.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.900]   They got those in London.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.660]   And so, around the corner, there was a KFC
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:03.900]   and we went in and ordered a bucket of chicken
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   and biscuits and mashed potatoes and green beans
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:14.340]   and two large drinks and we carried them back to them
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.380]   and they were so elated.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.260]   They said, you came back, no one ever comes back.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.100]   And I said, of course we came back.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.260]   And we gave them the bucket of chicken
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.820]   and we sat down and what happened was gross, kind of.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.820]   I mean, they just were hungry
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.020]   and they just grabbed and mashed potatoes
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.220]   and just green beans and chicken.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.300]   It was all over their face
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.620]   and we're trying to engage them with the gospel,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.220]   but they weren't even, it was just like eating,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.860]   the sound of eating.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.460]   Imagine for just a moment, if I would've looked closer
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.420]   and I would've realized, wait a minute,
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.900]   are you Prince Harry and Meghan?
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.020]   What do you, imagine.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.580]   That's not what happened, but just imagine with me.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.420]   Imagine, imagine, imagine if that's what,
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.820]   what God, wait, hold on, guys, this isn't,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.740]   this isn't where you belong, you know?
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.580]   You belong in Kensington Palace.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.740]   I mean, you don't yet 'cause you're not married,
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.380]   but you belong there, Kensington Palace.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.940]   You're a prince, like you should go to the,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.580]   hey, how dare you say where I need to be, man?
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.420]   If I wanna be on the street, I'm a homeless person.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.660]   I'm a beggar, who are you to tell me,
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.780]   who are you to come at me and tell me I'm a prince?
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.540]   I'm not, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.340]   I'm just trying to define reality.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.700]   You're a prince, like you belong in the palace.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.520]   You have a home there.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.020]   You shouldn't be out here begging for scraps.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.640]   You should be in your palace.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.740]   You're for kingdom.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.260]   You're an heir, you're royalty.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.060]   You'll soon be royalty too.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.860]   This isn't who you are.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.060]   It's not who you are.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.060]   You understand?
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:01.100]   You trusted in Jesus, what he's done for you.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.300]   You become an heir to his kingdom.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.140]   You are a prince and a princess.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:10.540]   If you weren't made for strong drink and for the party,
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.740]   like the pagans,
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.380]   if you weren't made to experience
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.540]   and experience in different positions
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.740]   and different pleasures, the pagans,
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.060]   if you weren't made to return
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.160]   to those two-dimensional images of women and men
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.660]   who don't belong to you,
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.100]   created in the image of God to his sons and daughters
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.420]   so that you might have your way with them
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.660]   in the privacy of your home,
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.540]   sitting at your computer, on your cell phone,
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.520]   you weren't made for that, man.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:47.300]   If you weren't made to return to that deadly relationship
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.780]   or to find identity in men
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   or to continue to dress that way,
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.900]   to give away your body so that people would notice you,
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.860]   that you would walk out of a room and wonder,
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.240]   they're thinking about me.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.300]   You're loved by the king, man.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.140]   The king, he's crazy about you.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.780]   He's like, what do you want me to do to prove it?
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.940]   I'll give my son for you, my only son.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.700]   I'll give him to purchase you to me,
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.180]   to buy you from your sin, to set you free.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.980]   I'll do that for you.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.260]   It happened.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.380]   It really, really happened.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   God gave his only son because he loves you.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:39.860]   In summary, the truth will set you free.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.980]   Satan deceives to make you a slave.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:49.620]   And the remnant are God's relatives.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:58.980]   In writing this message, I was reminded of my own story.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:06.280]   A slave to relationships, a slave to pornography,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.540]   a slave to sex, a slave to money, a slave to stuff.
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.540]   I wanted a nicer car, a swaggier place, a better suit,
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.860]   watches for every day of the week.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.060]   A slave to what you thought of me.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.340]   Are they thinking about me?
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.580]   Do they like me?
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:32.540]   This is what I was, but here's the deal.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.900]   If you would have seen me, you wouldn't have seen a slave.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.300]   You'd be like, man, he's got it together.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.700]   Mr. Dallas right there.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.420]   Like everything wrong with Dallas in one person, that was me.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.460]   And I stumbled into a church.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.300]   I sat in the back row.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.260]   I was hung over.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.140]   And this guy's telling this story about a horse,
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.620]   a silly horse, a story about a horse.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.580]   And this horse just wanted to be free.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.500]   And in his pursuit of freedom, he had to hunt for food
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.900]   and hunt for water and hunt for shelter.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.700]   He didn't wanna be captured.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.900]   And one day this cowboy came up,
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.100]   and as this preacher talked, he said,
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.280]   he successfully captured this horse.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.580]   And he took him home.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.660]   And he loved him.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.420]   And he cared for him.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.260]   He provided for him.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.640]   He protected him from the elements.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.160]   He gave him food and water.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.620]   He learned to ride him and lead him
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.980]   to the things that he needed.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.500]   And it was this line right here that got me.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.340]   You ready?
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   He said, and it wasn't until he was fully submissive
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.740]   to his master that he truly experienced freedom.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.740]   And I just said, man, God, if you're real,
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.540]   if there's a God that I wanna give my life to you,
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.060]   you drive, I don't wanna drive.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:45.940]   You take my life.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.140]   You do with me whatever you please.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.900]   I know that I'm not doing the things that you desire for me.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.820]   And so all I really knew at that point was there was a God,
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.300]   but I really didn't think he was the Christian God.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.980]   I went home, I bought a book on world religions.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.020]   I looked at the Hindu faith, the Buddhist faith,
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.860]   the Jewish faith, the Islamic faith,
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.220]   Mormons, Jehovah's Witness,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.420]   Church of Christian Science and Scientology.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.980]   And as I explored those world religions,
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.340]   I kept tripping over the truth of Jesus.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.980]   I looked into the Bible and I was blown away
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.500]   by the evidence that supported that it hadn't been changed,
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.860]   that it was preserved, and that the message in it
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.620]   was this truth that led to life.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:32.820]   That 2018 years ago, on Jesus's birth,
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.300]   the calendar reset and every atheist you know
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.220]   acknowledges him by the date they put on their checks.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.860]   I was blown away by the evidence.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:49.180]   And I said, Jesus, I believe that you lived.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.460]   I believe that you died for me.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.820]   And I believe that God raised you from the dead.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.820]   And Jesus, I'm desperate for your Holy Spirit
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.780]   to come into my life, to help me,
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.020]   to free me from my slavery, to pornography,
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.660]   to stuff, to money, to girls, to sex, identity.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.460]   Would you give me a greater purpose
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.860]   and help me to live for you?
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:22.060]   And Jesus recruited me to the remnant by revealing truth.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.300]   And I can remember sitting on my friend's couch.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.820]   I was in Waco, Texas and I was sitting there
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.580]   and it was like the scales had fallen from my eyes,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.700]   like I was living in the Matrix.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.100]   I'm like, none of this is real.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.180]   Jesus is gonna come back and finish the work here.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.540]   What else matters?
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.380]   What am I gonna do?
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.100]   I should just start sharing the gospel
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.220]   with every breathing person alive.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.720]   I should give away all my money
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.380]   and leverage it for the kingdom.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.140]   I should begin to live completely
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.140]   and radically sold out for him.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.980]   God began to do a work in my life.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.860]   What else are you gonna live for?
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.480]   Is it true?
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.820]   If it's not true, then you are wasting your time here
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.060]   on a Tuesday night.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.100]   You need to be, they got $2 margaritas out there, man.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.660]   You need to go just shred it.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.620]   Go hard.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.340]   Sin more.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.360]   Experience more momentary pleasure.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.540]   Guys will love you.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.420]   They will use you and abuse you.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.720]   They will delight in your body.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.420]   Drink it up.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.220]   Girls, man, pull out your wallet
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.140]   and buy them some drinks and soak in their attention
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.580]   like there's nothing else.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:36.780]   But if it's true, you stop it.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.260]   And you start living for him.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.260]   Because anything else you do is a complete
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.660]   and total waste of your life,
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.860]   waste of your talents, waste of who you are.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.360]   In fact, it's not who you are.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.220]   It's not who you are.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.060]   It's your heads.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.740]   Let me pray that you would know that.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.820]   Father, would you help us to believe that we're yours?
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:04.480]   Would you help us to live for you?
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.620]   Would you help us to know you?
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.400]   Would you help us to walk with you?
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.820]   I pray, God, please, right now,
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.220]   that you're recruiting your remnant,
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.420]   that you're pulling them together here in Dallas
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.620]   and in Fort Worth and in Tulsa and in El Paso
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.900]   and in Oklahoma and in Houston and Houston
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.420]   and then in South Africa and Australia
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.700]   and in Rhode Island and all of the places
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.340]   where people are listening right now.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.400]   You're just recruiting your remnant, God,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.620]   that we would lock arms
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.220]   and that we would live radically for you tomorrow, God.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.700]   That we would boldly declare there is a truth
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.260]   and I know him and I'm gonna live for him.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   Because, God, you, we are, God, we are who you say we are.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   Sons and daughters, not slaves.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.760]   We are who you say we are, God.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:03.560]   Your sons and daughters, princes and princesses,
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.000]   not slaves to this world, not slaves to our sin,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.600]   not slaves to Satan.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.640]   We're yours, God, and you're enough.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.180]   And you're enough.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.880]   Would you remind us of that?
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.720]   Amen.
