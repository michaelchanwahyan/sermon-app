[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good evening and welcome to the porch.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.960]   relationships.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.600]   Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.240]   we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.280]   work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.120]   So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.600]   what God has to say about our relationships.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.400]   This is, after all, the Relationship Series.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.960]   Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.640]   Great to see you. Welcome to the Relationship Series. If you're here for
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.160]   the very first time over the course of the last several weeks we have been navigating
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.520]   God's design for connecting to one another. And I'm really excited for where
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840]   we're headed this evening, but before we go there
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.640]   I do want to say hey to some special friends that are tuning in online. All of
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360]   Porch Live, so grateful y'all are a part
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.840]   of what God is doing here in Dallas and I'm grateful that he's doing something
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.920]   exactly where
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.000]   you are. Special shout out to Porch Live Fresno,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.720]   Porch Live Fort Worth, and Porch Live Midland, Texas.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.480]   Midland down front, I love it.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.200]   In the Count of Monte Cristo
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.240]   Edmond Dantes said, "I,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960]   who have also been betrayed, assassinated,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.520]   and cast into a tomb, have emerged from that tomb by the grace of God
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.640]   and I owe it to God to take my revenge.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.160]   He has sent me for that purpose. Here I am."
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   Don Vito Corleone said in The Godfather,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.960]   "Revenge is a dish that tastes best when served cold."
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   Maximus in the movie Gladiator said, "My name is Maximus
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.960]   Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the North,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   general of the Felix legions, loyal servant to the true
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.080]   emperor Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.960]   husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.320]   in this life or the next." Inigo Montoya
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.440]   in The Princess Bride said, "Hello,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.920]   Prepare to die."
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.120]   And then Taylor Swift said this,
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   "But I got smarter.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.080]   I got harder in the nick of time. Honey, I rose up from the dead.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.240]   I do it all the time. I got a list of names
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   and yours is in red underlined. I check it once,
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.480]   I check it twice. Oh, ooh,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.360]   look what you made me do. Look what you..."
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.440]   We'll stop there.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.960]   Oh, the feeling of revenge, something our world can relate to
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.680]   so well since every single one of us,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   regardless of where we are, what our station is in life,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.800]   we'll find ourselves betrayed to one degree or the next.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.880]   Why do I tell you that? Because this idea of betrayal,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360]   whether it's a betrayal of values or personality or privacy
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.160]   or your background or religious affiliation,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.640]   whatever it may be,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.320]   all of us are subject to being betrayed at one point or another.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.920]   And that betrayal is frequently the underlying force behind most estranged
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.680]   relationships today. It's interesting.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.800]   If you go and you look at the market research,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   what you'll find is that the largest national survey on estranged
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   relationships recently found that 25% of Americans
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.360]   will experience an estranged relationship at some point in their life.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.120]   That means one out of every four people will experience estrangement,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.440]   meaning that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle aren't the only ones that feel a
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   rift in the family.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   You and I are subject to experiencing this at some point ourselves.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.400]   To carry on the idea,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   just one look at the bestsellers list for parenting and relationships on Amazon
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.440]   will prove this is also true because books like Set Boundaries,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.240]   Find Peace, Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.320]   It's not you identifying and healing from narcissistic people.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.040]   I'm glad my mom died, which is apparently a comedy,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.080]   but it sounds like there's some pain there.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   And Trauma Bonding all made the top 25.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.840]   In a different study done by Cornell,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   researchers found that 10% of all people surveyed within our nation are
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.320]   presently in an estranged relationship.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.400]   That right now out of the total American population,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.760]   10% of people are experiencing estrangement.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.280]   That means that 33 million people right now are experiencing this.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.040]   Why do I tell you all of this information?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.120]   Because there's a strong probability that each of us will face estrangement at
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.760]   some point in our life.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.600]   And there's a really strong possibility that some of you are facing
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.960]   estrangement right here tonight.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.320]   And the reason I unpack all of that for you is because we need to understand
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.680]   what does it look like for us to move through what is likely,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   not just a possibility, but an inevitability for all of us,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.640]   that we're not just going to experience it personally,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.280]   but we're likely going to meet someone, know someone,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.400]   be related to someone that is experiencing this themselves.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   How do we move our way through it?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   As we consider lost love and broken relationships and damaged unions on the
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.000]   basis of things like abuse, whether it's sexual or emotional or,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.200]   or physical or divorce or abandonment by a parent or a violation of one's own
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.680]   privacy, or your boundaries are not respected by someone,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.560]   there's control and manipulation perpetuated in your life by someone else.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.240]   What does it look like for us to walk through these types of difficulties and
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.120]   find ourselves better on the other side?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.600]   You see estrangement.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.360]   It's not something that we should ask the question of whether or not it will
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.880]   find us. The question is, what do we do when it finds us?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.080]   Which is exactly what I want to talk to you about tonight.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   In order for us to do it, we're going to be in the book of Genesis.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.280]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.720]   you can go ahead and grab it and you can turn with me a good place for you to
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.880]   land is probably chapter 42, but I'll just level with you from the get go here.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   We're going to be all over the grid because the guy we're looking at tonight,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   one who is extremely familiar with betrayal is a guy by the name of Joseph.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.920]   And what you need to know is that his story,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.680]   it unpacks from chapter 37 all the way to chapter 50.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   And so we're going to work through all of that literature together tonight.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.360]   And so we're not going to be in just one passage.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   We're going to be moving across a lot of scripture.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   And so here's my encouragement to you.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.960]   Follow what's on the screens and then go read it later on.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.880]   Like read all 13 chapters,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   catch up on what's happening in the life of Joseph.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.720]   But why we're looking at him is because I want us to consider how do we walk the
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.640]   road back from betrayal?
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.800]   And he's the perfect person to look at to help us understand it because this
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.480]   brother's story is riddled with betrayal.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.160]   Like you meet him when he's 17 years old and you find that more cycles of
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   betrayal and abuse move through his life in just a matter of 13 years,
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.640]   then likely many of us will experience in a lifetime.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.200]   Just to give you some context so that way you understand Joseph was abused by
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.160]   his family, trafficked by strangers, used by people he worked for,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.320]   sexually assaulted by his boss's wife, falsely accused,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.280]   thrown in prison and forgotten by the people that he thought were his friends.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.760]   For 13 years he moves from one abusive situation to another.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.880]   He's betrayed by people he trusts and he is victimized again and again and again.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.640]   Never do you see him as being solely in the wrong.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.520]   He never takes the offending seat.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.320]   He is always sitting in the offended seat.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.720]   And yet though this happens to him over and over and over again,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.720]   what you find as you study Joseph's story is that he's not alone because over
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   and over and over again, God was with him.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.760]   Which brings us to our first point as we consider what it looks like to walk the
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.680]   road back from betrayal in our lives.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.120]   We need to know that God never abandons the abandoned.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.800]   God never abandons the abandoned.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.520]   Like after Joseph was beaten and stripped and sold into slavery by his brothers,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.800]   we learned that God didn't abandon him. It says in Genesis 39 verses two through
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.000]   three,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.640]   you'll find them on the screens that the Lord was with Joseph and he became a
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   successful man and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.320]   His master saw the Lord was with him and that the Lord caused all that he did to
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.280]   succeed in his hands.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.320]   So much so that he rose to power within his master's house.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.440]   His master's name was Potiphar and Joseph,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.120]   because the Lord's favor was upon his life, rises to a position of power.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.360]   So much so that he's running the entire estate.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   Things are going extremely well until Potiphar's wife tries to seduce him.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.360]   And because he rejects her as her advances and she's scorned in rejection,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.720]   she ends up deciding to lie about him,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.440]   mar his character, have him fired from his job,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.000]   and then ultimately thrown in prison. And yet though all of it happened,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.920]   guess what? God did not abandon him.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.600]   We see in Genesis 39, 21,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.000]   but the Lord was with Joseph and he showed him steadfast love and he gave him
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.800]   favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. So much favor, in fact,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.160]   that Joseph, he's not just a prisoner.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.960]   He is the leader of the entire cell block.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.440]   Like he's running the prison and he,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.400]   what he finds is he's doing so as he meets a couple of different guys,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.120]   some cellmates of his that are having some dreams.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.240]   They're losing sleep to a couple of different dreams.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.080]   They can't seem to interpret. And that's kind of Joseph's specialty.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.160]   You know anything about a story? He's the interpreter of dreams.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.000]   And so they unpack for him what they're dreaming about in the evening.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   And Joseph tells him exactly what's up.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.640]   And what we learned is that one of them gets out of prison and ultimately
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.200]   re-ascends back to the court of Pharaoh himself. And Joseph tells him, Hey,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   that's going to happen. And once you go, don't forget about me.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.800]   Like I'm locked up down here, but I'm not supposed to be down here.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.880]   So when you get back to Pharaoh's side,
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.320]   remember my name and bring me out from where I am.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.480]   But as goes Joseph's luck,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.920]   he's totally forgotten about he's left in prison.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.320]   The guy does not keep his word whatsoever.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.080]   That is until Pharaoh begins to have some dreams of his own,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.760]   some things that he cannot interpret.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.840]   And so he decides to ask around and see if anybody knows of someone that can
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.240]   prophesy of dreams.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.560]   And it just so happens that Joseph's old cellmate remembers,
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.720]   I do know a guy there's this guy named Joe.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.800]   He's down in cell block A pull him out. He can help you interpret his dream.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.400]   And so Joseph gets brought out to Pharaoh and he begins to interpret to Pharaoh
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.080]   all that he's been dreaming. And he not only tells him, Hey,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.840]   this is the problem becoming, he tells him of a solution to that problem.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.960]   Pharaoh's so impressed. He hires him on the spot, brings him onto his team.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.520]   And what you realize is that God did not abandon him. Genesis 41,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.080]   37 through 41 says this proposal, the one that Joseph made,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.320]   it pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. And Pharaoh said to his servants,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.080]   can we find a man like this? And whom is the spirit of God?
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.840]   He's kind of one of a kind. And then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.240]   since God has shown you all this,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.280]   there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.680]   You shall be over my house and all my people shall order themselves as you
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.400]   command. Only as regards the throne, will I be greater than you.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.680]   That's a position of power.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   He's second in command of the ruling empire of the day, Egypt.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.280]   And that's exactly what Pharaoh says.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.160]   See I have set you over all the land of Egypt. You see over and over again,
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.560]   though Joseph was repeatedly abandoned by those he trusted,
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   he was never abandoned by a God who was actually trustworthy.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.640]   He's never abandoned by God who's actually a treasure. And because he knew it,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200]   Joseph never takes matters into his own hands.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.560]   Like he never rages against the heavens or raise the fist to God.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.600]   He never tries to finesse and angle his way out of the difficulties he's facing.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.120]   Instead, he just decides to trust the Lord where he is.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.840]   Despite the fact that all the betrayal he's experienced has,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   has leveled him to a position he never should have been in.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.400]   He trusts the Lord who raises him consistently.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.760]   And what's crazy about it is no one would have blamed him if he would have
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.480]   raised a fist to heaven. Like no one would have looked at him and be like, dude,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.800]   you're crazy. Like, why are you doing that?
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.600]   Because the odds are that we would have done that ourself.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.560]   That we in the face of such injustice would have looked at God and been like,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   what are you doing? Why is this happening? It makes no sense, God.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.760]   And yet Joseph doesn't do it.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.080]   And it's interesting,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.640]   like as I was trying to pull together some examples to just help us understand
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   how popularized revenge is in our culture,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.160]   I decided to kind of leave them on the table because I don't need to pull a bunch
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.560]   of mainstream references to help us understand that revenge is popular.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   I just need to point to you because the truth of the matter is we think revenge
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   is a pretty popular idea.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.800]   Like we need to only look to ourself to realize that this is often the response
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.120]   we choose ourselves that we don't reflect what Joseph does.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.240]   We instead reflect what the world does. Like just think about it.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.800]   What happens when you get cut off in traffic?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.640]   You laugh because you do know what happens when you get cut off in traffic. Oh,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.600]   no, you didn't. You like,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.560]   you get the gas and you swear out and you cut them off and you make sure that you
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.800]   get right back in your respective position.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.720]   You establish street side superiority. How dare they?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.960]   Like what happens when someone writes a negative comment on one of your posts?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:23.760]   You know what? I'm going to get on their profile. I'm going to incriminate them.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.360]   I'm going to figure out what it is about them that gives them absolutely no
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.240]   validity with any respect to an opinion that they have to say about me.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.200]   And then you know what I'm going to do?
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.520]   I'm going to respond to something that's so much smarter than what they said that
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.800]   they're going to look dumb in front of everybody that's read their post.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.240]   What about when you run into the people that used to mock you in high school?
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.360]   Oh baby, when that 10 year reunion shows up, I'm going to look good.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.760]   I'm going to be successful. I'm going to be fit. I'm going to be ready.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.520]   They're going to know I'm going to make sure everyone's put on notice that I
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.480]   have actually surpassed them all. This is our natural response.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Like we don't want to turn the other cheek. We don't want to pull punches.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.000]   We don't want to bite our tongue. We want justice. We want vindication.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.480]   We want revenge.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:15.160]   So what are you wanting revenge for tonight?
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   And let me ask, like, what do you think it's going to cost you to get it?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.240]   If the research is true,
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   it's going to cost you so much more than it's going to cost the person you're
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.080]   actually trying to get revenge from.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.360]   Martin Luther King jr. said this in spite of the fact that the law of revenge
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.280]   solves no social problems,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.480]   men continue to follow its disastrous leading history.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.000]   It's cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.480]   self-defeating path.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.920]   So if we're not supposed to pursue revenge,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.840]   how then are we supposed to respond differently to the injustices in our life?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.080]   Well, we need to remember what Joseph does. What does Joseph do?
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.880]   What does Joseph know?
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.240]   He knows the sovereignty of God rules over the atrocities of men.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   That the sovereignty of God rules over every atrocity in mankind.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.760]   So just a few years ago, some really dear friends of mine and Brooke,
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.440]   they were dealt with some really tragic news.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:36.120]   They learned that they had had a miscarriage and the reason it was especially
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.560]   difficult for them in that moment,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.960]   though every miscarriage is tragic was because this was their first pregnancy.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.080]   And so they learned that they had had a miscarriage and in a moment where no one
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.000]   would have blamed them for being frustrated with God,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.600]   like no one would have looked at them and be like, man,
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.240]   it doesn't make sense that you're not angry with the Lord,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.880]   that you don't feel like he's abandoned you,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.440]   that you're actually raising a fist and raging against the heavens.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.120]   They chose not to do any of it. Instead, they remained faithful,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.680]   consistent in their belief. Why?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:10.320]   Because they trusted God's character. They trusted God's sovereignty.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.000]   They knew there's nothing in heaven or on earth that does not
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.040]   pass, which God does not allow. And what we know is he's good.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.960]   Our God is so good. And so therefore we're not going to give up on him.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.320]   We're not going to question him.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   We're not going to lose trust because we believe he's the one that's in control.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.920]   He's the one that works for good.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.520]   He's the one that takes something so broken as this and somehow he makes it into
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.280]   beauty. And because this was their perspective,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.160]   they named their little girl Eden,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.200]   which means delight in the reason they named her Eden is because as they would
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.000]   tell her story to those watching around,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.320]   they wanted people to know, Hey, God is the giver of life,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.480]   not just in the here and now, but he's the giver of life forever and always.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.240]   That's what a perspective that properly understands God's sovereignty looks
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.840]   like. A perspective like that,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   like it can stare down the barrel of the world's worst and it can still stake
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.760]   claim on the fact that God is good, that he can be counted on.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.200]   That he's not forgotten, that he's not run out on you,
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.400]   that he hasn't abandoned you. Deuteronomy 31,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.880]   8 says it is the Lord who goes before you.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.040]   He will be with you. He won't leave you or forsake you.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.080]   Do not fear or be dismayed.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.680]   Hebrews 13, 6 says so we can confidently say the Lord is my helper.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   I will not fear. What can man do to me? This kind of perspective,
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.640]   it's so important as we consider what it looks like to walk back down the road
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.880]   from betrayal. Because without this kind of perspective,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.040]   everything else we talk about moving forward from this point here tonight is
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.400]   fruitless. Like if you don't have this focus,
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.680]   then everything else is useless. You might as well pack up and go home.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.800]   Because Joseph, everything in his life,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.120]   it was undergirded by the reality that he trusted God. He knew the Lord is
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.160]   sovereign. So whatever comes, hell, high water, I'm going to be okay.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.000]   I trust the Lord is with me. He knew.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   God doesn't just react to what happens in people's lives.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.240]   He rules over people's lives, that there are no exceptions to God's sovereignty.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.280]   Not even you, not even your story.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:46.880]   Like God, he doesn't waste our pain. But here's the thing, Borge,
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.680]   we can waste our pain if we're not careful.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.400]   Like as we look at the story of Joseph, what we see is that,
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.320]   is that though he trusted the Lord and God provided for him time and again,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.120]   he still,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.200]   he still had some piece of his heart living in the shadow of his estrangement.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.440]   That though he was able to move forward in life,
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   what you see is he doesn't actually walk back from betrayal.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.200]   He walks down the road into bitterness.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.440]   And the way we know it is because if we keep reading in his story, we see, man,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.080]   he's gotten everything he's wanted. Like no one would,
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.040]   no one would think otherwise from trading into a life like Joseph had when he
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.000]   found himself in Egypt because he ascended to the right hand of Pharaoh.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   Like he got a new name and he got a new house and he got a new wife and he got a
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.720]   new family. Like everything looked amazing.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.040]   And yet as he stands at the precipice of all this new,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.880]   he looks into his family and he decides to name his sons a couple of different
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.280]   things. It says in Genesis 41, 51 and 52,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.520]   Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.640]   For he said, God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.520]   The name of the second he called Ephraim.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.240]   For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.960]   How do we know that Joseph didn't waste his pain?
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.800]   Because if we look at the names of these two boys,
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.640]   what we realize is he basically names his kids,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.240]   screw you and look at me now.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:19.560]   That's essentially what he does. Like he looks,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.440]   he looks at his former life and he says, no, no, no. In my now life,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.000]   the life that I have here today,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'm going to establish and identify the fact that I'm not who I once was,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.440]   that what you did to me isn't being done to me any longer.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.840]   Like he decides in response to the powerlessness that he felt as a child to
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.240]   declare his power through his own children.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.440]   And it's because his betrayal grew into bitterness. Why?
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.840]   Because the longer you dwell on an offense,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.240]   the more data you begin to collect about that offense.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.160]   And the more data you collect about an offense,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.440]   brews more disdain for the offender. And we know this,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.640]   like this is why when someone pokes a little fun at you or they take a quick
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.880]   jab or they make a passing comment, when you should just dismiss it,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.880]   you dwell on it. And as you dwell on that one thing, they said,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.200]   you start to think about everything that they said.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.800]   And if you think about everything they said,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.120]   you start to think about all the ways they said it.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.760]   And if you start to think about all the ways they said,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.840]   you start to think about what they probably meant by it.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.640]   And where it was just a passing comment about something weird you wore once is
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.000]   now like a meticulously curated assault on your identity because you have
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.040]   embittered yourself against them.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.000]   You have imprisoned yourself to their thoughts about you.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.480]   You have allowed what they said to take greater root in your life than it was
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.480]   ever meant to.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.160]   You've allowed it to take greater real estate in your heart than it was ever
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.200]   meant to. That's why victim mentality is just self-sabotage.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.360]   Like it's imprisoning yourself to the past until you're so burnt up with
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.000]   bitterness that the greatest betrayer in your story isn't anyone else.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.840]   It's you.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.880]   And yet the author of Hebrews tells us of a different way.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.040]   He says in chapter 12,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.280]   make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be Holy.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.480]   Without holiness, no one will see the Lord.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.440]   See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.120]   grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.640]   What's he saying? Bitterness is like a weed.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   So when I became a homeowner,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.800]   the man in me was instantaneously in love with his front yard.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.480]   I loved it. I love striping that thing and edges,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.120]   that thing and making it look plush.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Like I prided myself on that green pillow top mattress I called my front yard
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.080]   and I so prided myself in it that I waged war on anything that would seek to
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.360]   kill it, which meant I took weeds very seriously.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.280]   What's the best way to deal with weeds?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.360]   You do not wait until they break through the soil.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.040]   You address the issue before they ever even appear.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.840]   You weed and feed. You do exactly what the Puritans used to say.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.400]   Like you, you keep short accounts with both God and men
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.240]   because, and this is your second point,
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.800]   the only cure for a bitter spirit is a forgiving heart.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.280]   The only cure for a bitter spirit is a forgiving heart,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.520]   which is something we learn in chapter 42 as Joseph and his brothers,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.960]   they finally collide.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.560]   Like they come face to face for the very first time in 13 total years.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.200]   After all of this estrangement, here they are face to face.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.720]   And it's at this point in the story when famine has struck the land and it's
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.740]   caused Joseph's brothers to come to him that we read this in Genesis 42.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.520]   Now Joseph was governor over the land.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.680]   He was the one who sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brothers,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.640]   they came and they bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.840]   And Joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   but he treated them like strangers. And he spoke roughly to them.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.080]   Where do you come from? He said, they said from the land of Canaan to buy food.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.960]   And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.880]   Why didn't they recognize him?
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.520]   Because a lot changes between 17 and 30 years old, right?
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.800]   And he was now an Egyptian, which meant that he had shaved his face.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.840]   He had changed his clothes. He didn't look like them any longer.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   They did not recognize him.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.360]   And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.720]   Those dreams, which God had given to him at one point in his story,
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.880]   before all of the betrayal began,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.160]   those dreams where he saw 12 sheaves of wheat
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.960]   bowing down before him. He remembers it in this moment.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.680]   And what he realizes is that dream wasn't about something in the past.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.800]   That dream was about this moment right here and now.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:13.600]   And what it helps him to realize is that he didn't arrive at this moment,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.680]   tossed to and fro by the whims and will of man.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.360]   He arrived at this moment by the working of God.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.440]   Like it liberates him. It moves him out of,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.320]   out of being a victim of bitterness.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.720]   And it allows him to become an agent of forgiveness.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.880]   He realizes in this moment that I've not been,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.720]   I've not been under the thumb of men more powerful than me.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.040]   I've been under the hand of a God more powerful than them.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.720]   That God has been orchestrating my steps. He has been directing my movement.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.800]   He has brought me to this moment right now.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.480]   And so it enables me to leave my bitterness and take up my forgiveness.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.520]   So what does it look like to forgive? What's it look like to forgive?
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.720]   How do we do it? Is it the act?
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.800]   Is it an act of the heart that you know what that hurt really bad?
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.680]   I don't hurt anymore.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.800]   I've decided to put all that pain away and now I feel so good.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.760]   I have such bliss because of you. Or is it an act of the mind that though,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   that does hurt so very bad.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.800]   I will reason myself towards reconciliation.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.280]   That is a preferred future and I will establish my steps to move that direction.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.680]   No, it's neither of those things. Forgiveness is an act of the will.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.640]   It's an act of the will.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   It's a choice to forgive the other person.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.640]   And here's the thing like that can feel like, Oh,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.400]   I'm just supposed to choose to forgive them. That can feel really disabling.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   And yet it's not disabling when you think about the motivation that undergirds
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.320]   that choice. Because when you make a choice to forgive,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   you do so on the basis of a love that transcends what they did to you and
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.080]   depends on what Christ did for you.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   That's why you can do it. Luke 7 47 says,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.560]   therefore I tell you her sins, which are many, they're forgiven. Why?
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.440]   Because she loved much, but he was forgiven. Little loves little.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.200]   You see,
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.880]   we're able to forgive because we have been forgiven ourselves.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.840]   Not because we earned it or we deserved it,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.960]   but simply because Christ chose to give it.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.160]   That's why. So what does forgiveness look like?
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.080]   Forgiveness looks like setting your oppressor free. That's it.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.120]   Forgiveness looks like setting your oppressor free.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.880]   If you look at forgiveness in the Greek, it literally means to set free.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.240]   Like that's the idea. Like forgiveness,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   it doesn't use its power to make that person pay or it doesn't keep them
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.720]   underneath your thumb. It doesn't keep score against them.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.920]   It doesn't hold a grudge.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.800]   It doesn't pray to God to strike them down at some point in the future.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.520]   That's not what forgiveness does. No.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.800]   Forgiveness releases them from your hate.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.160]   It liberates them from their shame.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.960]   It frees them from their failure.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.040]   And the reason we know that is because this is what Christ has done for us.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.400]   He has forgiven us our worst selves.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.560]   Like the watershed of grace covers,
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.960]   not just some of your sin, brother, sister, it covers all of it.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.120]   It covers every part of your story,
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.480]   especially the parts that you cringe the most over.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.360]   And because we've been forgiven like that, we forgive like that. Now,
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.840]   am I saying that people shouldn't be held accountable for their actions? No,
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.600]   of course not. Truthfully,
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.080]   everyone needs to be held accountable for their evil and some should face
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.760]   prosecution if it's criminal or if it's abusive. But here's the thing, porch.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.520]   The goal is never retribution.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.240]   That's always rehabilitation. Like it's not, you did this to me.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.280]   Now look what I'm going to do to you. That's not the heart of forgiveness.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.880]   So the heart of forgiveness is I want to help you get better.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.640]   Like I want to do what is loving towards you,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.920]   which means I'm going to give you an upward hand.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.960]   I'm going to move you to a new station in life.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.760]   I'm going to help you become who Christ wants you to become.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   That's why Jesus says in Matthew 18, if your brother sins against you,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.880]   go and tell him his fault between you and him alone,
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.160]   which I think is really important because we often want to tell everybody else.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.440]   But when someone offends you, the goal would be to go and tell,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.160]   go and tell them directly between you and them alone.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.760]   And the reason you do it is because if they listen to you,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.960]   you've gained your brother. Do you see it?
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.240]   Like the motive behind accountability, it's not vengeance.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.440]   It's not to get back at someone. It's to win them over. It's to help them out.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.880]   It's to lead them to life. It's to ultimately make them more like Christ.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.280]   Like it's a desire for the restoration of the individual.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.840]   And it's a desire for the reconciliation of the relationship.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.880]   But here's what you need to know. Forgiveness,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   it is the precursor to reconciliation, but where forgiveness is a choice,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.040]   reconciliation is a process because reconciliation is a process more than a
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.200]   decision. Your third point for the night.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.760]   Reconciliation is a process more than a decision where forgiveness is an act of
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.120]   the will. Reconciliation is an act of wisdom.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.400]   We see it in Joseph's own story.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.280]   Like he realizes that God has been in control this entire time,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   that everything that's come to pass has been under the rule and the reign of
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.680]   God's own sovereignty. And we learn like in chapter 42,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.760]   he forgives them from his heart.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.160]   But it's not until chapter 45 that the two disparate parties are actually
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.640]   reconciled to one another. Why? Like, why did it take three extra chapters?
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.440]   Why couldn't he have done it all in chapter 42?
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.280]   Why did he have to wait until chapter 45 to get to a place where he could
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.480]   forgive his brother and reconcile the relationship?
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.360]   Because he needed to,
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.640]   he needed to know that they were ready to reconcile themselves.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.680]   He needed to know that they were safe to be reconciled to.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.480]   And some of you need to know that tonight.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.760]   Like you're in the midst of an estranged relationship,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.880]   whether it's from a parent or it's an old romantic interest,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   or it's a brother or a sister or someone in your community that you're
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.280]   no longer friends with, whatever the nature of your estranged relationship,
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.160]   you're in a position tonight where you're longing for some kind of reconciliation.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   Like you want to bury the hatchet. You want to go back to the way things were.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.600]   You want to go further than the way things were.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.080]   You want to be better than it ever was before.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.720]   And yet what you need to know is that they're safe to be reconciled to.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.320]   If you're here and you're the offending party, you need to consider,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   what does it look like for me to grow in a way that demonstrates to the other
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.720]   that I'm safe to be with, that I'm someone you can trust, that I have matured.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.360]   I have learned, I have surpassed my selfishness.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.680]   What we learn,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.720]   and I'm so grateful that this is what happens in Joseph's story is we actually
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.440]   get a picture of what it looks like to move towards reconciliation.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.120]   And we learned that it's two things that it's A plus B equals C that point one
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.320]   and point two is going to equal reconciliation. So what are the two points?
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.080]   Point one is that you have to test, improve the individual.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.320]   You have to test, improve. We won't read it for the sake of time,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.160]   but chapters 42, 43 and 44,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.320]   they're all about the process Joseph goes through to discern if his brothers are
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.160]   safe enough to reconcile with. It's fascinating.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.520]   Like he's so thoughtful about the way he tests improves his brothers.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.800]   Like first he claims as they come to him in chapter 42,
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.520]   you're here to spy out the land of Egypt,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.480]   which is a reflection of their claim that he came to spy them out for the sake
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.560]   of their father. Next,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   he binds one of their brothers Simeon before their eyes to be left in a foreign
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.400]   land,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.880]   which parallels perfectly the fact that he was bound to be sent into a foreign
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.240]   land himself. As you move on from there,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.880]   you find that as they go to prepare to return to Canaan,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.840]   he has his servants secretly put money into their sacks so that as they make the
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.720]   journey home, they'll find that they were paid.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.000]   How do we even get this money?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   And the reason he does it is because when they sold him off,
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.800]   they had money from the exchange.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.600]   They went home with money in their sack. It doesn't just stop there.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.360]   Like once they returned to Egypt with their youngest and most beloved brother,
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.200]   Benjamin,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.080]   Joseph sets him up that youngest and most beloved brother to appear as if he
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   stole this silver cup,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   Joseph's own cup to test whether or not the brothers would sell him out the way
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.200]   they sold him out to save their own hide.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.520]   Why is Joseph doing all that? Is he just trying to get his pound of flesh?
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.440]   He's trying to help them live through some semblance of what he himself
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.840]   suffered. No, that's not what he's trying to do.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.320]   He is trying to take them back to the same scenario they once lived through
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.640]   together to see how they respond. Hey,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.440]   in the face of a very similar situation,
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:41.920]   do you respond with violence and aggression and selfishness or do you respond
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   differently? Have you changed? Have you matured?
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.040]   Have you grown and transformed?
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.400]   Are you worthy of my trust today because you weren't worthy of it then,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.440]   but I'm willing to consider if you're worthy of it now because I want us to be
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.920]   reconciled to one another. He tests and he proves him.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:04.080]   Here's what you need to know, Porch. If you're wanting for reconciliation,
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   then you have to understand what I mean by testing and proving.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:13.200]   It is not a sufficient justification for reconciliation to hear someone say,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.960]   man, I know what I did was wrong and I really want to do better.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   That's not enough. It's not enough to have really well-meaning intentions.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.680]   No, there needs to be faithful action behind it.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.840]   Now,
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:36.560]   as they work to attest to the quality of their character and the consistency of
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.000]   their godliness, you pray for them. You wait with them. You see,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.920]   if you go and you read a story, Joseph breaks bread with his brothers.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.320]   He enjoys their company. He does so in safe spaces,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   but he doesn't rush to reconciliation because he needs to test and prove that
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.160]   they are who he needs them to be. And you have to do the same.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.320]   So the first thing you have to do is you have to test and prove.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   The second thing that must be true is there must be grace and truth.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.680]   That's what we see in chapter 45. If you jump ahead a little bit,
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.120]   like after Joseph has tested and proven that his brothers are in fact safe to
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   reconcile with, we read this verse three, and Joseph said to his brothers,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.360]   I'm Joseph. Like, is my father still alive? But his brothers,
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.760]   they could not answer him for they were dismayed at his presence. You know,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.360]   they were caught. Oh my gosh, you're him. Like you're the guy that we sold off.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.720]   Oh my God. Like what's going to happen to us. And yet he looks at me and says,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.640]   no, come near to me, please. And they came near and he said,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.080]   I'm your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.680]   And now don't be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.280]   for God sent me before you to preserve life.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.960]   What's Joseph do? He speaks the truth to him.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.880]   He tells them what happened.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.480]   He tells them the God's honest truth of everything he endured,
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.000]   but not because he's trying to heap up guilt on them. Man, look what you guys did.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.320]   Look what you made me live through. How could you, how dare you?
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.560]   He doesn't do that. He tells them the truth, not just once.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.360]   He tells them twice that they sold him into Egypt
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.560]   because it's only when the truth is known,
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.120]   can grace respond.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.080]   Like he doesn't tell them because he wants them to be filled with guilt.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.840]   He tells them because he wants to flood them with grace.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.080]   That's why he does it. And that's what we have to do.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   We must be willing to speak the truth because then it prepares space for grace
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.360]   to invade. It's really interesting.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.680]   As you study the reconciliation account of Joseph,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.600]   what you realize is that over the course of chapters 42 to 50,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.680]   he cries seven different times.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.440]   If you're a Bible nerd, you're going to love this.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.560]   I think this is the coolest thing ever because if you track those different
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.680]   crying accounts, what you realize is they have a chiastic structure,
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:07.520]   which just simply means they are all pointing to the main idea of the story.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.440]   And so when you look at it, the first time he cries,
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.240]   mirrors the seventh time he cries.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.120]   The second time he cries mirrors the sixth time he cries.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.280]   The third time mirrors the fifth and the one that has no reflection that is the
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.200]   main point,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.920]   that is the hinge upon which the entire story is turning is the fourth time he
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.920]   cries. And what you realize is it's in verse 15.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.520]   It's right after he has told them the truth of what they did and he has made
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   space for grace to invade.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   We read this in verse 15 and he kissed all his brothers and he wept upon them.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.200]   After that, his brothers talked with him.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.720]   Like this is the marquee moment of their reconciliation.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.640]   That's what this moment signifies.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.120]   That's what this chiasm has been pointing to that they are going to be
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.840]   reconciled to one another,
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.040]   which can fill some of us with so much hope.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.800]   Like we're here tonight and we do have an estranged relationship in our life and
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.680]   a strange relationship with a parent or a sibling, whoever it may be.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.600]   And we're like, God, like there is hope for me.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.280]   We can be reconciled. And yet for some of you,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.600]   you hear that and all you feel is hopelessness
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.440]   because for whatever reason,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.520]   reconciliation is not an option for you at this time.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.000]   You see,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.360]   the reason it isn't is because either you can't reconcile or you won't reconcile.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.920]   So let me speak to you in the room. If that's you tonight,
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.600]   if you can't reconcile,
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   then what you need to know is that you have to trust the Lord.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.920]   Like if you can't reconcile because they're not around anymore,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:50.640]   because a parent has since died and they've moved on or because they don't care
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.920]   anymore, they've abandoned you and they've left you all alone.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   If the reason you are unable to seek reconciliation is because it's just not
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.240]   possible, you cannot do it.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.440]   Then what you have to know is you must trust the Lord.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   You have to trust the Lord. That's the appropriate response.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.760]   Because here's the thing, Porch.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.120]   If you study the scriptures and you track where everything is heading,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:18.080]   God is going to reconcile everything at some point in the future.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:23.600]   He is going to right every wrong. He is going to wipe every tear.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.920]   He is going to make things well again.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.040]   And so if you're here and you can't reconcile, then just know this.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.520]   He can for you. He will do it.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.360]   He will face your injustices on your behalf.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.320]   For others of you, you're here and you won't reconcile.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.480]   Like Kyle, you don't know what they did to me.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.000]   Like you don't know where they took me, what they did to me,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.160]   the way they invaded my privacy, the way that they controlled my life,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.360]   the way they pushed me underneath their will.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.680]   They subjected me to their oppression. You don't know.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.720]   I'm not going to forgive them. I won't do it. It is insane what they did.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.680]   What you need is grace. That's what you need.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.640]   And I'm not rushing you to that end, but I am saying
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:16.680]   you have a high King in heaven who knows full well what it feels like to be
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:22.800]   betrayed, slandered,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.960]   mocked, scorned, spit upon.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.880]   And totally,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.280]   totally asundered.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.640]   He had grace for them.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:48.040]   There's a scripture that says he wants all people to come to the knowledge of his
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.520]   repentance.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.600]   And that includes the person that perpetuated whatever that insidious evil is
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.440]   against you.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.440]   So you have grace for them because your King has grace for them too.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.360]   And yet there are some of us here that aren't filled with hopelessness at the
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.640]   thought of this. You're filled with hope.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.840]   And yet what you need to know is you consider the thought of like, man,
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.800]   I can reconcile and things can be great again. We can move back,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.400]   not just to where they've been, but we can go forward to where it should be.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.720]   What you need to know is reconciliation is not going to be perfect.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.320]   Like if you track the story of Joseph and his brothers,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.720]   what you see is it's not just five pages away.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.880]   There's a rift in the family again.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.040]   That as you come to the end of Genesis in chapter 50,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.360]   you find that his brothers,
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.160]   they're terrified because their father has gone to be with the Lord.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.360]   He has passed away. And as they look at Joseph, they're like, man,
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.920]   he has no reason to treat us well any longer. Like dad's not here.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.480]   He doesn't have to play nice anymore.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.920]   He could have been doing this for dad all along, but now he could be rid of us.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.040]   He could dispense of us. We don't know what he's going to do.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.160]   They're wracked with fear. And yet Joseph tells them in the face of that fear,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.800]   he says in Genesis 50, do not fear.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:06.240]   For am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me,
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.080]   but God,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:12.360]   God meant it for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.720]   as they are today. Joseph says, God rules my life.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.040]   Like he ruled it to this day and he will rule it for all my days.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   And even though there were times in the past that were hard,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.200]   look at the way he's restored it. Look at the way he's redeemed it.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.360]   I have a story, the likes of which only God could write. I trust him.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.480]   I don't trust myself. Am I in the place of God? No, you're safe with me.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.400]   God has been good no matter what may come.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.640]   Even when our father passes and future adversity prevails,
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.560]   I know that my hope is secure,
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.440]   that I have a steadfast promise, that I have a truth which is trustworthy
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.360]   because God is with me. Do you know that?
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.200]   Do you know that for yourself that God is with you?
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   And so as you move forward in life and you face the estrangements in your story
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.320]   and you seek after reconciliation,
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.720]   that no matter what is ahead, God will provide. He'll take care of you.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.960]   You see, that's not just the narrative of Joseph's story.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.280]   That is the narrative of Jesus's story.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   That every one of us, we were estranged from God.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.720]   We were separated in our sin.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.680]   We were totally alienated from his presence.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.880]   And yet what you know is that Adam and Eve, our father and mother,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.640]   sin against God and they're sent away from him and they move to the East.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.240]   God goes with them.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.280]   That God's heart was never to have distance between you and him,
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.200]   but his heart was to bridge the gap.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.280]   And he planned it from the very beginning of the Bible.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.400]   That he always wanted to build a bridge and make a way for you to come home to
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.560]   him again. That estrangement wouldn't be your story.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.640]   And the reason we know is because he never abandoned us.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.960]   Like Jesus Christ came for us when we were worthy of being
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.480]   abandoned. And he didn't just come to be with us,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.000]   but he came to save us,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.960]   to cure the bitterness of our sin through his forgiving work on the
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.080]   cross, by absorbing into himself all the consequence of your sin.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.840]   Did you know like your sin is worthy of eternal damnation?
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.200]   And yet Christ said, I don't want that for you.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.840]   I will take that instead.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.280]   I will absorb the wrath of God into me that you might have
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.920]   reconciliation with God instead,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.080]   that you can have relationship to him instead that you can receive his love
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.040]   instead.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.760]   And in his resurrection, Jesus has reconciled us.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.800]   That any who would place their faith in him,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.840]   they would be restored in full working right,
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.640]   in a wonderful relationship to God.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:11.840]   If you're here and you're considering the estranged relationships in your story,
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.400]   the first thing you must consider
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.800]   is whether or not you're estranged from God.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.240]   His heart is to be reunited to you.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:28.720]   We have to first approach him before we can approach anyone else.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.600]   Let me pray for us. God, we're so grateful for this evening.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.800]   Thank you God for just being kind to us.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.560]   That's the story of the gospel.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.640]   You're kind and merciful and loving and gracious God.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.080]   And we know you never abandoned us.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:48.440]   That when we went far off, you did not leave us alone, but you chased us down.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.680]   You raced after us and you are God's seeking to bring us home.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.320]   I pray God if there are friends here tonight that do not know you before they
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.400]   would consider any other relationship, they would just consider you.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.480]   That God they have to get a relationship with you before God,
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.440]   they can have a relationship with others.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:14.200]   Lord, I know this idea of estrangement, it's such a painful concept.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.080]   As we sing this last song, Lord,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.840]   I pray that you would be near to the broken heart of the God.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.520]   You would save the crushed in spirit that those who are here and they are
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.240]   wildly estranged from someone,
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:35.280]   they might sense your kindness near to them this evening in greater measure than
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.000]   they ever have before. We love you, Lord. And it is in Christ's name we pray.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.160]   Amen.
