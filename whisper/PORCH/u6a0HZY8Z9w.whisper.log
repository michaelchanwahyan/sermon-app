[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.560]   - Well, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.640]   My name is Josiah Jones and I came on staff about a year ago
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.220]   and I wanna welcome you wherever you are tuning in
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920]   around the country and even the world.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.980]   Welcome and for our porch live locations,
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.540]   El Paso, Texas, Houston, Texas, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.000]   Tulsa, Oklahoma, and many, many more.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800]   Welcome, we are glad that you're hanging out
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.160]   with us tonight.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.620]   Well, I don't know if you saw this past Sunday,
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.720]   our government came out and had an emergency
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.160]   press conference where the FDA,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.480]   the Food and Drug Administration,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   basically called any American who had the coronavirus
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.160]   and defeated it.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   They basically asked, hey, we want your blood plasma
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.000]   because if you had the coronavirus and you've defeated it,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   you have these antibodies within your blood
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.680]   that can help those who have the coronavirus
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   and are sick and are in the hospital
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.420]   and really essentially are on their deathbed,
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.160]   we can help them.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.840]   And honestly, we can hopefully keep them from dying.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.400]   And so this is what they came out with this past Sunday.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.040]   And so they're asking Americans who have contracted
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.680]   the coronavirus and defeated to share what they have
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800]   to help those in need.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.920]   And so I start there tonight because that's what we
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.560]   as believers, Christians, are called to do.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.320]   We are called to share what we have to help those
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.840]   who are in need.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.160]   Only our virus isn't corona.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.200]   Our virus is sin.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.880]   And listen, we have the antibodies,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.080]   AKA the gospel, the good news, Jesus Christ,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   to defeat the sin that lies within every single one of us.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.420]   The good news is that Jesus died for your sins
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.320]   and rose again.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.480]   See, why is this good news?
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   Because we don't have to die for our sins because Jesus did
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.360]   or we can choose to die for our sins.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740]   We can suffer for our sins or you can choose to believe
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.880]   that Jesus did.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480]   It's what theologians calls the great exchange,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040]   that we get what Jesus deserved and he got what we deserved.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.160]   We get life and we get an heir in his kingdom.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.040]   See, we get a reward from a person who has lived
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800]   their life perfectly.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.720]   And listen, I know anytime we talk about this idea
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.520]   of sharing this good news, the gospel,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.200]   Jesus, it causes a lot of fear inside of us all,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.040]   inside of us all, including myself.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   This idea that, hey, man, it's just uncomfortable.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.320]   This idea of, man, how do I do it?
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.720]   And if I do it, man, what are they gonna say about me?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.480]   It's just kind of awkward.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360]   I don't wanna be seen as the guy that,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.640]   kind of the Bible beater or the guy that's shoving Jesus
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   down someone's throat.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.320]   Honestly, I don't know what I would say
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.880]   if I was asked a question that I don't know the answer to.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.960]   I don't wanna come across as judgmental,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.480]   you know, one of those people.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200]   And so tonight I wanna walk us through the ABCs
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.480]   of what it looks like to share what we have as believers
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.760]   to those who are in need.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   I wanna walk us through, I wanna bring it down
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.760]   to just a really elementary level
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.200]   for people who maybe have been following Jesus
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   for the longest time or are new to the faith
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.240]   or they find themselves in this pandemic,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.720]   they're new, they're older, younger.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.100]   I wanna bring us to a place where everybody,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.320]   as we walk out of this place and we tune off
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.240]   from hearing this message and jumping on
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   to cheer the Dallas Mavericks to another victory,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.640]   we know at the end of this message
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.160]   how to share our faith with those who are in need.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.360]   So let's start with the A.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.440]   The A stands for ask, ask, ask God for boldness.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   So we're gonna look at a guy named Paul.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.880]   And man, he's in the scriptures and Paul is,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   man, basically he's a guy that before Christ was marked
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.420]   by persecuting the church and actually killing Christians.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.000]   The story of Paul is a story of redemption of Jesus Christ
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.900]   and proof that, man, you are never too far
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.880]   from the grace of God.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.360]   Some of you tuning in tonight,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.040]   you think that God doesn't want anything to do with you
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   because of your sin and because of the struggles
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.920]   that you continually find yourself in.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.280]   Or there's no way that he could use you.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.920]   And I just encourage you tonight
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.680]   to open your Bibles to Acts 9
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   and read the story of this guy named Paul.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.200]   A guy who, by so many historians,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.120]   they said he was a persecutor of epic proportions.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   But then it led him to be in a hope dealer,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.240]   bent on spreading the gospel throughout the world.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.620]   And look at what he says in Acts 4.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.060]   We're gonna be in Acts chapter 4, starting in verse 29.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.620]   This is Paul and this is a prayer, a famous prayer,
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.140]   that him and the early church prayed
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.360]   as the church was getting off the ground
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.440]   and it was spreading like wildfire
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.460]   out to the unknown parts where the gospel,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.440]   the good news of Jesus, had never gone before.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.520]   And look at what they pray here.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.080]   Now Lord, consider their threats
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.060]   and enable your servants to speak your word
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.940]   with great boldness, verse 30.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.560]   Stretch out your hand and heal and perform signs and wonders
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.420]   through the name of your holy servant Jesus.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.360]   After they prayed, the place where they were meeting
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740]   was shaken and they were filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.240]   and they began to speak the word of God boldly.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.060]   All because they said, did you catch that?
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.700]   Hey, we're gonna pray for boldness.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.640]   Did they pray for comfort?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.620]   Did they pray for convenience?
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.340]   No, they prayed for boldness.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   See, I believe the two greatest idols in my life
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.900]   and those of us here tonight and those tuning in online
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.040]   is comfort and convenience.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   Like if I had to look at my sin track over the last week,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.320]   I would be able to categorize them
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.940]   under comfort and convenience.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.700]   The times where I was short-tempered
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.600]   with my wife and my children,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.140]   it's because I was inconvenienced.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.800]   The times that maybe you looked at an image,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.880]   a two-dimensional image on your computer or your phone
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.280]   is maybe because of comfort and convenience.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.640]   It's a lot easier just to look at that image
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   and get your feel, right, than to actually pursue a lady.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.680]   See, I believe the two greatest idols in our life
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.320]   fall under comfort or convenience.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.360]   And look right here, they didn't pray for either.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.760]   They prayed for boldness, to share the word of Christ.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.880]   And so here's how it looks for some of you.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.200]   Like let me just bring this down
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.880]   to a very ground-level view.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.840]   You're sitting in your car,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.600]   you're getting ready to hang out with some friends
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.660]   for happy hour after work one day.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.320]   And you know this, they don't know
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.360]   that you really have a faith
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.640]   because you haven't talked about it
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.680]   and they know you for sure aren't gonna be sharing the faith
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.840]   but this is my encouragement to you,
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.800]   that you would just pray a simple prayer.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.040]   God, would you give me boldness
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.000]   to open my mouth and share my faith?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   You're sitting in the airport
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.000]   and you're getting ready to board a plane
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.080]   and you know that awkward, just really close to people.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.600]   And I just encourage you in that moment
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.760]   before you board the plane that you would just say,
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.800]   God, would you please help me to be bold with this person
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.300]   that I'm about to sit next to?
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.020]   And listen, you might not even do it.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.120]   Like you might not even open your mouth
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.820]   and you might not even say anything
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.080]   but let me tell you, this is the start
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.440]   that you would ask God for boldness
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.880]   to open your mouth and share the hope that lies within you.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.440]   You don't have to share everything.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.520]   No one's gonna hold you,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.660]   God's not holding you accountable,
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.080]   no, everything in this book.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.160]   He's saying, hey, share what you know.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.960]   But you're building the muscle of boldness
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   in the same way, how do you build muscles physically?
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.560]   You work them out, you step out and do different exercises
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.960]   to confuse the muscles, right?
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.920]   In the same way, God's looking at you and me
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.240]   and saying, hey, step out.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.920]   And do something that's gonna build
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.340]   that spiritual muscle of boldness.
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.220]   You wanna know a prayer that God will answer every time?
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.040]   It's this one.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.420]   It's this prayer right here.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.780]   It's the prayer for boldness to share the good news
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.220]   of Jesus Christ with those around us.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.660]   Watch out, like listen, if you decide to pray this prayer,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.460]   watch out because God is gonna put people in your path
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.260]   to share this with.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.040]   Like what would it look like right now
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.920]   if the thousands of young adults that are tuning in,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.260]   that are watching and listening to this message,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.420]   that you guys would get a glimpse of this idea
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.220]   of asking God for boldness,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.220]   praying and begging him that God,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.780]   you would fill me with courage.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   Because I know he wants to use you.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.420]   But the question is, do you believe
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.340]   that he wants to use you?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.140]   Do you believe that he can use you?
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.020]   It's this Acts 4 prayer, it goes something like this,
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.780]   and it's gonna be up on the screen,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.940]   and it says this, it says,
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.360]   "Lord, empower your servants to walk in love
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.840]   "and speak your word with great boldness.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.260]   "Stretch out your hand and save every young adult
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.280]   "in Dallas and Austin and El Paso and Houston and Boise
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.360]   "and Northwest Arkansas and Tulsa and Cincinnati
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.600]   "and Indianapolis and the entire country."
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.780]   And this isn't just some pie in the sky,
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.400]   pithy prayer that we pray.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.680]   Like we believe he can.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.320]   We believe that he wants to.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.540]   If his people, you and me, would step out
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.780]   and open our mouth,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.400]   if you're not gonna remember this prayer, then no worries.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.900]   Like take your phone out now,
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.860]   because we've created an Instagram story for this prayer,
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.500]   for you to be able to save
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.860]   and for you to be able to put on
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.140]   as a wallpaper on your phone,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.140]   just as a reminder as you wake up
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.340]   and you look at your phone, because don't lie,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.640]   you know that's the first thing you look at
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.700]   when you wake up, it ain't opening that Bible, come on.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.140]   Just keeping it real up here.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.900]   But the Lord would use that, right?
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.260]   The Lord would use that to remind you.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:37.660]   Lord, would you empower Josiah to walk in love
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.040]   and to speak your word with great boldness?
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.460]   And would you stretch out and save the young adults
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.620]   that you're gonna place in my path today?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.800]   Listen, we can never be too timid
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.280]   where we won't interrupt others.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.920]   Several weeks ago when we actually got to kick off the porch
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.100]   and it was the first porch back from quarantine,
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.320]   the porch had ended and I was up here at the front
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.000]   and just waiting for people to come forward
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.820]   and nobody really did, so I bolted up to the loft
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.880]   and that's where we have First Steps.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.500]   It's an opportunity for people to get connected
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.960]   to the church and also connect to Christ.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.180]   And there was a guy that got up in the middle of it
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.420]   and he was on his way out and I just said,
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.980]   man, I think this is what God's calling me
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.140]   to go talk to this guy.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.220]   And so I went up to him, I just said,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.060]   hey man, what's your name?
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.020]   He's like, oh, it's Hunter.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.140]   And I'm like, oh man, great to meet you, man.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.180]   My name's Josiah and hey, I'm glad you're here.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.020]   Is this your first time?
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.520]   He's like, matter of fact, it is.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.540]   Like, man, you're in the right place.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.860]   Hey, do you have time?
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.020]   I'd love just to hear your story.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.380]   What's your story?
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.440]   He began to share his story and I'm like,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.760]   hey man, this isn't a question that's unique to you.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.640]   Man, I ask this question a lot when I'm out in the city
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.680]   and I come across young adults or I'm here at the porch
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.040]   and I just asked him, I just said, hey.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   I said, hey, Hunter.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.960]   Do you have a faith?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.200]   I said, if I was to ask you what is the gospel,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.780]   what would you say?
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.160]   He's like, man, I honestly, Josiah, I don't know.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.200]   I said, hey man, do you have a few minutes?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.360]   I'd love to share that with you.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.900]   And so we just stepped over to a quiet place
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   and I began to share the gospel with him
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.700]   and I couldn't even get to finish the full gospel.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.380]   I got to the part where we started talking about sin
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.220]   and he just began to weep.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.980]   And I said, hey man, what are you crying about?
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.060]   Not like, what are you crying about?
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.480]   No, I'm like, what are you crying about?
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.420]   Walk me through, what's going on?
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.220]   He's like, man, I just don't get it.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.700]   I'm like, what do you not get?
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.320]   And he said, I don't understand
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.860]   how God could ever forgive me, man.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.440]   Man, I'm a drug addict trying to get clean.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.720]   Man, I got the sexual past that'll make you blush.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   Man, I've stolen, cheated, I'm trying to climb
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.680]   the next ladder of success, the next ladder, man,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.700]   just at the expense of running over people.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.240]   And I just said, hey man, Hunter,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.220]   what part of the cross is enough to forgive you, man?
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.960]   The part where Jesus had nails that were pierced
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.560]   in his hands for every time your hands have gone
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   to places that they should never have gone.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.840]   How about the nail on his feet, man?
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.880]   The nail that was pierced in his feet
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.400]   for every time your feet have gone to places
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.040]   that they should never have gone.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.000]   The crown of thorns placed right above his eyes
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.280]   for every time you've looked at things
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   and I've looked at things and thought of things
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.180]   I shouldn't have looked at or thought of.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.720]   The sword that was pierced in his side
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.200]   for every time your heart hardened itself towards God.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.600]   I said, what part of the cross, man,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.920]   is it enough to forgive you?
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.280]   And he just started weeping more.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.120]   I said, there isn't.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.640]   The cross is enough.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.080]   It's sufficient for forgiveness.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.840]   And right then and there, by God's grace,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.800]   nothing I did, man, he calls out to God
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.200]   and he says, God, I need you.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.000]   Will you save me from my sin and from myself?
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.360]   I'm like, what?
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.040]   When did we forget that the gospel's enough?
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.320]   When did we forget that the gospel's enough to save people?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.480]   Listen, I've missed so many opportunities to share
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.360]   because of busyness and fear of rejection
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   of what will happen, discomfort.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   And I just need to build a better relationship.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.700]   Here's what I know.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.760]   The longer that I go without sharing my faith with someone,
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.920]   the greater the odds that I won't share with them.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.760]   Did you catch that?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.240]   The longer that I go or the longer that you go
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   and you just share what you know,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.360]   you don't have to have everything together,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.880]   but the longer you go, the greater the odds
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.780]   that you won't share with that person.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.360]   About a year ago, before I moved here to Dallas,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.600]   I lived in Kansas City.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.440]   And I had some neighbors and they happened to be gay.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.520]   And I just remember, like, God was beating on my chest,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.760]   like, just prompting me day in and day out,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.640]   week in and week out.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.120]   Hey, you need to go talk to them.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.960]   You need to go share.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.400]   Hey, you need to have them over for dinner.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   You need to just build a bridge, talk to them.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.840]   And I just remember saying, no, God,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   like, they're not gonna listen.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.400]   They don't want it, no.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.220]   Like, no.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.480]   And I just rejected it week in and week out,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.160]   day in and day out, year in and year out.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.440]   You know this book that we read
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.480]   every time we have the porch?
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.520]   You know what it says to pray for?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.360]   Boldness.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.720]   Boldness to share.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.840]   See, it's our job to share, but it's God's job to save.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.160]   We share, God saves.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.600]   We share, God saves.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.780]   We don't have to worry about what happens after we share.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.520]   Like, some of you think, man, I'm just gonna screw it up.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.440]   You're not gonna screw it up.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.500]   I promise you.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.720]   People are not gonna go to hell
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.520]   because you didn't say the right thing.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.000]   Like, God can use you in spite of you,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.120]   in spite of you not being eloquent enough
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.920]   or you not having enough information.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.880]   God can use you.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.000]   You just share.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.080]   You just open your mouth.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.280]   It's God's job to save.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.120]   It's our job to share.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   Listen, I see friends getting discouraged
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.240]   when they step out in faith and do share
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.800]   and the person doesn't come to Christ.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.280]   Listen, the scoreboard for evangelism
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.940]   is sharing, not saving.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.800]   That's God's job.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.460]   Rest easy knowing you're faithful.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.280]   D.L. Moody, a great evangelist,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.720]   in other words, he was just a guy
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.440]   that would be out preaching the gospel in the 19th century
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.080]   and thousands and thousands of people
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.960]   would flock to hear him teach.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.200]   A woman came up with him and she had some beef
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   with D.L. Moody and she's like,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.600]   hey, I just need to tell you something.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.020]   I don't like how you share the gospel.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.400]   I don't like how you share the message of Jesus.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.160]   And D.L. Moody, in response, says,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.480]   I kinda don't like how I share it either.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.520]   So maybe you can help me.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.280]   Hey, how do you share it?
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.060]   And she says, I don't.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.880]   To which he said, well, hey, I like how I share it more
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.640]   than I like how you don't share it.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   And I just think that's brilliant.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.640]   Like he just said, hey, well, I like my way
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   of doing it better than your way of not doing it, right?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.380]   And so this is what God is saying to us tonight
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.520]   that as we ask for boldness, hey, the goal is sharing.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.920]   The goal isn't saving.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.040]   The goal is just, hey, open your mouth.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.940]   This is Paul's plea in Romans, or Romans Acts 20, 24,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.360]   where he says, but my life is worth nothing to me
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.880]   unless I use it for finishing the work assigned to me
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.380]   by my Lord Jesus, the work of telling others
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.080]   the good news about his wonderful grace.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.560]   He says, hey, my life is worth nothing.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.720]   I don't account my life of any value.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.440]   It's not precious to myself.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.960]   If only I may finish the course and the ministry
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.440]   that I received from the Lord Jesus.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.320]   What is that ministry?
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.840]   The grace that you and I received
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.240]   when Jesus hung on that cross and paid for our sin.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.960]   So the A stands for ask.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   Ask God for boldness.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.680]   The B stands for build.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.640]   Build bridges to share.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.760]   Build bridges to share.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.040]   The same guy, Paul, in 1 Corinthians 9, 22 through 23
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.160]   says this, to the weak I became weak, to win the weak.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.880]   I have become all things to all people
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.480]   so that by all possible means I might save some.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.340]   I do all this for the sake of the gospel.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.760]   Paul's saying, hey, it's the gospel, it's the good news
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.840]   that motivates me to meet people right where they are,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   to give up my preferences, to put my needs to the side.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   And take up their desires and their needs
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.560]   and to meet the people wherever they are in life.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.000]   The three bridges that we can build with people
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.200]   that I've seen to be effective in my life.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.140]   One of the bridges that we can give people is our time.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.720]   It's to have margin in our day
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.520]   where we can walk slowly through the crowds.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.520]   That we can never be too busy
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.860]   to not allow others to interrupt us.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.580]   Number two is ask questions.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.860]   I love this, questions disarm people.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.020]   They're not ready to box you.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.860]   Like, hey, when you make statements, statements arm people.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.380]   Like, they're ready, like, ooh,
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.900]   I'm about to see where you're going with that.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.260]   And they're gonna jab and they're gonna fight back
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.760]   and they're gonna press.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.940]   But you know what questions do?
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.520]   They just disarm the conversation.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.660]   They build relationships.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.180]   You know how Jesus answered people?
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.340]   He answered them with questions.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   23 times people asked Jesus questions about the kingdom
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.900]   and then he answered them back with questions.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.380]   Listen, I find this to be a really powerful tactic
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.040]   when I'm talking with people.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.780]   Hey, what's your story?
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.140]   Hey, I'm just curious.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.940]   Hey, do you have a faith?
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.040]   Do you know that one question can change the world
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.580]   and it has?
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.820]   Now we're talking.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.440]   Now we've just changed the conversation
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.100]   from the natural to the spiritual.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.020]   Do you have a faith?
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.480]   Hey, I'm just curious.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.580]   If you were to stand before God and he says,
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.660]   why shall I let you into heaven?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.620]   What would you say?
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:45.180]   I get this a lot.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.840]   Well, Josiah, what happens if someone asks me
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.980]   about homosexuality?
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.840]   I don't know, what do you think?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.060]   What do you think about homosexuality?
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.940]   What do you think the Bible says?
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.120]   Gay marriage, what do you think?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.800]   I put the question back in their court.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.820]   Hey, what do you think?
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.380]   Most people wanna talk about themselves.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.420]   What do you think about evolution?
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.260]   Man, I don't know, what do you think?
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.360]   Now we're just talking.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.240]   Now we're just conversing.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.080]   I don't have to have all the answers.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.580]   I don't have to be the know-it-all.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.900]   There's too many of those.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.580]   I just have to care.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.020]   Many of you probably heard this before,
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.560]   but it's called the Columbo tactics.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.920]   It's, hey, what did you mean by that?
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.440]   You're in conversation with someone
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.380]   and they kinda catch you off guard
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.560]   or maybe they say something that just seems wrong.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.700]   It's like, hey, what do you mean by that?
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.900]   How did you come to that conclusion?
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.880]   Hey, have you ever considered,
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.440]   have you ever considered studying the claims of Christ?
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   Have you ever considered why Jesus reset the calendar
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.720]   on your iPhone right now?
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.100]   Have you ever considered?
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.400]   Number three, meet needs of those around you.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.020]   You know, right now, if you live in Dallas,
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   you can go to www.watermark.org/servethecity.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.400]   You can go there right now
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.720]   and you can find all the different needs
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.340]   during this crazy pandemic that we find ourselves in
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.800]   and you can serve the people around you.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.120]   Or, man, you heard JD earlier in the announcement,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.040]   we're coming back, the porch is back.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.760]   You can go to the porch.live/connect
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.720]   and you can jump in with us next week
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.960]   and you can start serving with us.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.720]   You can start that process.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.920]   Listen, when I first came to Christ,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.760]   I didn't just wanna show up and sing a few songs,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.180]   listen to a message and leave.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.320]   Man, if nobody ever called me to engage in the mission,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.980]   the battle that was at hand,
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.800]   the battle of good and evil,
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.400]   sin and darkness,
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.640]   good,
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.360]   heaven and hell.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.120]   Like, if nobody ever called me to do that,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.280]   man, I think I would've found something else
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   to give my life to.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.680]   So let me just share with you how these bridges played out
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.920]   over the last week.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.560]   It was Friday, this past Friday.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   And, man, I was tired.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.920]   The week was just coming to a close
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.440]   and I was ready to get home early
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.920]   and see my wife and hang out with my little girls.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.200]   I have a three and a two-year-old right now.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.660]   And I came across a gentleman.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.300]   And, man, I knew God was calling me
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.020]   to step into this conversation.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.620]   And this guy happened to be transgender.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.300]   A guy who is claiming to be a girl.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.980]   He literally dresses like this.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.820]   He went through the whole surgery.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.740]   And we began to talk and I just said,
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.340]   "Hey, can I get you a cup of coffee?"
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.820]   So I bought him a cup of coffee
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.620]   and we just sat down with a couple other friends
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.100]   and I just said, "Hey, man, what's your story?"
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   "Hey, where'd you grow up?
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.860]   "How did you get here?
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.500]   "How'd you hear about Watermark?"
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.660]   And he began to engage and he began to share
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.860]   and he just said, "Hey, before I go into anything,
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.380]   "I just need you to know that I'm a registered sex offender
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.300]   "who spent 20 years in prison for abusing my daughter."
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.340]   And I just said, "Hey," without batting an eye,
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.740]   I looked at the other two, they didn't bat an eye,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.340]   and we just said, "Hey, thank you for your honesty.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.860]   "We're broken, we're jacked up, we're sinners too,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.960]   "but we know the person who can save us from any sin,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.980]   "and his name is Jesus."
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.140]   And we just began to engage in a conversation.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.220]   And shortly after sharing the gospel with him,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.260]   I just looked at him, I just said,
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.180]   "Hey, do you think you could ever
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:53.240]   "find worth and value in being a man again?"
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.620]   He said, "I don't know, man."
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.100]   He said, "Man, I was abused sexually by my mom
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.600]   "over and over and over, raped by her.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.620]   "Another family member did the same thing to me,
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.420]   "and so I don't want anything to do with being a man.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.580]   "I'm so much more comfortable in being a woman."
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.620]   And I just said, "Hey, I get it, I understand that.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.780]   "You're not crazy for feeling that and thinking that,
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.140]   "but I just want you to consider,
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.240]   "would you consider the God of the universe
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.280]   "who has done so much,
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.840]   "who's putting breath in your lungs,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.440]   "giving you a heart that beats right now,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.380]   "could you consider him placing value
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.280]   "and giving you worth again as a man?"
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.400]   And he said, "I don't know, but I'll consider it."
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.360]   I said, "How about I host you on Sunday at church?"
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.680]   And he came on Sunday, and he sat right up here
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.000]   in the second tier seating,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.920]   and we got to continue the conversation.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.720]   Listen, when did we stop believing
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.360]   that the gospel could change lives?
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.960]   When did we stop believing that this message of Jesus
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.520]   is outdated and antiquated and can't intersect people
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.040]   of all different races and backgrounds
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.560]   and ethnicities and economic status?
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.560]   The gospel's enough.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.540]   The good news of Jesus can intersect any situation.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.880]   So the A stands for ask, ask God for boldness to share.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.360]   The B stands for build, build bridges to share.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.600]   And the C, this stands for carry,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.400]   carry a burden to share, carry a burden to share.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.860]   This word burden just means a difficult situation,
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.160]   a weight, a duty to something,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.460]   a call on your life that you can't shake.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.920]   The same guy we've been talking about all night is Paul,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.960]   and in Romans 9, verse one, this is what he says.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.280]   I speak the truth in Christ.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.400]   I'm not lying.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.680]   My conscience confirms through the Holy Spirit
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.760]   that I have a great sorrow,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.720]   and I have this unceasing anguish in my heart.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.080]   What kind of anguish do you have, Paul?
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.280]   Why do you have this anguish?
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.000]   Where's this sorrow coming from?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.240]   He says this in verse three.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.640]   For I wish I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.560]   for the sake of my people, those of my own race.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.040]   He says, hey, this is what I'm burdened by.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.860]   I'm anguished, I'm in sorrow.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.360]   Did you catch that?
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.200]   He had such a burden for his brothers and sisters
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.360]   that he would go to hell in order for them
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.680]   to be able to go to heaven.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.400]   Paul is saying he has distress,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.640]   and he has pain in his heart for the lost,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.360]   those who are far from Jesus,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.140]   that he wishes he himself could take their hell.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.680]   Listen, I don't know how you get there.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.520]   I'm just being honest.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.480]   I wanna just shoot you straight.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.680]   I'm not there.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   I'm not taking anyone's hell.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.160]   But Paul came to a place in his life
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.280]   where, man, he began to be so burdened for his people
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.920]   that didn't know Christ.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.720]   Let me ask you, have you ever carried a burden
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.740]   with you because life started to get lifey?
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.720]   Have you ever carried a burden
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.440]   or you just became so anguished
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.200]   and you had this sorrow in your body
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.280]   that you couldn't shake
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.960]   because life just started to get lifey?
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.240]   About two and a half years ago,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.920]   my wife and I, Kathy, received a phone call
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.040]   from her sister, Jenny,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.160]   and it's one of those phone calls you never wanna get.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.640]   It was one of those phone calls
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.360]   where we knew that she was going in for some tests
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.240]   and we didn't know everything that was going on in her body
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.960]   and neither did she, but she called us
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.200]   and I remember like it's yesterday.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.040]   And she said, "Hey, I have some news
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.200]   "that I wanna share with you."
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.080]   And on the other side of the phone,
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.260]   we began to listen in and she says,
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:56.040]   "I just found out that I have cancer, in colon cancer."
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.280]   She's 33 years old at the time
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.040]   and she found out that she had colon cancer
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.960]   and I remember in that moment
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.120]   just feeling this unbelievable weight come over
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.240]   my life personally, my marriage, my family,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.160]   because of what my sister-in-law, Jenny, was going through.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.400]   And I remember jumping on the phone
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.000]   with her husband, Alex, shortly after
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.540]   and I remember just sitting there
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.440]   trying to listen and help him process all the emotions
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.520]   and the flood of feelings that come with the word cancer.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.680]   Some of you get it, some of you maybe have had cancer,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.640]   your loved one has gone through cancer.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.000]   And I remember just listening to Alex
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   on the other side of the phone
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.640]   and I just remember him saying,
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.460]   "Josiah," as he was weeping, he just said,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.800]   "Josiah, I know where this is headed.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.100]   "I know what's going on, I understand where this is going.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.820]   "Like she's gonna have to go under the knife
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.500]   "and they're gonna have to remove the tumor
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.340]   "and I want so badly, I want so badly
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.340]   "for me to be that guy, I wanna take her place
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.360]   "and I want that tumor to be in me
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.860]   "so that I can be the one to go under the knife
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.060]   "and have the surgery."
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.280]   And then he said, "I just want to be able to be the one
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.740]   "to go through the chemo.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.960]   "I wanna be the one to take on this weight
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.200]   "that my wife is having to carry."
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.860]   He was so burdened by it that he would do anything
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.740]   to stop it if it was in his ability to take it on himself.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.260]   And in the same way, Paul is saying,
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.100]   "Hey, I see where this is headed
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.080]   "for every person who lives their life
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.500]   "without following Jesus and then dies
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.660]   "and ends up in hell for all of eternity."
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.280]   And listen, I know hell isn't a popular subject
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.380]   to talk about.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:46.380]   But my plea tonight is that if God allowed sin
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.740]   into heaven, what would heaven look like?
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.820]   It would look a lot like this world broken
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.220]   and shattered and jacked up so he can't,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.020]   because he's holy, he's perfect.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.300]   And so he must assess the penalty for your sin and my sin.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.960]   I remember understanding this weight
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.660]   as I read Romans 9, one through three,
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.300]   and this burden that Paul carried
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.660]   because of the eternity that his brothers and sisters
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.160]   would face if they lived their entire life
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.360]   apart from Christ.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.780]   And it moved Paul to a place of love
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.220]   and compassion for people.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.820]   It shouldn't move us to a place where we hang out
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.500]   on the corner of the street and hold up signs,
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.960]   turn or burn, you've seen those people on megaphones
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.320]   and they're just unhelpful at best.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.000]   It does more harm than good,
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.980]   but it should move us to a place of love and compassion.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.520]   In the same way, Paul says, I'm willing to give up
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.480]   my place in heaven if that meant for someone else
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:05.200]   to take my place in heaven.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.480]   I'm willing to give up my place in heaven
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   and I'll take their place in hell.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.640]   Wow, I read that, I'm just like, Lord,
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.380]   you got ground to take in my heart.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.900]   You got work to do in this body.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:23.380]   Listen, when was the last time you were burdened
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.080]   to share Jesus with your lost friends,
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.120]   your coworkers, your neighbors, complete strangers?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.360]   And not just burden, but it led you to action.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.300]   Listen, I know it's hard.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.400]   Listen, I'm not standing up here thinking
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.600]   that it's just easy and just go do it.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.360]   Pull your bootstraps up and white knuckle this.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.900]   No, it's a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.320]   (soft music)
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:52.280]   I'm proposing tonight that you would start with praying,
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.360]   'cause this is what I know, man.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.060]   We'll never be burdened for what we're not praying for.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.340]   That you would pray that prayer, God make me bold.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.200]   Before you step into an environment,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.400]   whether it's the restaurant that you're gonna eat at tonight
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.400]   or the office that you're gonna walk into
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.320]   tomorrow, that you would just say a simple prayer.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.300]   God make me bold.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.420]   God, I'm available.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:27.700]   As I close, you know what else is crazy
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.460]   about my sister-in-law, Jenny?
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.160]   She was also pregnant at the time.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.740]   Pregnant with her first child.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.000]   And the doctors and the medical team, some of them,
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.060]   came up to her after she was diagnosed and they said,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.140]   "Hey, we believe it's in your best interest
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:48.460]   "to abort this child.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:54.760]   "Because that would save your life.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.320]   "Because you're gonna have to go through radiation
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.180]   "if you're gonna defeat this cancer."
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.300]   Like you're not gonna defeat this cancer
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.860]   apart from going through this radiation.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.600]   And I don't know if you know much about the medical field,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.880]   but you can't go through radiation when you're pregnant.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   You can go through chemo, but you can't go through radiation.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.600]   And she just looked at him and she just said,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.460]   "Hey, I understand.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.180]   "That's kind of logical, I get that.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.160]   "But I'm a Christian and I believe the life in my womb
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.360]   "is just as important as my life.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.820]   "And I'm gonna trust God in this.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.000]   "And listen, I'm not gonna abort the baby.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.240]   "And we're gonna trust God.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:51.560]   "Even if it costs my life.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.300]   "Even if it's uncomfortable."
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.120]   See, I'm willing to put my risk in order to save
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.140]   the child that's in me.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.040]   That's what she was saying in a sense.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.020]   Even if there's all sort of complication and risk later on,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.440]   she had a mission.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.300]   And that mission was to save her child's life.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.860]   In the same way, Jesus had another mission.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.140]   And that mission was to seek and save the lost.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.820]   He gave up the comforts of heaven,
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.820]   the conveniences that he had in heaven.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.540]   And he took up a cross here on earth
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.040]   because he was on a rescue mission for you and for me.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.420]   Because the cross is the only sufficient payment
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.820]   for your sin and my sin.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.380]   Somebody had to die and an imperfect person couldn't die
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.780]   for imperfect people.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.620]   It had to be a perfect substitute.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:50.620]   And the only one that's walked this earth
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.660]   and has been perfect and thoughtward in action is Jesus.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.100]   And if you're not a Christian,
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.860]   listen, there's a reason why you go to bed every night.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.280]   And you ask that question, is that it?
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.020]   Is that all life is?
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.500]   That if you're not a Christian,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.220]   you know that enough is never really enough.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.740]   There's this hole inside of your heart
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.140]   that you're looking to fulfill
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.700]   and you think you're gonna satisfy it
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.940]   with climbing the corporate
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.140]   and making a million dollars by the time you're 30.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.580]   You're gonna find Mr. Right
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.740]   and you guys are gonna find that house
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.240]   with the white picket fence.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.620]   And you're gonna have that perfect family,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.620]   which there isn't one, newsflash.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:41.220]   And you're gonna chase one thing after another,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.860]   after another, only to find that it's never enough.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:50.100]   You can have everything in this world
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.960]   and still miss out on what life's all about.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.820]   And for others of you, man, you know the hope of Christ,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.360]   but what are you doing with it?
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.180]   Wake up, get on mission.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.260]   You have been placed here in Dallas, Texas
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.500]   or somewhere else that you're tuning in tonight
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.620]   and God has given you everything you need,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.580]   your time, your talents, your treasures,
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.900]   your relationship, your job, your good looks,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.580]   your smarts, your days off, your breakups,
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.620]   your pain, your wins, your joys in life,
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.900]   everything he has given you
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.980]   so that you would leverage and that you would use it
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.700]   to know him and to make him known.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.160]   And that's my prayer for you tonight.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.820]   You pray that you would.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.820]   God in heaven, we need you.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:48.460]   As I pray this prayer, I think about my own inadequacies.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:56.740]   God, I think about the times where
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.260]   I've got it right and I think about the times
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.140]   I've got it wrong.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.180]   And in no way do I ever wanna stand up here
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.620]   and think that I have it all together.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.100]   I'm broken, I'm a sinner in need of you every day.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.700]   The gospel, the good news of Jesus
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.560]   was just as important to me today.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.260]   It's just as relevant for me today as it was
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.260]   15 years ago when I gave my life to you.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.340]   So God, I pray that we would be men and women
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.340]   who ask you for boldness,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.660]   who build bridges to share,
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.700]   and who carry a burden to share.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.640]   And God, you would use us in spite of us for your glory,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.300]   for our joy, and for the world's good.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.100]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
