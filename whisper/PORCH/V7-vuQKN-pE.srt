1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,500
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,420
 Self-care continues.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,180
 Welcome, friends in the room.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,400
 And yes, happy Valentine's Day week.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,060
 Singles Awareness Day is coming up.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,980
 And we are continuing this series, Self-Care.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,220
 Anyone been to New York City recently?

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,720
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,140
 Man, concrete jungle where dreams are made of.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,720
 New York during the winter is like one of the best times

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
 to go to that city.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,740
 And it's such a fun city.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,600
 We went not long ago, my wife and I.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,620
 And we did, of course, what you do when you go to New York

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,120
 and you're doing all the touristy things.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,080
 And so we stayed in the Lower East Side.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,720
 We went and saw a show, went to Times Square.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,440
 We went and saw the Christmas tree

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
 and just had a blast going around

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,860
 getting to experience all that was New York.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,080
 But one of my favorite parts of our trip,

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,800
 I didn't expect to be one of my favorite parts,

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,680
 and that was the subway station.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
 Any subway travelers?

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,160
 Like, dude, here's a couple things.

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,480
 Yeah, thank you, good.

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
 You're in Dallas.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
 Here's what I love about the subway station experience

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,780
 is one, it's like unbelievably cheap.

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,040
 It's like for a nickel, you can go all around the city

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
 as many times as you want.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,440
 And it's like $2.20 compared to an Uber.

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,720
 It's unbelievable.

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,080
 And there's something just that feels like,

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,660
 hey, I'm a real New Yorker.

37
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,720
 I'm like kinda in this little box right now

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,780
 with everyone that is like,

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,680
 it's essentially who I see at the DMV,

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,900
 all in one, we're getting a reunion together.

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,480
 We're hanging out in there and here we are,

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,160
 we're riding around, holding onto the thing

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
 and just had like a blast

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,200
 'cause it almost feels like you're going on the scavenger hunt

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,840
 every time of like, hey, where do we go now?

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,800
 Do we take the F train?

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
 Do we take the A train?

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
 What do we do?

49
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,960
 And throughout that experience,

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,440
 there were different times where because

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,680
 I wasn't that familiar with the train

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,960
 and I would think I'm getting onto one train

53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
 and I would make the mistake

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,540
 and I thought we were going to Soho

55
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,620
 or we're going to Chelsea or we're going to Brooklyn

56
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,840
 and we ended up heading toward Queens

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,760
 and you don't realize it till you get close to it.

58
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,880
 You're like, I don't think this is where

59
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
 we're supposed to be right now.

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,380
 And what do you do in that situation?

61
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,540
 You're like, well, I gotta get off.

62
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,600
 I gotta figure out which train I need to be on

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,720
 and make sure that I get on the right train.

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,240
 Now, what does that have to do with self-care?

65
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,720
 Well, in a very similar way is the idea of,

66
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,320
 hey, if you get on the wrong train,

67
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,020
 it's going to take you to the wrong destination.

68
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,960
 So it is with our thoughts.

69
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,880
 Like the thoughts that you have are not just,

70
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,440
 hey, one and done, I had this thought and then it's done.

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,480
 If you allow that thought to stay in your mind

72
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,280
 and you continue, it will invite other thoughts like it

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,520
 and it will lead you towards a destination.

74
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
 We even have a term for this.

75
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,780
 What's it called?

76
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,560
 Train of thought.

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
 They're like, hey, our thoughts

78
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,060
 are not just an individual one-off,

79
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,280
 they're a train of thoughts that can be a part of them.

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,520
 And unlike anything else in your life,

81
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
 what you think about and your mind

82
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,600
 is gonna impact the person that you become.

83
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,920
 And so if you don't have the ability

84
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,580
 to really control the trains of thoughts

85
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,960
 that are trying to get you and the ability to,

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,040
 hey, I need to get off this train of thought right now

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,120
 'cause it's making me freak out

88
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,140
 and I need to get on that train over there,

89
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,640
 you will live a life that you are no longer in control.

90
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,720
 And so we're gonna talk about tonight

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
 what it looks like to control the mind.

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
 But before I do, you know what I mean by like,

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,420
 the mind can be so powerful and it can just lead you

94
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,080
 and all of a sudden one thought leads to another

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
 that leads to another and you've jumped on this train

96
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,240
 and it is heading towards the destination

97
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,060
 that you don't wanna be at.

98
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,900
 What do I mean by that?

99
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,920
 Like here's some examples that I wrote out.

100
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,360
 I called this the step on the WebMD train

101
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,400
 where all of a sudden you have like a sore back

102
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,420
 and you're like, man, what could this be?

103
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,080
 And I go into WebMD, I pull up the app,

104
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,700
 I like put in the symptoms and everything that comes up

105
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,920
 is like it could be an appendicitis rupture,

106
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
 kidney failure or cancer is in all of them.

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,640
 And you're like, oh man, that is not good.

108
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
 And all of a sudden you're like scheduling

109
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,560
 doctor's appointments to go see,

110
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
 because hey, I need to go see a doctor

111
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,040
 'cause I think my kidneys are failing right now.

112
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,260
 I have cancer, back cancer.

113
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,000
 I didn't even know that happened, but that's what I have.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
 Or here's another train, the reading into things

115
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
 in a dating relationship train.

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,380
 Where you're dating someone and you know,

117
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,640
 you're having gone on a few dates, things are going good.

118
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,160
 Maybe you're the girl there, he's dropping you off

119
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,260
 and you're a few dates in and he drops you off

120
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,560
 and he's like, hey, I had a nice time.

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,600
 And then he gives you a side hug and you're like,

122
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
 what does nice time mean?

123
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
 And side hug, really?

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,420
 You give me a side hug?

125
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,480
 And so you begin to play the train.

126
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,980
 You're sitting there like, I don't even know

127
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,840
 if this guy likes me.

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000
 He didn't think I'm attractive.

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,880
 I bet he likes Sarah is what's going on.

130
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
 He's probably gonna break this up.

131
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,380
 You know, I'm gonna break it off with him

132
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,440
 before he breaks it off with me,

133
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,280
 'cause that's what I'm gonna do.

134
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,240
 And you just go crazy 'cause you follow the train of thought

135
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,080
 or, oh man, it's so true.

136
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
 It all made a little crazy.

137
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
 Or maybe it's like with your boss.

138
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
 I don't know if you've been here,

139
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,280
 but you send an email to your boss

140
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,920
 and you don't get a response.

141
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,040
 And you're like, huh, no response.

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,800
 I wonder if he got the email.

143
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
 Of course he got the email.

144
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,440
 You can not get the email.

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
 We work at the same company.

146
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,880
 It's not like it went to spam.

147
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
 He must have not liked my idea.

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I bet he probably doesn't like me.

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,920
 I bet I'm next on the chopping block for a job.

150
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,640
 I need to update my LinkedIn profile.

151
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,960
 I don't even know my LinkedIn password.

152
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,800
 Man, I gotta find a new career.

153
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
 And all of a sudden, just from one thought,

154
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,040
 and it's probably irrational.

155
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,840
 Usually it's irrational and it has nothing to do

156
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,120
 with the boss was like, oh, it was off yesterday.

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
 And you just lose your mind

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
 'cause you follow the train of thought.

159
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,640
 And that can happen in little ways

160
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,720
 and it can happen in big ways.

161
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,800
 But regardless, if you and I cannot learn

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,320
 the ability to get off of that thought train,

163
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,480
 then you and I are gonna not only not have control

164
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
 of our thoughts, you won't have control

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
 over the life that you're gonna live

166
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,880
 because nothing within your control

167
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
 and your thoughts are in your control.

168
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
 And we're gonna talk about for the next really 30 minutes

169
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,440
 about how you can step off of that thought train.

170
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,680
 But nothing that is in your control,

171
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,920
 like your thoughts will impact your life

172
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
 or your thoughts more than anything else

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
 that is within your control.

174
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
 You can't control all the circumstances you face,

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
 everything that you're gonna face in life,

176
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,720
 but you can control your thoughts and how you react to them.

177
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
 And here is why this is so important

178
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,760
 because it's pretty easy.

179
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,480
 Whenever you're on the A train in Brooklyn

180
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,200
 and you need to get off and get on the other train,

181
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,040
 I know how to do it.

182
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
 I just wait until the doors open.

183
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,760
 I step off, I look at the chart and I'm like,

184
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,120
 all right, I need to go here.

185
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,440
 It's not as easy or intuitive

186
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,680
 to get off some of the thought trains that we can get on.

187
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,640
 So tonight, as we continue self-care,

188
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,200
 we are gonna talk about winning the battle of the mind.

189
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
 This series has been a look at what does it look like

190
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,400
 to care for yourself biblically

191
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,520
 in terms of mind, body, spirit.

192
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,160
 And so we're gonna cover body in a couple of weeks.

193
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,320
 We're covering all these different issues

194
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,720
 about what does it look like to care for yourself.

195
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,440
 And tonight we're gonna talk about what it looks like

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,200
 in regards to the mind,

197
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,520
 specifically how you can win the battle of the mind.

198
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,760
 So we're gonna look at three principles.

199
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,600
 If you take notes,

200
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,240
 we're looking at three things

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,320
 that if you wanna win the battle for your mind

202
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,560
 have got to be a part of the way that you think.

203
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 So three truths about filling your mind

204
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
 with the right things

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,760
 or really just winning the battle of your mind.

206
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,120
 The first truth comes from 2 Corinthians 10.

207
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,280
 We're in it.

208
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,760
 Corinthians, if you have your Bible, you flip open.

209
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,800
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians.

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
 If not, it'll be on the screen.

211
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,040
 Corinthians was written by the Apostle Paul,

212
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
 formerly known as Saul.

213
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,640
 And he wrote this book to the Corinthian church.

214
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,920
 And in it, he lays out as it relates to thinking

215
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,960
 some of the things that they're to do.

216
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 Here's what he says.

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,640
 "For though we live in this world,

218
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,160
 "we do not wage war as the world does.

219
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,120
 "The weapons that we fight with

220
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,400
 "are not the weapons of the world.

221
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,360
 "On the contrary, they have divine power

222
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,080
 "to demolish strongholds."

223
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,680
 That same word strongholds is translated prisons.

224
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
 "That the things that we fight with,"

225
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
 and he's gonna allude,

226
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
 he's really talking about truth,

227
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,560
 "have the power to unlock people from prison."

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
 From the prisons that their decisions have made,

229
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
 the prisons that they can find themselves

230
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
 in their own minds creating,

231
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
 that's the power that we have in Christ through truth.

232
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
 "We demolish arguments and every pretension

233
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,480
 "that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.

234
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,360
 "And we take captive or we capture and arrest."

235
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,900
 It's the same word in Greek translated.

236
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,120
 "Every thought and we make it obedient to Christ."

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,600
 So Paul says that as followers of Jesus,

238
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,420
 as it relates to the thoughts that we have,

239
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,680
 you are to take every thought captive

240
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
 and you're to arrest it and make sure

241
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,820
 that it is in line with what God says,

242
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,760
 with what is true,

243
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,600
 and you use the truth to combat the lies the enemy feeds you

244
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
 and the way that you fight the battle of the mind

245
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,680
 involves taking captive the thoughts that you have

246
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
 and aligning them with truth

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,780
 and getting rid of any of the toxic thoughts that you have.

248
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,040
 The first idea I wanna talk about from this text

249
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,960
 and really the Bible in general

250
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,040
 is that if you wanna experience freedom

251
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,400
 and really win the battle of your mind,

252
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,240
 you have got to remove toxic thinking.

253
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 Remove toxic thinking.

254
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,760
 All of us came in the room tonight,

255
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,360
 all of us have had thoughts fill our minds that are toxic.

256
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,000
 They are not in line with God's word

257
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,600
 and you have to capture or arrest those thoughts.

258
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,480
 And thoughts like that are gonna pop up,

259
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,020
 they're negative thoughts, they're anxious thoughts,

260
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,080
 they're lustful thoughts, all kinds of different thoughts.

261
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,120
 And they're thoughts that God would say,

262
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,420
 "Hey, those things are gonna pop in your head,

263
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,400
 "but it is your choice over whether you will dwell on them."

264
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,500
 And as a believer in Christ, you grab those thoughts,

265
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,600
 you say, "I'm choosing not to dwell on you.

266
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,960
 "I'm choosing not to dwell on you."

267
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,600
 Then we remove toxic thoughts.

268
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,160
 Basically, we audit our mind and evaluate

269
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
 as we think about what we're thinking about.

270
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,760
 Hey, what is this thought?

271
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
 Is this from God?

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,120
 Is this what he would want me to be thinking right now?

273
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
 And anything that's not,

274
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,280
 I'm gonna remove that from my mind.

275
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,980
 I'm gonna talk about what some of those things are.

276
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,860
 But it's not dissimilar to this.

277
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,880
 Whenever you go to the airport a few weeks ago,

278
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,400
 you have to go through what?

279
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,240
 Security.

280
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,120
 You gotta go through TSA,

281
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,040
 you gotta go, you gotta take off all your shoes

282
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,720
 and go through and make sure you don't have a belt on

283
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
 and make sure there's nothing hazardous or dangerous

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,140
 or sharp or explosive inside of the bags that you have.

285
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,020
 I was with a friend, he was coming with me

286
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,000
 for a speaking opportunity in Missouri

287
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,360
 and he just kinda tagged along and his bag got flagged.

288
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,540
 And they pulled his bag aside.

289
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,240
 And usually you're thinking like,

290
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,760
 man, did I bring a shampoo bottle that's too big?

291
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,380
 Like, come on guys, this is taking too long,

292
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
 can we just get out of here?

293
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,060
 And the guy pulls him aside, he says,

294
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,460
 "Hey, there's a knife in your bag."

295
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,280
 And he's like, "A knife?

296
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
 "I don't even know what you're talking about."

297
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,920
 And he says, "Well, do you know if it's a double-edged knife

298
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
 "or a two-sided knife?"

299
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,720
 And he's like, "Honestly, I'm not sure."

300
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,660
 And he said, "Well, if it is, there's a significant fine

301
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,160
 "and you will not be able to go forward."

302
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,000
 And I'm like, dude, let's hope that it isn't.

303
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,520
 Good luck, buddy, 'cause every man for himself after this.

304
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,160
 And the guy pulls it out and he begins to look at it

305
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,280
 and thank goodness it was just a pocket knife.

306
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,120
 But it was one of those things where TSA,

307
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,460
 Security in General, says, "Hey, there are certain items

308
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,900
 "that we are not allowing to come in here,

309
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,160
 "whether they're hazardous, toxic, or dangerous,

310
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,900
 "like knives or guns and things like that."

311
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,320
 The Apostle Paul says, "When it comes to your mind,

312
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,620
 "you have got to be the security checkpoint.

313
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,540
 "You will not allow knives or negative thoughts

314
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,060
 "or things that are not from God,

315
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,180
 "things that are not biblical,

316
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,660
 "things that are not true to come into your mind."

317
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,020
 As soon as you identify those things,

318
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,180
 you're saying, "I'm not going to dwell on this thing."

319
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
 And here's why this matters for you.

320
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,740
 Because so many of the knives that you allow

321
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,700
 and I allow into our minds,

322
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,240
 they're a little bit like those hidden pocket knives

323
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,520
 you didn't even realize were there.

324
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,400
 In other words, just like when you go through security,

325
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,940
 rarely is someone caught and like,

326
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,780
 "Oh man, I didn't even realize I brought a bomb, who knew?"

327
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,620
 Generally, they're like,

328
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,280
 "Oh man, I forgot about the pocket knife."

329
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,120
 Yeah, you can keep it.

330
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,560
 In the same way, there are toxic thoughts

331
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,320
 that you think every day, they seem harmless.

332
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,780
 You may not even realize you're doing it

333
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,380
 'cause it's just so natural.

334
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,940
 And they are things that Paul would say, "That's a knife."

335
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,100
 You need to confiscate it and remove it from your thinking.

336
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,020
 You cannot choose all the different thoughts

337
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,540
 that are gonna pop up from time to time,

338
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,300
 but you can choose what you are going to dwell on.

339
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,820
 So let me give you some of the toxic ones

340
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,580
 that I think I've experienced,

341
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,700
 a really common experience for all of us.

342
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,820
 Anyone ever found themselves

343
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,400
 like not believing the best about someone?

344
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,940
 Toxic thought.

345
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,300
 When I'm going, "Oh my gosh, yeah,

346
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,340
 "I can't believe that they did that.

347
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,180
 "They always do that.

348
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,340
 "That's just, they're a bad apple.

349
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,620
 "That's the type of person they are."

350
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,540
 Toxic thought, Paul would say, "That's a knife."

351
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,380
 You've got to remove that from your thinking.

352
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,840
 You've got to choose to believe the best.

353
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,020
 When you can't, you expose it and say,

354
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,460
 "I can't believe the best right now."

355
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,300
 Toxic thought.

356
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,120
 Here's another one.

357
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,900
 If you found yourself obsessing over

358
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,660
 why you didn't get invited on that trip,

359
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,680
 obsessing over why you weren't invited to that dinner,

360
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,580
 toxic thought, you'd say, "Remove it."

361
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,980
 Another one that can be common is just,

362
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,820
 if you've ever found yourself living in what I would say

363
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,460
 is kind of the what if mentality, which is just fear,

364
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,780
 but it's like, "Oh my goodness, what if I never get married?

365
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,120
 "What if my mom doesn't recover?

366
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,580
 "What if I lose my job?"

367
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
 Toxic thought.

368
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,940
 You've got to identify it, remove it,

369
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,560
 say, "I'm not going to dwell on that.

370
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,080
 "This will not control me.

371
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,880
 "I am taking back control over the thoughts that I have."

372
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,660
 Another one, dwelling on your appearance

373
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,320
 or really wishing that you looked like someone else.

374
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,140
 And when you look in the mirror,

375
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,820
 and it's never that blatant, like, "Oh my gosh, it's you."

376
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,860
 It's never popping up on your shoulder, talking to you.

377
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,820
 It's just this looming thought of,

378
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,120
 "Man, I don't like who I am."

379
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,780
 Knife, toxic thought.

380
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,280
 You've got to remove it.

381
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,120
 You've got to remove it.

382
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,380
 And we're gonna talk a little bit about how

383
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,980
 and what that exactly looks like,

384
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,340
 but you are either gonna take your thoughts captive,

385
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,980
 like he says here,

386
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,540
 or your thoughts are gonna take you captive.

387
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,820
 And here's the thing that I don't know,

388
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,860
 no matter how hard I try to convince you,

389
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,660
 many of you will not believe me.

390
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,940
 You can control the thoughts that you think,

391
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,940
 the thoughts that you dwell on.

392
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,500
 Our world around us says, "Hey, you can't control that,

393
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,180
 "and you're not in the driver's seat.

394
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,980
 "It relates to what you think about."

395
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,100
 You can control what you think about.

396
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,740
 Paul just said, "We take every thought captive."

397
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,900
 Our thoughts don't take us captive.

398
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,740
 I am choosing.

399
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,780
 I will not be owned by this.

400
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,860
 And we're gonna talk a little bit more

401
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,740
 about what those things and how we can experience

402
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,620
 taking control back from our thoughts.

403
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,340
 But let me just do this before we move on.

404
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,420
 Let's just audit a little bit

405
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,220
 some of the thoughts that we have,

406
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,540
 because if you're inside of the room,

407
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,380
 the thoughts that you have every single day

408
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,540
 are shaping the person that you are becoming.

409
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,220
 They are taking you to a destination.

410
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,500
 You're getting on a train.

411
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,060
 So let's think in the last 24 hours,

412
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,300
 I wrote out three categories or scenarios.

413
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,900
 As it relates to the thought that you have,

414
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,700
 the thoughts that you've had in the last 24 hours,

415
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,260
 here's a question for you.

416
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,860
 Were the thoughts you had over the past 24 hours,

417
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,060
 were they more worried thoughts or peaceful thoughts?

418
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,500
 The last 24 hours.

419
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,860
 Were they more worried or peaceful?

420
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,020
 The thoughts over the last 24 hours,

421
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,340
 were they more negative or positive?

422
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,620
 Was they more prone to negatively interpret,

423
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,140
 to step on that negative train?

424
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,380
 And when you step on that train,

425
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,780
 it just goes further and further,

426
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,940
 further down the negative road.

427
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,540
 Everything else, it gets worse and worse and worse.

428
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,140
 Were the thoughts over the last 24 hours,

429
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,460
 were they more worldly or eternal?

430
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,340
 It is impossible to live a positive life

431
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,500
 with negative thinking.

432
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
 Is it impossible?

433
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,980
 It is impossible to live an eternal,

434
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,620
 an eternal mindset life with worldly thinking.

435
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,900
 And it is impossible to live a life filled with peace,

436
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,100
 with anxious thoughts and anxious thinking.

437
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,980
 And the Apostle Paul says,

438
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,460
 "You've gotta take those things captive.

439
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,780
 "You remove every single toxic thought."

440
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,340
 Some of you, this means you've got to remove

441
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,220
 some of the things in your life

442
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,900
 that are fueling the toxic thoughts.

443
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,340
 Like here's the true story.

444
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,780
 There are friends that you have,

445
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,020
 let's say you struggle with anxiety,

446
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,060
 let's say you struggle with lust,

447
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,300
 let's say you struggle with whatever it is.

448
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,740
 There are friends inside of the room,

449
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,660
 friends in your life, maybe they're not here tonight,

450
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,140
 maybe they're just in your life in general,

451
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,220
 and they're not helping you get off the wrong train

452
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,260
 and get on the right one.

453
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,700
 They're helping you stay on the right train.

454
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
 They're like, "Dude, we're on the train to anxiety

455
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,300
 "and let's just feed off of one another

456
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,500
 "and I can't believe it, or the train of jealousy,

457
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,020
 "and let's just feed off of one another,

458
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,440
 "the train of gossip.

459
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,860
 "Let's just feed off of one another."

460
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,380
 And you gotta make sure you don't have people around you

461
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,140
 that are pulling you on that train.

462
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,160
 The other thing is just the things that you're consuming.

463
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,100
 The things that you're consuming

464
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 are filling your mind with those thoughts,

465
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,740
 and those thoughts are a train that lead to a destination.

466
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,900
 What are some examples of that?

467
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,740
 Pornography, we talk about all the time.

468
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,420
 That if you fill your mind with lustful thoughts,

469
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,380
 it's going to take you in the direction of a destination

470
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,040
 of lust-filled desires and acting out on those things,

471
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,420
 of being unable to experience what God's desire

472
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,040
 and plan for sexuality really is.

473
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,220
 If you fill your mind with,

474
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
 there's so many different things,

475
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,780
 and some of them are not even that blatant.

476
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,100
 Some of you need to get off social media

477
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,460
 because every time you get on there,

478
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,500
 you're filled with thoughts about how much you don't have

479
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,340
 and how much you don't have,

480
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,420
 and I can't believe that she,

481
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,100
 and you're insecure about what you look like

482
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,860
 because she always posts these pictures

483
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,760
 in these short skirts, dresses,

484
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,940
 whatever girls wear, okay?

485
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,660
 (congregation laughing)

486
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
 Some of you need to get off dating apps, like for real.

487
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,060
 Like you're on dating apps, and you're a different person.

488
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,940
 You're checking it every three seconds.

489
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,580
 You're like, oh my gosh, did he like me again?

490
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,860
 And I can't believe that he didn't like me.

491
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,240
 I've liked him five times.

492
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,160
 And you need to get off of it because it is changing you,

493
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,020
 and you are filling your mind with things

494
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,580
 that are distracting you,

495
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,060
 and you need to take those thoughts captive,

496
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,220
 and one of the ways you take them captive

497
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,260
 is by saying, hey, I'm not gonna consume that stuff.

498
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,060
 Some of it's like neutral, like Narcos,

499
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,740
 or just shows on Netflix where you're like,

500
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,780
 hey, it's just filling my mind with bad things.

501
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,940
 I'm more anxious because of the things that I'm consuming.

502
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,780
 So Paul says, in order to experience

503
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
 and win the battle in your mind,

504
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,100
 it's gotta include removing toxic thoughts from your life.

505
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,740
 The second step he lays out in Philippians chapter four,

506
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,240
 book of Philippians, Paul writes from a jail cell.

507
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,460
 And so he writes out these words,

508
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,060
 and he's arrested for his faith,

509
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,220
 and he's thrown in a jail cell.

510
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,540
 He's chained to a Roman prisoner, I'm sorry, a Roman guard,

511
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,020
 and he writes out these different words

512
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,460
 to the Philippian church.

513
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,500
 It says this, "Finally, brothers and sisters,

514
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,160
 "whatever is true, whatever is noble,

515
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,580
 "whatever is right, whatever is pure,

516
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,320
 "whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable,

517
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,520
 "if anything is excellent or praiseworthy,

518
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,920
 "think about such things."

519
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,500
 Paul says, "Fix your attention on these things."

520
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,420
 That there's not only stuff that we need to get rid of

521
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,780
 in our life, and we're gonna arrest that,

522
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,860
 and that's not coming in.

523
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,500
 There's also things that we need to fill

524
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,940
 and dwell on over and over and over again.

525
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,060
 Rehearse and replay in our mind.

526
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,620
 He says, "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, right,

527
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,360
 "whatever is pure, lovely, admirable,"

528
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,300
 which is just like full of worship or worthy of worship.

529
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,420
 You could say heavenly.

530
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,900
 It says, "Begin to think about these things.

531
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
 "Think about what is true.

532
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,320
 "Think about who God is.

533
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,340
 "Think about the truths that are contained in God's word."

534
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,040
 Those are the things to dwell on.

535
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,060
 And not fill your mind with toxic thoughts.

536
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,660
 The second idea is to replace the lies with the truth.

537
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,340
 If you wanna win the battle of the mind,

538
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,820
 it involves replacing the lies with the truth.

539
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,060
 I need to identify when I am beginning to believe a lie.

540
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,860
 I am wanting to get on this train.

541
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,140
 And I need to have others around me,

542
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,920
 and really take the steps to replace the lie with the truth.

543
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,000
 Imagine what your life would look like

544
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,540
 if you really applied these verses.

545
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,660
 Imagine what today would've looked like

546
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
 if everywhere that you went,

547
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,980
 every thought that you had at work,

548
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,340
 you're sitting there, you're making widgets

549
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,420
 or whatever you do for a job,

550
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,460
 and you're doing Excel spreadsheets,

551
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,500
 and you're just sitting there,

552
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,980
 and the only things that filled your mind were like,

553
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,100
 man, God is so good, I'm so thankful,

554
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,220
 it's another day, I'm alive, God is for me,

555
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,420
 he put me here on purpose, he is at work in my life,

556
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,740
 he's gonna complete the good works

557
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,860
 that he started inside of me,

558
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,340
 he's never gonna leave me, forsake me,

559
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,520
 all these things, these are what flooded your mind.

560
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,620
 How filled with peace would you be?

561
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,960
 How unfrustrated would you be

562
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,720
 when a coworker interrupts you or annoys you

563
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,320
 or does that thing that typically annoys you?

564
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,600
 How much of your life would change?

565
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,380
 How much of your self-talk,

566
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,880
 the things that you say to yourself, would change?

567
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,160
 If you really filled your mind with these things,

568
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,440
 like those are the things I'm gonna dwell on,

569
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,180
 if it's not that, nope, thank you, next, we are moving on.

570
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,880
 (congregation laughing)

571
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,680
 I mean, think about it.

572
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 And the Apostle Paul says,

573
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,320
 man, think and dwell on these things.

574
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,800
 There should be nothing in your life that you dwell on.

575
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
 It may pop in, you may think on it,

576
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,500
 nothing you dwell on that is not here,

577
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,800
 that is not found in God's word,

578
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,880
 that's not from the truth that we see in God's word.

579
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,800
 I don't know what lies you're tempted to believe

580
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,820
 that you need to replace with truth.

581
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,640
 I can tell you one of the biggest ones for me

582
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,040
 is the lie that, man, David,

583
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,840
 you are never gonna be good enough.

584
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,860
 No matter how hard you try, you are gonna fail.

585
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,580
 And you are a failure, you'll always be a failure,

586
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,420
 and you'll never be good enough.

587
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,260
 And you know what, you can work really hard at work,

588
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,860
 and you're gonna fail your family.

589
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,440
 Or you could be amazing with your family,

590
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
 and you're gonna fail at work.

591
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,100
 You're never gonna be good enough.

592
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,180
 Here's why that lie is so powerful for me.

593
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,740
 Because there's truth in it.

594
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,180
 I'm never gonna be good enough.

595
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,480
 I am not good enough, I'm not enough on my own.

596
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,180
 And there's a small bit of truth,

597
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,300
 but it's only half the truth.

598
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,780
 Because the Bible says that through Christ,

599
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,340
 I am more than enough.

600
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,940
 Through Christ, I have everything that I need.

601
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,300
 Through Christ, when I am weak,

602
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
 if I am not enough, he is made strong,

603
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,180
 the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12.

604
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,780
 That his power is made perfect

605
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,560
 in not enough people like me.

606
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,440
 And so if that's where I am,

607
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,900
 a fuller expression of the truth

608
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,780
 is what I need in that midst of the lie.

609
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
 Here's what I know about you,

610
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,740
 the lies that you're tempted to believe,

611
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,420
 the reason they have power or they grab at your heart

612
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,740
 is there's some truth in them.

613
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,380
 And what you need to do is not give some sort of positive,

614
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,660
 like, you know what, you, like here,

615
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,500
 I wrote out some of them.

616
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 Like maybe the lie that you believe is,

617
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,300
 hey, I'll always be single and alone on Valentine's Day.

618
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,600
 Maybe that's the lie you believe.

619
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,100
 And the reason it's powerful is because there's some truth.

620
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,140
 You may always be single

621
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,900
 and not in a relationship on Valentine's Day.

622
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,140
 That's the truth.

623
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,020
 But it's not all the truth.

624
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,500
 The further truth is that God says,

625
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,180
 "Through Christ, you have everything that you need.

626
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,340
 "He will supply all of your needs.

627
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,660
 "He will never leave you nor forsake you.

628
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,440
 "If you have Jesus, you have never been alone

629
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,380
 "and you never will be alone.

630
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,960
 "And you have the thing that will satisfy you

631
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,500
 "like no man ever will or no woman ever will."

632
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,300
 And so it's not just, what I'm saying is,

633
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,280
 when it comes to like, hey, I need to combat the lies

634
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,380
 that I believe with the truth,

635
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,220
 I'm not just saying, hey,

636
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,900
 you need to just pick a Bible verse

637
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,060
 and then hold onto that in those times of trouble.

638
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,300
 You need to tell yourself the truth.

639
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,780
 I may have cancer.

640
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,560
 I may.

641
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,140
 But God has promised that he is in control.

642
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,340
 He's working for my good.

643
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,160
 He loves me.

644
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,520
 He has plans to prosper me, not to harm me.

645
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,540
 Anything that he allows to come through his hands

646
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,780
 are for my good and for his purposes.

647
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,680
 And I can trust him.

648
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,460
 Or I can just worry about it and be anxious

649
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,320
 and fill my mind with toxic thoughts.

650
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,360
 And you need to tell yourself the truth.

651
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,200
 What are some other ones?

652
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,300
 I can't change.

653
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,140
 You can't change.

654
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,980
 That's true.

655
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,580
 But over and over, the Bible teaches

656
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,300
 that Christ can change you and he will

657
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,980
 if you surrender and walk with him.

658
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
 Another truth.

659
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,040
 Man, what if my boyfriend cheats on me?

660
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,100
 I could come up here and I could just say,

661
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,740
 it would be awesome to be a pastor and be like,

662
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,220
 dude, here's the promise of God.

663
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,420
 He'll never cheat on you.

664
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,700
 He'll never abandon you.

665
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,140
 It'll be enough every time.

666
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,240
 That's not true.

667
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,340
 He may cheat on you.

668
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,380
 First, you shouldn't date guys who may cheat on you.

669
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,220
 And the second is, man, don't ever put your hope

670
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,300
 in a man or in a woman other than Christ.

671
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,980
 And so you've gotta embrace whatever,

672
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,500
 I don't know about the lies that you're tempted to believe.

673
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,780
 I don't know what the strongholds

674
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,600
 that you gotta have truth in order to demolish them are.

675
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,140
 But you need to know the truth.

676
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,900
 And it is in confronting those things

677
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,380
 you'll experience a freedom.

678
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,020
 Maybe the lie is, hey, my friends don't care about me.

679
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,580
 And again, I could just stand up here and be like,

680
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,900
 of course they care about you.

681
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,500
 Every person with the spirit of God cares about you.

682
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,400
 They may not care about you.

683
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,460
 But you can either say, man, they may not.

684
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
 But you know what?

685
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,500
 I'm here to serve, not to be served,

686
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,400
 and I'm gonna care about them.

687
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,940
 That's what I'm on this planet to do, care for people.

688
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,620
 And so the choice is yours,

689
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,860
 and you gotta confront it with the truth from God's word

690
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,440
 and align that with just reality around us.

691
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,260
 But finally, my value is in how I look,

692
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,280
 where I work, and what I earn.

693
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,500
 A lot of us can struggle with that.

694
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,340
 I know I can.

695
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,500
 And here's the truth.

696
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,620
 Your value is in where you work,

697
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,500
 how much you earn, and how you look to the world.

698
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,860
 Let me say it another way.

699
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,500
 To people whose opinions don't matter.

700
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,320
 To people whose opinions won't last.

701
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,640
 But your worth, in the truest sense,

702
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,680
 has already been defined by God of the universe,

703
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,580
 saying I find you so valuable,

704
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,520
 I will give my own life for you.

705
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,720
 That's how much you are worth.

706
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
 And it has nothing to do with how you look,

707
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,360
 how much you earn, and where you work.

708
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,580
 But the truth is not to say, like,

709
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,720
 no, that stuff doesn't matter.

710
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,520
 It matters a lot to worldly people who don't know Jesus.

711
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,200
 And every day, you're gonna be bombarded with people

712
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,560
 who are like, this is what matters in life,

713
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
 and you've got to hold onto the truth.

714
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
 It matters to them.

715
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,920
 Am I gonna let it matter to me?

716
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,240
 Am I gonna let it define who I am?

717
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,040
 Or am I gonna let Jesus, and what he did on the cross,

718
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,020
 define who I am?

719
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,000
 And that's a choice you have to make.

720
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,680
 But all of us can experience winning the battle of the mind

721
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,960
 if you remove toxic thoughts,

722
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
 and if you replace the lies with the truth.

723
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,080
 When I was on the subway,

724
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,720
 here's what, like, is encouraging to me,

725
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,760
 is the more that you embrace God's truth

726
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,960
 in the midst of the lie,

727
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,560
 the easier it becomes for your mind to run to the truth.

728
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,680
 In those moments where I'm tempted

729
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,320
 to get on the train of anxiety,

730
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,000
 it becomes easier to, God is with me, he's for me,

731
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,360
 I can trust him, he's in control, I've never had control.

732
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,400
 That's an illusion and a myth.

733
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,340
 God loves me, I can have peace.

734
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,120
 Because everything is sifting through his hands,

735
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,360
 and he is for me.

736
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,800
 The more that I rehearse and ingrain that in my mind

737
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,520
 and believe that, the easier it becomes

738
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
 when I'm tempted, in order to get on that anxiety train,

739
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,880
 to run to the train of truth.

740
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,600
 And the more that you continue to renew your mind,

741
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,040
 combat the lies with the truth, the easier it becomes.

742
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,240
 It's not dissimilar to this.

743
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
 When I was running around on the subway,

744
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,000
 or when I was riding around on the subway,

745
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
 there are times where I was like,

746
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,840
 oh no, I'm on the wrong train here.

747
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,960
 You know what didn't happen a lot?

748
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,000
 I was with a friend who lives up in that city.

749
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,560
 He never got on the wrong train.

750
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,800
 He lives there every single day.

751
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,720
 If he got on it, he knew immediately,

752
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
 oh man, I'm on the wrong train.

753
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,560
 I gotta get back on the A train.

754
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,960
 And he would quickly get off,

755
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,220
 'cause he had familiarized himself with it.

756
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,680
 This is how science, neuroscience,

757
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,920
 which is the study of the brain,

758
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,360
 says your brain actually works.

759
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,000
 It's just aligning with God's word.

760
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,120
 In Romans chapter 12, it said,

761
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,240
 "When you renew your mind,

762
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,040
 "it changes the way that you think."

763
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,620
 You create neural pathways, if you will,

764
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,560
 that make it easier to run to that truth every single time,

765
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,600
 the more that you do it.

766
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,460
 And it weakens the power of the lie,

767
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,360
 makes it less likely to run to that.

768
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,280
 Science is saying, this is how your mind works.

769
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,760
 And the more that you renew your mind

770
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,420
 around the truth from God's word and reject the lie,

771
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,480
 it gets only easier and easier.

772
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
 In the same way, it's also true

773
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,640
 that there are gonna be times where,

774
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,480
 because either you don't know God's word enough,

775
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,600
 so you need to read God's word

776
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,040
 if you're gonna combat the lie with the truth.

777
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,880
 There's gonna be other times

778
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,120
 where you're just at a place where you're like,

779
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,340
 man, I'm stuck.

780
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
 I don't know how to get off this train.

781
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,080
 I don't wanna be on this train.

782
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,400
 It's a depression train,

783
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,040
 and I don't know how to get off of here.

784
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
 And so I don't know what else to do.

785
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,360
 And what do you do?

786
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,080
 Very similar to in that situation.

787
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,800
 In New York, my wife and I

788
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,240
 headed to the Christmas tree lighting.

789
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
 Here's what's true about subways.

790
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,920
 This is like a subway message, train message.

791
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,460
 They're never like perfect.

792
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,160
 There's always construction going on,

793
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,960
 on the Green Line one,

794
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
 and there's always just something off.

795
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,400
 And then they operate between hours of like,

796
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,000
 between 1 p.m. and 2 a.m., no train going here.

797
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,100
 So there's just times you're like,

798
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
 I literally don't know what to do.

799
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,440
 I'm looking at it,

800
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,560
 and the option that we had is not working now,

801
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,400
 so what do we do?

802
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,320
 What did I do?

803
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
 I asked those around me.

804
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,840
 I brought others in, said, I don't know, I'm stuck.

805
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,920
 I don't wanna be on this train.

806
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,200
 I don't wanna go to this destination.

807
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,480
 I wanna go to that destination.

808
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,360
 Will you help me?

809
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,960
 This is what you have got to do

810
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,240
 if you're gonna win the battle of your mind,

811
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,880
 because you will not always be able to know,

812
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,520
 I can't get on the right train.

813
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
 I want to fight this lie,

814
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
 I just don't know how to right now.

815
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,160
 And you gotta bring others in along the journey

816
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
 as we help one another.

817
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,160
 That's how God created and wired us to work.

818
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,480
 Finally, the third idea,

819
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,600
 as it relates to winning the battle in your mind,

820
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,120
 it comes from the same chapter of Philippians,

821
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
 where he says this.

822
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,340
 Rejoice or have joy,

823
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,140
 be joyful in the Lord always.

824
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,260
 I will say it again, be joyful or rejoice.

825
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,600
 I read this and I'm like,

826
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,160
 are you saying that joy is a choice, Paul?

827
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,280
 Like I can just choose to be joy?

828
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
 Are you writing this from Cancun or something

829
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,240
 with a Mai Tai in your hand?

830
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
 No, he's writing it with a armed man

831
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,640
 chained to him from a prison cell.

832
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
 How can you write that, Paul?

833
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,160
 Because he doesn't say, hey, rejoice in all,

834
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,440
 or in the circumstances,

835
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,740
 it says in the Lord, in every circumstance.

836
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,360
 But the apostle Paul would say,

837
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,200
 hey, you have to choose joy.

838
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,440
 The third thing, if you wanna win the battle in your mind,

839
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,520
 is you have to reframe with the right perspective.

840
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,760
 What do I mean by that?

841
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,800
 I mean with an eternal perspective.

842
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
 You can either choose to see the lens

843
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
 and kind of the world around you

844
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,480
 with an earthly perspective and with today,

845
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
 and this is always how it's gonna be,

846
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,200
 or with an eternal perspective.

847
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,760
 The apostle Paul was able to choose joy

848
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,960
 because he maintained an eternal perspective.

849
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,320
 He said, look, no matter what the situation is,

850
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,360
 because of the truths that I know,

851
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,500
 because of the fact that I'm gonna spend

852
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,880
 forever and ever and ever with God,

853
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,560
 that there's gonna come a day five billion years from now,

854
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,640
 I look back and the fact that I was chained to this,

855
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,740
 that Rocky over here was not that big of a deal,

856
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,440
 I can always choose joy no matter what

857
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,040
 because I know where my hope is.

858
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,480
 And he would say, so can you.

859
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,120
 Whatever situation you're in,

860
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,120
 you have an opportunity to reframe it

861
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,520
 with the right perspective around you.

862
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,820
 Let me further illustrate what I mean by that.

863
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,260
 To choose to see the goodness of God

864
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,320
 and the best in the scenario around you.

865
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,240
 And before you run off,

866
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,200
 let me explain a little bit more what I mean.

867
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,040
 The apostle Paul, three chapters earlier,

868
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,280
 explained exactly what this looks like.

869
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,720
 Where in the very first chapter of the book, he says this.

870
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,760
 Now I want you to know brothers,

871
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,960
 this is Philippians 1, verse 12 and 13,

872
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,840
 that what has happened to me

873
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,280
 has actually served to advance the gospel.

874
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,400
 And as a result, it has become clear

875
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,420
 throughout the entire palace guard

876
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,960
 and to everyone that I am in chains for Christ.

877
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
 And because of my chains,

878
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,140
 most of the brothers and sisters

879
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,560
 have become confident in the Lord

880
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,000
 and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.

881
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Paul says, hey, most people, I'm sitting here,

882
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,240
 I'm locked up next to Rocky and I'm sitting here,

883
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,840
 I'm in chains, I'm thrown away.

884
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,780
 And most people be like, hey, where's God now?

885
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,840
 What are you doing?

886
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,000
 I'm so angry, this is terrible, I'm just upset.

887
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,460
 And he says, this is amazing.

888
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,000
 I have a chance where every eight hours,

889
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,760
 I'll get a new guy, they would change up the guard

890
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,820
 every eight hours and they come in

891
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,680
 and I have a captive audience literally,

892
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,780
 and I tell them about Jesus.

893
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,360
 And now the entire imperial guard knows about Jesus,

894
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,120
 what he just said.

895
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,240
 That even in the midst of a circumstance,

896
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,600
 everyone would be like, dude, that is bad,

897
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,440
 we need to pray for him.

898
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,640
 He's like, this is great.

899
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
 I get one guy after the next, after the next,

900
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,400
 and they're all coming to know

901
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,300
 at least the Jesus that I talk about.

902
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,840
 He was able to see and reframe it with the right perspective

903
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,160
 that even some of the worst moments

904
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,120
 or most mundane, trivial moments, frustrating moments

905
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,700
 that I can choose and I must choose

906
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,120
 to look for the goodness of God around me.

907
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,360
 It's not dissimilar to this, in case you're not following me.

908
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,480
 It's like, it's a little bit of what we do

909
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,840
 when we choose the right filter on Instagram.

910
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
 You guys know what I mean by that?

911
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
 Here's what I mean.

912
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,080
 Is whenever I take a picture,

913
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,260
 you guys know what the most popular filter is on Instagram?

914
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,060
 Anyone know?

915
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,140
 Claritin, whatever that is.

916
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,560
 Claritin is the most popular.

917
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,020
 And here's really, I think,

918
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,500
 the filter that you choose in the room, let's be honest.

919
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,420
 How do you choose the filter that you use?

920
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,780
 Whichever one you look best in.

921
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,460
 That's where you're like, no, not as good.

922
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,740
 I'm like, I haven't seen the sun in a year in that one.

923
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,300
 Okay, move to that one, that one, that one.

924
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,620
 And you choose a filter based on

925
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,700
 whichever one makes it look the best, right?

926
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,120
 Like, here we go, we'll just, look good, here we go.

927
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
 And there you are.

928
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
 Then I would go, and I'm gonna take this,

929
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,240
 and I'm gonna be like, man, not that one, not that one.

930
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,040
 Oh, oh, that's not good.

931
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,360
 And I would choose the right filter

932
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,840
 based on whichever one looks best,

933
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
 or is the best looking.

934
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,320
 In the same way, the Apostle Paul would say,

935
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,200
 hey, you do not have a choice over everything

936
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,120
 that you're gonna face in life,

937
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,320
 but you have a choice over the filter

938
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,760
 that you're gonna place on it.

939
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
 And you can choose the best looking one

940
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,200
 and seek to see the goodness of God

941
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
 no matter what's going on around you.

942
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,360
 Or you can choose to see the filter

943
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,080
 just like the world's evil, but you can choose joy.

944
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
 What does this look like?

945
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,600
 I gave some practical, let me give you some practical

946
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,960
 examples of what I mean by that.

947
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
 Maybe you found, like, hey, my car is in the shop.

948
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,360
 That's a down, that's a bummer of a day.

949
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,220
 My car, it may be totaled, I don't know what's going on.

950
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,720
 My engine's having trouble.

951
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,640
 I can choose to be angry, or I can choose to say,

952
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,040
 man, God, thank you that I even have a car.

953
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,120
 Like, 2% of the world has a car.

954
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,220
 Thank you that I have a car that can even go to the shop.

955
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,640
 Maybe your dishwasher, you came home tonight,

956
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,600
 your dishwasher's broke.

957
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
 You can either choose to be like, man,

958
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,680
 what in the world, God, I thought it was following you

959
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,080
 at the porch tonight, or you can choose to say,

960
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,600
 all right, God, my dishwasher's broken.

961
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,100
 I guess I'll have more time to listen to a porch sermon

962
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,720
 as I wash these dishes by hand.

963
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
 (congregation laughing)

964
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,560
 I mean, think about it.

965
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,120
 Maybe you're sick, and my response is like,

966
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
 oh, man, I can't believe I'm sick.

967
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,540
 Or I could say, I'm sick, God, thank you for sickness

968
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,680
 'cause it reminds me to be thankful

969
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,040
 for all the days where I'm not and I'm healthy.

970
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,480
 Or, hey, you're at the office,

971
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,720
 and they had this big party and cake.

972
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,600
 They brought cake in, and everyone ate the cake

973
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,440
 before you got there.

974
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,260
 You can either choose to be like,

975
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,280
 man, these people, unbelievable,

976
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,880
 or you can just say, it's probably good.

977
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,440
 I didn't need that cake, okay?

978
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,280
 (congregation laughing)

979
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,500
 I don't need more cake in my life, and I'm thankful.

980
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,400
 Whatever situation, you will not choose

981
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,160
 the things that you face in life, and those are trivial,

982
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,880
 but you can choose how you frame it

983
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,320
 and the filter you put on it.

984
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,400
 Just like with the Instagram, we look for the best looking.

985
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,960
 Because of God, his promises,

986
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,540
 our eternal security that we have,

987
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,820
 no matter what we face in this life,

988
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,760
 he's working for our good.

989
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,520
 You can choose to look for the goodness of God

990
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,940
 in every situation.

991
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,760
 Inside of the room, I know that some of the things

992
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,280
 that I just described, they pale in comparison

993
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,520
 to things that you're walking through,

994
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 circumstances that you're facing right now.

995
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,160
 And so me talking about a dishwasher being broken,

996
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,880
 like my mom's got brain cancer.

997
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,040
 I don't have a job.

998
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,800
 My fiance and me just broke up.

999
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,160
 My whole world just changed.

1000
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,440
 You tell me, like, put the right filter on it?

1001
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,120
 And I don't wanna pretend that I know everything

1002
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,320
 and every emotion that you're feeling

1003
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,080
 and everything that you're walking through.

1004
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,420
 And I'm also not just saying, well, hey, man,

1005
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,040
 just be positive and everything will look up.

1006
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,420
 'Cause I, like you, walk through things

1007
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,400
 and hear through stories and experience things

1008
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
 in my own life where I'm like, man,

1009
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,000
 I cannot see exactly what God is doing here.

1010
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,480
 I'm not smart enough to know how you're gonna redeem

1011
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,960
 someone being molested.

1012
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,000
 But I know this, there will come a day

1013
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
 where according to Ecclesiastes chapter three,

1014
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,480
 for even the things in this life

1015
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,920
 where like, that doesn't make sense, God,

1016
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,020
 I don't know what you're doing there.

1017
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,120
 We will see everything made beautiful in its time.

1018
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,360
 That's what the verse says.

1019
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,720
 Ecclesiastes chapter three.

1020
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,120
 And that truth along with the truth in Romans chapter eight

1021
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,640
 that everything, if you are a follower of Jesus

1022
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
 in your life is gonna be made to work for your good.

1023
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,040
 And God is using that inside of your life.

1024
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,440
 It's not dissimilar to this and I'll close here.

1025
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,120
 When I was in school or there was a time

1026
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,560
 after I actually graduated from school,

1027
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,760
 I got invited to go to a football game for my alma mater.

1028
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,480
 And I was given tickets and I got to sit

1029
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,080
 on kind of the front second row and I was down on eye level.

1030
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,840
 And all of a sudden the halftime, the band came out

1031
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,820
 and the band came out.

1032
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,040
 And what happens when the band,

1033
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,520
 they start doing like a choreographed thing.

1034
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,020
 When you're looking at it from the ground level,

1035
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,280
 it looks like chaos.

1036
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,480
 You're like, what is going on right now?

1037
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,760
 Like the tuba is about to take over the xylophone

1038
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,040
 and the clarinets over here.

1039
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,600
 Do they even have clarinets in these things?

1040
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,240
 And it just looks like total chaos from the ground level.

1041
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,600
 And then you look up at the screen and you see,

1042
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,760
 oh, it's spelling something out.

1043
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
 It was all purposeful.

1044
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,120
 It looked chaotic.

1045
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,080
 It looked random.

1046
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,200
 It looked, what?

1047
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,780
 And then up at the screen, when you see it from above,

1048
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,940
 it's totally different.

1049
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,540
 I know that some people in this room

1050
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,180
 are holding onto something that I have no idea

1051
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,220
 how God, when we see it from above,

1052
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,240
 is gonna make us all go, wow, it's totally different.

1053
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,660
 He allowed it, he didn't cause it.

1054
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,500
 There was a purpose even in the pain.

1055
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,760
 I further know that because we saw it

1056
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,300
 ultimately on the cross.

1057
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,880
 The son of God becomes a man, comes to earth,

1058
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,740
 lives a perfect life, goes around,

1059
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,360
 never sins, never does anything wrong.

1060
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,520
 What does he do his entire life?

1061
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,480
 Spends it pouring himself out for humanity.

1062
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
 He allows blind people to see.

1063
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
 He allows lame people to walk.

1064
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,120
 He heals people.

1065
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,760
 He restores families, transforms the area in which he lived.

1066
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,440
 And one day he's betrayed by all of his friends

1067
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,480
 or abandoned by all of them, betrayed by one of them.

1068
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,220
 He's taken before a crowd, he's wrongfully accused,

1069
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,160
 and the crowd cries out, "Crucify this man."

1070
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,700
 That's a bad day.

1071
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,400
 And he's led away, he's crucified on a hill called Calvary,

1072
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,260
 and he dies a brutal death

1073
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,820
 at the hands of men he created

1074
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,420
 and formed in their mother womb.

1075
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,100
 Being held up by a cross made of wood

1076
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,720
 that he fashioned the tree and created and gave life to it.

1077
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,540
 It's a bad day,

1078
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,080
 depending on how you frame it.

1079
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,580
 Because it's also the greatest day,

1080
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,540
 the greatest evil act in human history.

1081
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,660
 Humanity, the creation, killing their creator

1082
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,260
 would also become the greatest act in all of human history,

1083
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,580
 the greatest day in human history,

1084
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,700
 because it's not just the day that Jesus died,

1085
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,860
 it's the day that death died

1086
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,360
 and where God entered into the world and said,

1087
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,700
 "I will provide a way.

1088
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,660
 "I will give a sacrifice of myself

1089
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,340
 "so that anyone who trusts in me,

1090
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,540
 "not in themself, can have eternal life."

1091
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,220
 It's all how you frame it.

1092
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,500
 And some of you inside of this room,

1093
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,020
 what you need to know more than anything else,

1094
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,380
 all the truths we talked about, about winning your mind,

1095
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,260
 about recognizing the thoughts you have,

1096
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,380
 removing the toxic ones,

1097
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,500
 about replacing the lie with the truth,

1098
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,820
 about reframing it in light of God's eternal perspective.

1099
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,420
 The truth that you need to know more than anything else

1100
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,300
 is not that you need to get off the train of anxiety.

1101
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,220
 You were born into this world as a child of wrath,

1102
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,060
 the Bible says.

1103
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,220
 You were on a train from the moment

1104
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,460
 you breathed your first breath

1105
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,020
 to the sins that put you into who you are today,

1106
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,060
 the sins that you've created,

1107
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,240
 placed you on a train, not to anxiety, but to hell.

1108
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,900
 And there was only one remedy to get off that train,

1109
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,380
 and that is to put yourself underneath the trust

1110
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,340
 or put your trust in the Savior who died in your place,

1111
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,420
 who came to defeat death,

1112
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,940
 to offer eternal life to you and to me

1113
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,980
 and anyone who will accept it.

1114
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,460
 Do you have, according to the Bible,

1115
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,740
 have your mind, your mind has been blinded.

1116
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,580
 That's what it says.

1117
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,540
 2 Corinthians chapter four says,

1118
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,780
 the mind of unbelievers,

1119
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,820
 if you're not a believer in Jesus,

1120
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,540
 your mind has been blinded, the Bible says.

1121
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,560
 And it's blinded you from being able to see

1122
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,380
 the goodness of God and the glory of God in Jesus

1123
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,940
 and the work that he did on the cross.

1124
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,020
 And today that God is inviting you.

1125
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,260
 I wanna have a relationship with you.

1126
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,740
 I went to such great lengths to die for you.

1127
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,820
 Will you accept the hands that are reaching out to you,

1128
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,300
 the hands that reached a part for you,

1129
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,660
 will you accept that offer?

1130
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,820
 And if you do, you will have eternal life.

1131
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,040
 And if you don't, you will stay on that train.

1132
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,940
 And he offers it to you.

1133
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,260
 And here's the truth, man.

1134
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,340
 You will never now be able to stand before God someday.

1135
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,900
 If you're like, man, I don't know if I believe that,

1136
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,380
 I'm not really sure, I don't know what I believe.

1137
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,220
 I know this at least,

1138
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,340
 you will never again be able to stand before God

1139
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,740
 and say, man, I never heard about Jesus.

1140
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,380
 I never knew he was the only way.

1141
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,060
 Because God will say, man, on February 12th, 2019,

1142
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,780
 you heard about the savior of the world,

1143
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,660
 who came for you.

1144
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,440
 Will you accept him?

1145
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,900
 For the rest of us, the voice is ours.

1146
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,380
 Will we win the battle in our mind

1147
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,600
 by removing toxic thoughts,

1148
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,020
 replacing the lies with the truth,

1149
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,180
 and reframing it in light of the goodness of God

1150
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,060
 with an eternal perspective?

1151
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,900
 Let me pray.

1152
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:48,460
 Father, I wanna pray for two groups of people.

1153
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,860
 And the first is those who I know inside of the room

1154
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,700
 don't know you.

1155
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,980
 And they have never had a moment where they have,

1156
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,000
 through faith, trusted in Christ.

1157
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,140
 I pray that right now, wherever they're seated,

1158
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,260
 they would maybe for the first time just say,

1159
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,540
 Lord, I believe that I'm a sinner.

1160
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,060
 You died for my sin.

1161
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,520
 I trust not in how good I am, but in you.

1162
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,540
 Dying in my place and rising from the grave, that alone.

1163
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,860
 And I pray that that truth, which is,

1164
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,260
 there's no magic prayer, magic words,

1165
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:26,220
 but words that reflect a heart that trusts,

1166
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,680
 a mind that trusts,

1167
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,020
 form the beginning of a relationship.

1168
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,080
 And I pray that all over this room,

1169
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,420
 that would break out in the second group.

1170
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,620
 I wanna pray for people who are walking

1171
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,380
 through the valley of the shadow of cancer,

1172
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,820
 the shadow of heartache and heartbreak,

1173
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,420
 the valley of betrayal, abandonment, pain, God.

1174
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:55,020
 That you would be in this moment

1175
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,940
 and in moments going forward, more real than them,

1176
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,540
 or more real to them than the pain.

1177
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,900
 That you would eclipse those things in their mind.

1178
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,540
 They would recognize toxic thoughts.

1179
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,860
 They would be able to give,

1180
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,720
 or you would give them the grace to reframe

1181
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,700
 no matter what situation they're walking in.

1182
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,460
 And they would hold fast onto you.

1183
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,340
 Would you replace the lies that we all believe

1184
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,840
 with the truth from your word?

1185
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,620
 Thank you for Jesus, we worship you in song, amen.

1186
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,200
 (upbeat music)
