[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]   - For freedom in the history of our nation.
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.620]   - Dallas and Fort Worth.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.320]   - We're advancing the state of the art in every aspect.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.400]   - All right, well, welcome back for week two
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.240]   of revolution or new year revolution.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.860]   I'm gonna start off by opening up a little bit about my life.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.240]   Yes, sir, thank you for being excited mom on the front row.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.040]   It's not my mom.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.800]   When I got married about four and a half years ago,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.980]   I moved in with my wife, Callie.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.480]   It was exciting times.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   I was immediately exposed to some things I was not aware of
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.020]   as it related to what it looked like to live with a woman.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.180]   And they were numerous,
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.160]   but the ones that are relevant to tonight
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.760]   was specifically around wardrobe or clothing.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.820]   One of the first things that I realized
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.160]   was the vast volume of clothes
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.760]   that women bring into their life
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.940]   and that they're gonna carry with them for like forever.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.300]   There's clothes and shirts that I still to this day
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.800]   have never seen anywhere
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.440]   other than just hanging in the closet.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.600]   And I have never, we've been in three different homes.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.340]   I've never actually made it to where my clothes
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.320]   are in the closet inside of our bedroom.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.440]   I have all my clothes in like the hallway closet
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   with a vacuum over there.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.020]   And she's like every square inch I need.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.860]   And the second thing was not just the volume,
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.860]   but was more the accessories that women wear.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.360]   And this was interesting to me
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.140]   because women will wear these accessories that are not,
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.640]   they're, I don't know how else to say this,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.080]   they're pointless.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.700]   They don't actually provide any value
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280]   or any functional value.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.740]   They just kind of, they're to look pretty
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.780]   and they're just kind of like, oh, this is fun.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.080]   Here's what I mean.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.380]   Like my wife has these things called summer scarves.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.680]   Have you heard of this?
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.520]   It's a scarf you wear in the summer.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.820]   What's a scarf for?
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.020]   It's for keeping your neck warm in the winter
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.460]   when it's snowing outside.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.760]   But why do we, I think this is a Texas thing
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.100]   and anthropology thing, but we wear summer scarves
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.460]   so that we don't feel like we're missing out,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.700]   I guess, on what's up north.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.940]   Another thing was like she would,
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.700]   when we would go to nice events,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.480]   she brings something called a clutch.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.540]   I've never heard of this before.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.800]   I didn't know what this was.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.980]   I actually thought it was a grab
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.980]   and called it a grab for a while.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.240]   I was like, where's your grab?
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   She's like, what are you talking about?
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   [congregation laughing]
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.380]   A clutch, for those of you men
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.340]   who are in the room who don't know what,
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.360]   this is a smaller version of the purse
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.780]   that you bring with you whenever you're going
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020]   to a formal activity, a formal event
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.960]   that you're attending together.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.820]   Is there anything in the clutch?
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.320]   No, you just put your phone in there,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.800]   but you bring it as an accessory.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.300]   It's like, what, this makes no sense at all.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.500]   She has these belts that she wears
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.000]   on the outside of her clothing
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400]   that are holding nothing up,
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.100]   which is the purpose of a belt.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.900]   They just kind of like are around a dress.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.440]   It's like, that's like wearing suspenders
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.780]   that are not attached to anything.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.880]   You know that, right?
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.780]   [congregation laughing]
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.440]   Sleeveless turtlenecks,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.620]   where it's like, I'm confused right now.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.580]   Are we hot?
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.660]   Are we cold?
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.380]   You can't, this can't actually be functionally helping you
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.960]   because if you're wearing it because you're hot,
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.460]   you know that your neck is covered up.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.160]   If you're wearing it because you're cold,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.700]   you know that you have nothing on your,
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.300]   there's just these items of clothing,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.000]   accessories predominantly, where I was like,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   man, what is that?
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.560]   What's a bangle?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.400]   What is a bangle?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.500]   Bangles, bracelets, these different things
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.040]   that I was exposed to that were accessories,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.080]   definitely not a necessity,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.740]   and they really didn't add any functional value
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.580]   if you were to take them away.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.520]   Now, here's where I start there,
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.780]   because I think for a lot of us,
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.820]   as it relates to that idea of like,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.040]   man, they're accessories,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.580]   they're definitely not a necessity.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.280]   That's how the Christian faith is.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.860]   That in our life, or in your life,
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.360]   or in the lives of many people,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.460]   that they see Christianity,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.560]   they see their Christian faith,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.420]   they see Christ as kind of an accessory.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.320]   It's a component that I add to my life.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.600]   It's part of who I am.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.640]   You know, I'm a white guy who's X number of years old.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm a girl who's African American.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.940]   I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.440]   I'm from Dallas or I'm from, you know,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.780]   South Carolina or wherever I am,
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.880]   and I'm a Cowboys fan.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.420]   I've got all these kind of different components.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.340]   I'm an accountant, I'm a teacher,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.320]   and one of those components,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.580]   or one of those accessories
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.480]   that's kind of a part of it,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.260]   that's fun to have is Christianity, or Christ.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.280]   And what I wanna talk about tonight
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.860]   is as we continue this series of revolution
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.520]   is what the Apostle Paul's gonna say,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.800]   as it relates to you and I,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.460]   that Christianity is no accessory.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.960]   It is a necessity.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.240]   If you were going to experience
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.840]   the abundant life that God has wired,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   designed, created you to experience,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.540]   that Christ is not some component to add to life,
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.300]   but without him, you will not experience
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.440]   the life that you want.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.000]   Some of you, because of not listening
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.680]   to the Apostle Paul's words tonight,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.280]   your marriage will not last.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.920]   Some of you are going to fall into addiction
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.260]   because of not listening to the Apostle Paul's words tonight
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.760]   as he talks about the importance of Christianity,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   that it is not an accessory that you add,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.920]   it's not just some component of life,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.060]   it is where life itself is found.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.020]   And it is knowing that,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.720]   and understanding how we walk in that,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   that the Apostle Paul says
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.100]   is gonna be the dividing line to determine the life,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.600]   and really what your life is going to produce
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.260]   in terms of the pain, the death, the destruction,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.540]   all that you're gonna bring into it,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.640]   or the life, joy, peace, all of those things.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.800]   So we're gonna be in the book of Galatians chapter five,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.760]   we'll pick it up in verse 19.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Galatians.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.660]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Roman, Corinthians,
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.080]   Galatians, so if you hit Matthew,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.520]   flip the Bible open halfway.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.760]   The easiest way to get to any book of the Bible
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.020]   is this thing called a table of contents, all right?
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.120]   That's our little secret, don't tell anybody else.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.640]   But that's in the front of the Bible.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.820]   And if you turn there, it'll tell you where Galatians is.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.800]   But we'll be in chapter five.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.260]   If you don't have a Bible, we'll have it up on the screens.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.040]   And we also have Bibles in the Welcome Center
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.980]   as a free gift to you.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.880]   So if you don't have one, feel free to go out there
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.360]   and just say, "Hey, I wanted to take you guys
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.480]   "up on the free Bible that you guys have here."
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.040]   So we're gonna be in Galatians chapter five.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.240]   We'll start in verse 16, really 19,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.200]   but I'm gonna read 16 'cause it'll set us up
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.280]   kind of for where we're going.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.760]   The Apostle Paul is right into the church of Galatia.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.000]   Paul, artist or apostle formerly known as Saul,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.020]   went and spent his life for the first half
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.360]   trying to kill Christianity, trying to stomp out Christians,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.200]   meets Jesus, his life is radically changed,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.920]   and all of a sudden he becomes one of the best missionaries
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.160]   the world has ever seen, or the best missionary.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.960]   And he writes all these different letters
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.240]   to these churches in these different areas or cities
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   in the ancient world.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.680]   And so many of those are what's in the Bible,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.280]   is those different letters that Paul wrote.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.800]   This one he wrote to the churches in Galatia,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.400]   and he wrote regarding how they're to now
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   live out their Christian life.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.700]   And in it he gives them an insight into what's at stake
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.720]   if they don't properly understand the life
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   and the access to life that they have in Christ.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.360]   Before we start, let me just say this.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.660]   What he's about to dive into is related to the sin nature.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.520]   And in order to give you a better understanding
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.840]   is what we're about to read, what the Bible says,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.360]   and what experience testifies as you look around the world.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.620]   Is there all is not as it seems
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.740]   because sin entered the world, death entered the world.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.320]   When sin entered, disease came with it,
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.600]   and everything was broken and everything was fractured.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.280]   In other words, when Adam and Eve
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.720]   are the beginnings of the human race,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.680]   disobeyed God, sin entered the world,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.360]   and everything was fractured.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.520]   Human nature was fractured.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   The animal kingdom was fractured.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.360]   Your DNA, your ability to fight off disease was fractured.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.880]   And human nature was fractured.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.180]   And that all of us have this broken sin nature
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.840]   that he's about to tell us what takes place
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.880]   as it relates to that sin nature.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.120]   So verse 16 says this.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.580]   So I, Paul says, live by the Spirit,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.600]   and you will not gratify the desires,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.320]   or you won't fulfill the desires of the sinful nature.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.160]   So Paul's saying, hey, if you wanna avoid
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   living by the sin nature, you've gotta live by the Spirit.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.320]   In order to avoid that self-destructive thing inside of you,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.680]   you gotta live by the Spirit.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.760]   What's so bad about the sinful nature, Paul,
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.640]   which is human nature?
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.560]   You could insert human nature.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.060]   He begins to tell us, here's what it is.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.220]   Now the acts of the sinful nature, verse 19, are obvious.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.920]   In other words, everyone, if you look around,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.800]   it's easy to see people are messed up,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.700]   left to themselves, without law,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.160]   they're gonna just gravitate towards evil.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.180]   Here's some of 'em.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.680]   Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.640]   idolatry, or worshiping anything other than God.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.800]   Witchcraft, which is manipulating the supernatural
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.400]   for selfish reasons.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.960]   Hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.660]   selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.760]   Drunkenness and orgies, or living for the weekend.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.660]   These and the like, which is a Greek word
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.780]   for just et cetera, et cetera.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.780]   I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.420]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.020]   Paul just laid out the symptoms of the sinful nature.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.240]   If you take notes, you can write down
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.000]   the symptoms of the sinful nature.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.500]   Why is the message of Christianity,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.280]   why specifically is Christianity being a necessity
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.120]   so important?
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.820]   Well, the first idea that Paul gives us in this text
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.300]   and the Bible teaches is that you and I on our own
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.540]   without the presence of Christ or the spirit of God
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.060]   in our life left to ourselves, naturally, we're sinful.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.540]   Like in other words, in neutral,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.220]   all of us gravitate towards sin.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.020]   It's so huge 'cause it's such this big idea
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.060]   that's being taught in the world
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.260]   and that maybe you're like, yeah, I kind of agree with that.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.940]   You don't agree with that if you would say,
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.440]   yeah, I think everybody's pretty much a good person.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.940]   You know, I was told that growing up
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.220]   and I think everyone inherently is a good person.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.920]   That is not a biblical idea.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.020]   That doesn't even make sense
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.860]   when you look outside of America.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.580]   In America, we can kind of get away with that
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.860]   'cause we're like, yeah, you know, everything.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.500]   We live in the Disney world of the world.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.740]   When you look outside in the world around us,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.940]   it's the wild, wild west.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.480]   It becomes very, very clear
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.740]   that mankind is not good inherently.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.600]   And Paul says, let me tell you why.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.500]   You were born with the sin nature.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.980]   You were born with a nature inside of you
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.160]   that naturally moves in the direction of sin.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.380]   And he lays out some of the things that like,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.820]   really, it makes it clear.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.780]   This is why it's easy.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.060]   No one had to work at sexual morality in here.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.700]   Nobody's like, no, I've been really trying
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.420]   to up my porn game this year.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.460]   No one had to work at that.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.980]   No one had to work at jealousy.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.740]   No one was like, man, I'm just so like,
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.740]   I'm so happy for you how thin you are.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.760]   And look at me, I'm not, but I'm so happy for you.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.660]   Everyone's easily bent towards like,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.700]   oh my gosh, you're so skinny.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.260]   You must be anorexic, I hate you.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   And that comes naturally, Paul says, hatred, racism.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.860]   Paul says, man, you wanna know the biggest problem
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.700]   that mankind has.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.660]   You wanna know the biggest problem that you have,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.540]   the world has, is sin nature.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.920]   I mean, we kind of know this intuitively.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.380]   It's why we have laws, right?
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.340]   Like imagine if there was a day where,
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.800]   just that we're not laws.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.220]   You can watch "The Purge."
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.980]   It gives you a movie of what it's like
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.220]   if there weren't laws on the land.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.100]   The reason that we even have laws is 'cause we know,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.780]   man, without these, if we just,
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.740]   if people could get away with whatever,
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.840]   there's no end to the evil that they would do.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.260]   And so we have laws that kind of restrain
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.380]   and restrict the evil on our land.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.300]   Because for a lot of us, I think the reason why
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.700]   a lot of husbands don't cheat on their wife
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.860]   is 'cause they think they'll get caught.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.060]   And Paul says, you have sin nature.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.820]   You're not a good person for not cheating on your wife.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.600]   You wanna cheat on your wife.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.940]   The reason a lot of people don't commit crime
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.020]   is because they're afraid of getting caught.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.380]   Paul says, look, you have a sin-broken nature.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.040]   These are the symptoms of this broken thing inside of you
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.420]   that you by yourself, in neutral, gravitate towards sin.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.260]   You and I do.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.300]   It's the reason why addictions take place.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.260]   Think about that.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.700]   People self-destruct themselves.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.180]   I mean, I'm not even trying to cast judgment on that.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.520]   I'm saying, think about that.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.500]   Why would people do things that only hurt themselves?
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.100]   And Paul says, look, I can tell you why.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.740]   It's because you and I have a sin nature.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.980]   Human nature is sin nature.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.100]   The Bible teaches all throughout it that, man,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.160]   God looks down, people are not inherently good.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.660]   Psalm 14, two and three says this.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.620]   The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.800]   to see if there are any who understand,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.700]   any who seek God.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.100]   All have turned away.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.500]   All have become corrupt.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.120]   There is no one who does good, not even one.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.140]   If you have ever been around even infants or toddlers
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.860]   or young kids, that's the easiest,
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.060]   clear illustration of seeing this.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:20.900]   We're in this stage right now
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.140]   where all of our friends have toddlers.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.100]   And so everywhere I look, there's little kids
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.920]   around us right now.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.080]   A little toddler and they're all around us
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   kind of all the time.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.740]   Here's what I've never seen
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.480]   from any of these little rugrats running around.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.920]   Never one time, whenever they're together
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.240]   and they're playing with little toys,
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.720]   never has any of them ever said,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   oh my gosh, they have my toy.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.200]   No, yours, it's yours, you take it first.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   But constantly they will say, mine, mine, mine.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.260]   And it's not even their toy.
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.760]   We're not even in our house.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.920]   It's someone else's stuff.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.660]   I'm like, that is not yours, that's not mine.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.340]   Because they are from the womb
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.780]   able to have selfishness come out of them and say, mine.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.100]   They weren't ever taught that.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.700]   We don't go around our house, at my house,
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700]   where I'm like, hey, oh my gosh, my wife, that's my pillow.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.820]   Mine, that is mine, that's my pillow.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820]   You didn't see that from someone.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.120]   It's natural.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.340]   It comes naturally.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.420]   Paul says, so it does with you.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.340]   So it does with me.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.940]   Sin nature, left to ourself.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.480]   What comes is immorality, is sin.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.340]   But he continues, and he really gives us
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.500]   the solution to the problems of the symptoms
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.260]   of this disease of sin.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.740]   Here's what he says.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.260]   But the fruit of the Spirit, that's the Spirit of God.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.940]   The fruit is the same word for produce or offspring.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.700]   What is produced in someone's life
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:47.140]   is love, is joy, is peace, patience, kindness,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.760]   goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.900]   The Apostle Paul says that when the Spirit of God
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.460]   comes into someone's life, that's what happens
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.180]   when you become a Christian, when a person puts their faith
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.740]   in what Christ did on the cross for them.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.140]   Hey, I'm putting my faith that Jesus died in my place
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.220]   on the cross for my sin.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.380]   He paid for it, and he came back alive
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.020]   to show the payment was more than enough, check cleared.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.600]   When a person puts their faith in that,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.100]   all of a sudden the Spirit of God comes into their life
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.060]   and begins to change and form their character.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.340]   And the Apostle Paul says, hey, you know what happens
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   when a person is led or governed by the Spirit of God?
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.860]   Something is produced.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.820]   Love, what's love?
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   Love is, the word here is used almost more like charity,
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.240]   'cause if you look around, you're like,
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.540]   man, a lot of people in our world
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.780]   are really passionate about love.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.260]   This isn't like the flowery, like,
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.500]   hey, everything is love, man, you do you.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.340]   This isn't that love.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.020]   This is a love that's self-sacrificing.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.120]   It's the word agape that says, man, I'm gonna die to myself,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.960]   put you in front of myself.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.700]   He says that's what the Spirit of God
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.300]   brings into someone's life.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.320]   They all of a sudden, they begin to want to love people.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.820]   Kindness is brought into their life.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.660]   Joy is brought into their life.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.180]   Peace, the supernatural peace,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.460]   not like this just kind of temperamental surfer guy
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.140]   who's like, yeah, man, everything's gonna work out.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.980]   It's gonna be good.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.500]   But the supernatural peace comes into someone's life.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.060]   Kindness, self-control.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.300]   The Apostle Paul says, look,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.320]   the remedy or the solution for the sin nature,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.080]   which is our second idea, is the Spirit of God.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.820]   For you and I to experience freedom from that sin nature,
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.860]   freedom from the symptoms of the sin nature
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.060]   that come into our life, Paul says,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.220]   hey, there is a remedy.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.600]   It does not come from within you.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.980]   It comes from the Spirit of God inside of someone's life.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.480]   I mean, how attractive are these qualities?
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.320]   I mean, think about it.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.940]   Like, that is like, if you had a list and you were like,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.360]   man, I'm looking for a spouse.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.100]   This would be the amazing list to have.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.440]   Nobody's like, nobody's going back to that other list
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.740]   of like, you know what I'm looking for?
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.300]   Someone who's a witch.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.820]   I'm looking for a witchcraft.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.660]   Hello.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.420]   No one's looking for like a guy who's like,
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.100]   he's got an anger problem.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.940]   I know a lot of you are like, no, I like, you know,
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.260]   tough, bad Barry.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.440]   You don't like bad Barry when you marry Barry
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.120]   and he keeps punching holes in the wall.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.020]   That's not the guy you wanna marry.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.900]   Like, how attractive is this list of like,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.460]   love, joy, peace, patience, you know,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.060]   and it's kind of, that's what Paul says
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.980]   is what the Spirit wants to bring about
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.020]   in the life of a person.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   He wants to lead them in the direction of life.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.940]   Lead them away from the direction of what's natural.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.580]   He wants to come in and supernaturally bring about
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.620]   these things in your life and in my life.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:32.620]   I mean, if you, if you think about how amazing
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.100]   the world would be if for like,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.900]   imagine a world where everyone was governed
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.740]   by the Spirit of God.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.820]   Just go with me on this.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.780]   Every person on the planet, tomorrow we wake up,
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.620]   all of them underneath the governance
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.500]   of the Spirit of God.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.240]   So they're not robots, they just have this fruit,
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.200]   this lifestyle being produced in them
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.860]   where love, joy, peace, patience, you know,
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.700]   it's kind of all this.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.660]   I mean, think about it.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.160]   We wouldn't have to have laws.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.140]   Like, we could do away with the Constitution,
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.580]   do away with laws, do away with all of this.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.680]   Is that bumping on me?
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.380]   Clearly it is.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.780]   Oh, let's go, dude, okay.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.380]   No more Britney Spears, Mike, I like it.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.620]   I mean, seriously, stay with me.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.460]   Imagine a world where you don't have any of those things.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.460]   The sin nature no longer exists,
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.340]   or everyone's governed by the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.940]   You guys talk amongst yourselves for a second,
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.820]   'cause this thing.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:34.180]   Hey, how about Billy Wand?
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.220]   This guy, he is single, ladies.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.660]   Kidding.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.580]   Imagine a world, like, you wouldn't have to have laws.
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.180]   Think about that.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.300]   Like, you wouldn't have to be worried about,
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.740]   like, oh my gosh, there's greed going on.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.620]   Oh my gosh, someone's gonna murder.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.180]   You could open up all the prisons and just say,
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.120]   hey, everybody out, 'cause we're all gonna be fine.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.980]   Everyone's governed by the Spirit of God.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.060]   Like, you don't have to lock your car.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.660]   You don't have to lock anything anymore,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.360]   because the world around you is governed
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.300]   by the Spirit of God, not the sinful nature.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.220]   Even the reason that we have to lock everything,
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.960]   or there is prisons and all of that,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.700]   it's a testimony to the fact that sin nature is real.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.880]   It's behind this destruction in our own lives,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.720]   the destruction in the world around us,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.280]   and the Apostle Paul says there is a way
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.680]   to experience freedom from it,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.840]   but it does not come from within you.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.600]   It comes from the Spirit of God working inside of your life.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.200]   And once he begins to work inside of life,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.120]   it produces that fruit.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.520]   And here's what I get so passionate about.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.440]   This idea from this text,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.920]   is like this is a not natural, a life governed by love,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   patience, joy, peace towards other people, kindness.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   Those are not natural things.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.520]   The church of Jesus Christ, supernaturally, by the Spirit,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.260]   brings to the world qualities
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.200]   that they will not find anywhere else.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.360]   Like, we live in America, and we think,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.440]   yeah, everyone thinks that kindness is a good idea.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.280]   Newsflash, no, they don't.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.260]   Go to countries where there isn't
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.840]   a Judeo-Christian value set up.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.320]   Women, you don't have rights.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.800]   You can't drive a car in Saudi Arabia.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.000]   They're our biggest oil trading partner.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.900]   Think about that.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.760]   I mean, there's 100 million more men in Asia than women
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.360]   because of selective abortion, because you know why?
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.800]   They don't think like the Spirit of Christ
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.680]   that says, hey, look, every single person matters.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.800]   They think men are more valuable than women.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.380]   So selective abortion has killed 100 million less women.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.260]   The values, the perspective, the love,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.380]   the qualities introduced by the Spirit of God
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.660]   to the church are unique.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.500]   You will not find them anywhere else.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.740]   And Paul says, man, they are a necessity for life
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.900]   if you're gonna experience it.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.800]   They're a necessity for the world
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.400]   if they're gonna experience life
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.740]   because it's only there that you're gonna find it.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.020]   And it's not inside of yourself.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.140]   It's not inside of myself.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.420]   It comes from the Spirit of God at work in someone's life.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.700]   And we're gonna get to how he works in someone's life
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.560]   or how we can experience that in a second,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.380]   but more than anything, I hope to overestimate
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.980]   or the fact that I cannot overestimate the importance
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.620]   of what you as the body of Christ, which is a Christian,
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.100]   which is someone who has the Spirit of God
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.440]   leading them in life, what you bring to the world
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.260]   that does not exist anywhere else.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.180]   I mean, think about the 58 million lives
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.660]   that have been lost in this country since 1973
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.900]   through O.V. Wade, through abortion,
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.820]   which did not take place because of those will not acts
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.360]   that were underneath the governing
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.520]   of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.960]   The Holy Spirit does not say, "Kill this child."
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   Well, you and I, as the Church of Jesus Christ,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.940]   when we say we are bringing what is necessary for life,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.980]   it's the life or death,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.800]   and it's the Church of Jesus Christ all over the world,
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.060]   all over the centuries behind us,
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.320]   that has over and over and over again stood up
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.680]   and said what no one else would say,
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.400]   what you can't say apart from the Spirit of God,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.800]   which is, "Hey, look, hey, I have a dream.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.820]   "Every, or one day, people will be known
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.880]   "not by the color of their skin,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.900]   "but the content of their character.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.960]   "I'm a pastor who has a worldview informed
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.920]   "by the Spirit of Christ that every person,
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.040]   "red, yellow, black, white,
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.420]   "they're all precious in his sight.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.920]   "Men and women, they're all valuable."
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.400]   That's a Christian perspective.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.600]   That is the Spirit of God speaking into someone's life.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.460]   That is not a natural view.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.920]   Nature and natural human thinking is racism.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.800]   Slavery, that's natural.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.040]   It's the Spirit of God that worked
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.600]   when William Wilberforce in Great Britain
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.920]   in the early 1800s said way ahead of the game,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   "We're gonna shut down the slave trade over here
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.820]   "because I'm a follower of Christ.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.360]   "What I'm seeing is that every person,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.680]   "based on what God's Word says,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.120]   "based on what the Spirit of God says,
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   "has value, dignity, and this is not acceptable anymore."
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.560]   Over and over and over again,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   the Spirit of God has drove and impacted legislation.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.320]   People were able to endure incredible suffering
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.460]   because of the way that they said,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.920]   "Hey, I'm gonna stand up for what's right here."
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.200]   And it's not natural.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.560]   Man, if you are a part of the body of Christ,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.200]   I could not, even if I tried,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.760]   overestimate how important you are
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.800]   because you bring the supernatural work of the Spirit
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.600]   to a world that needs it, that will not have it,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.120]   will not find it anywhere else.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.440]   I read an article not long ago that we shared,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.160]   I guess it was a while ago now,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.760]   and in a series a few years ago at the porch,
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.540]   but it was by this atheist who was writing
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.880]   about the importance of Christianity in Africa.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.100]   He's a guy named Matthew Paris,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.400]   and he writes for the London Times,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.700]   which is like the New York Times.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.940]   He's basically a reporter for them,
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.900]   and he had spent time in Africa,
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.920]   and he basically wrote, and he was like,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.900]   "Look, I'm an atheist,
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.680]   "but I can't deny how important Christianity,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.100]   "we need more missionaries over here."
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.980]   And so I just wanna read it
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.580]   just 'cause it's such a powerful,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.460]   what he says from an atheist who looks around and says,
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.260]   "We are not gonna make it without these guys."
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.640]   Here's what he says, in the London Times.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.980]   "As an atheist, I truly believe Africa needs God.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.720]   "This confounds my ideological beliefs,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.920]   "stubbornly refuses to fit my worldview,
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.640]   "and has embarrassed my growing belief
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.480]   "that there is no God.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.860]   "Though I'm an atheist,
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.780]   "I've become convinced of the enormous contribution
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.560]   "Christian evangelism makes in Africa,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.180]   "sharply distinct from the work of secular NGOs
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.500]   "and government projects and international aid efforts.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   "These alone will not do."
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.000]   Come on, dude, this'll preach.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.760]   "Education and training will not do,"
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.460]   says this atheist reporter
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.440]   for one of the largest newspapers in the world.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.940]   "In Africa, Christianity changes people's hearts."
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.260]   The change is good.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.300]   "Christians, black and white,
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.640]   "working in Africa do heal the sick,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.140]   "do teach people to read and write,
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.540]   "and only the severest kind of secularist or atheist
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.220]   "could see a mission hospital or a school
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.580]   "and say the world would be better
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.220]   "without that Christian school or hospital.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.180]   "Missionaries, not aid money,
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.980]   "are the solution to Africa's biggest problem.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.840]   "Removing Christian," hold on,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.340]   "removing Christian evangelism from the planet,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.240]   "from the African equation may leave the continent,"
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.140]   listen to this.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.380]   Dude, this is so crazy, he's an atheist going,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.420]   hey, look, guys, if we get these Christians out of here,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.120]   hold on, don't let 'em leave yet.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.280]   Here's what he says, the final words.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.800]   "Removing Christian evangelism from the African equation
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   "may leave the continent at the mercy
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.460]   "of a malign fusion of Nike, the witch doctor,
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.980]   "the mobile phone, and the machete."
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.920]   Matthew Paris, the London Times,
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.640]   that this atheist looks on and he says,
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.660]   look, let me tell you something,
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.340]   Christianity, there's something super,
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.980]   there's something, I don't even believe in God,
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.420]   but it changes people's hearts.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.000]   It changes the way that they act,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.200]   the way that they think.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.860]   In this place, this continent needs it.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.280]   The thing that he left out of that,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.800]   as amazing as it is, is that this world needs it.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.520]   Matthew needs it, whether he realizes it or not.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.540]   Apart from the Spirit of God,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.700]   we all drift towards self-destruction.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.220]   We all drift towards pride, towards anxiety,
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.540]   towards anger, towards depression.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.140]   That's why substance abuse is out of control,
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.460]   and the Apostle Paul says,
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.180]   that's 'cause you have the sin nature.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.340]   That's where the problem is.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.420]   There is a solution.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.660]   It is the Spirit of God producing
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.160]   and working in someone's life.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.900]   And as you read that, you go, man,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.120]   well, how do I access that?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.540]   How do I experience, if that's a necessary thing for life,
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.180]   not an accessory, how do I have the Spirit of God
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.200]   produce that in my life?
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.700]   Which is where Paul goes next.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.560]   Those, verse 24, those who belong to Christ Jesus
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.940]   have crucified the sinful nature,
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.660]   or they've already said they put it to death.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.940]   Whenever Jesus died on the cross,
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.060]   they were like, hey, I'm leaving the old life behind.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.960]   That's dead.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.700]   Along with his passions and desires.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.760]   Since we live by the Spirit,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.360]   let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.760]   Now, this little word for keep in step,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.220]   it literally is the word for walking dependent on,
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.500]   or step-by-step moving with someone,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.360]   as if it was like a three-legged race,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.060]   or someone walking on your shoes.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.100]   It's a little word for like, hey,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.180]   every move that they make,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.420]   we're gonna keep stepping with it.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.860]   The Apostle Paul just said,
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.960]   the way that you and I live the Christian life
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.100]   is not by trying to follow a bunch of rules,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.720]   not by trying to produce fruit in our own life.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.620]   You really gotta get that.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.720]   It's not you, just hey, go try to be kind.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.900]   You can't go try to be supernaturally kind
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.020]   any more than right now you could grow an orange on your arm.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.980]   You get that, right?
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.400]   Like, it's like, hey, just grow an orange.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.500]   You're like, well, I'm not an orange tree.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.460]   Yeah, you can't grow supernatural because you're natural.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.500]   And he says, the way that you and I
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.020]   access the supernatural in our life,
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.900]   the way that we experience the supernatural fruit
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.700]   growing inside of our life is by dependence,
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   step by step by step dependence on the Spirit of God.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.820]   That we walk with Him every moment,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.700]   every day in ordinary moments,
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.420]   as we face temptation, as we face anxiety,
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.660]   whatever it is, God, I can't, but you can.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.900]   Will you help me right now?
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.080]   I'm tempted right now because my boss, again,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.400]   is doing that thing that all I feel is anger and rage,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.420]   and I hate this place.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.540]   And God, I can't, but you can.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.620]   Will you help me to be faithful and loving?
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.580]   I'm totally dependent on you, God.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.980]   Will you help me right now?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.300]   That in moment by moment, we cry out to Him,
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.140]   call out to Him.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.680]   One of the ways that that looks like is prayer.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.300]   We say, God, will you help me right now?
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.180]   I'm overwhelmed, I'm anxious.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.540]   I know you don't want me to feel anxious.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.160]   That's a sin.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.260]   Will you help me, Lord?
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.380]   I know you love me.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.220]   You're in control.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.280]   Will you help me?
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.760]   Keeping in step with the Spirit
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.700]   also involves other people around you,
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.880]   which is where Paul goes next.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.220]   We don't have time to cover it tonight.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.300]   In Galatians, where he says,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.980]   bear one another's burdens.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.180]   You do this together.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.720]   When you find yourself in that temptation
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.980]   where you're dating that girl,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.980]   and all of a sudden, it's like,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.100]   oh, man, this is, hey, how you doing?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.620]   And you're all of a sudden under the temptation
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.700]   of taking things farther
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.860]   than God's word says you should sexually.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.500]   You say, God, I can't, but you can.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.480]   Will you help me?
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.980]   I'm gonna loop other believers in.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.580]   Hold us accountable to help me, Lord.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.300]   I'm tempted to go back to the bar scene.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   I'm tempted to go back where it is.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.220]   God, I can't, but you can.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.260]   Will you help me now?
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.820]   I'm moment by moment walking in dependence on you.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.740]   That's what Paul says is the Christian life.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.940]   That's how we'll always be lived.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.300]   It's not just like, hey, here's a list.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.920]   Follow these rules.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.580]   It is follow this person.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.720]   Step by step, dependence on God.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.560]   It's like my son.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.700]   My son is 13 months old right now,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.780]   so he's learning to walk,
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.580]   so he's in this phase where he's like,
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   he just leans on stuff when he's trying to walk,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.020]   so it's like Spider-Man up against the wall,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.260]   touching things at all times.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.940]   And he's recently taken ground where he'll like,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.220]   he can walk with us holding his hands.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.060]   Like, he'll take steps,
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.100]   and he'll like put both of his hands in our hands,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.100]   and he'll walk and take steps with them.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.060]   He didn't always love it, but hey,
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.460]   sometimes you gotta play hurt, buddy.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.780]   So we're learning how to walk,
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.820]   and he's walking dependent on his father,
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.880]   dependent on his mother.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.460]   Step by step by step.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.160]   This is how the Christian life is lived.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.420]   Unlike in that scenario where like eventually,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.500]   he's hopefully gonna walk without me like holding his hands
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.340]   where it's like, hey, buddy, we're going to prom.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.640]   Let me hold your hands.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.020]   He's gonna learn, hey, I don't have to be dependent.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.120]   The Christian life from beginning to end
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.020]   is I'm totally dependent on you, God.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.860]   Will you help me?
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.340]   That's how you get saved, right?
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.900]   The way you become a believer is not by going like,
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.820]   hey, God, I've attended church, I'm gonna commute.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.180]   It's like I'm totally dependent on you
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.140]   if I'm gonna get in, God.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.380]   I'm not a good enough person.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.540]   I'm a broken person.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.700]   I need a savior, not a second chance.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.780]   Will you help me?
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.480]   Paul says that is the same way
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.700]   that you live the Christian life.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.900]   The way you get in is the way you finish.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.620]   Moment by moment, dependence.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.920]   You wanna bring about the fruit of the spirit in your life.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.580]   It won't happen by you just trying harder.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.100]   You can try to be kind,
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.000]   and I'm gonna really be patient today,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.700]   but to want to be patient or to want to be kind,
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.360]   it's just overflowing out of you.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.160]   It doesn't come from within you.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.140]   It doesn't come from within me.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.560]   It comes from dependence on the spirit of God,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.040]   and when people throw their hands up and say,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.000]   I surrender, I'm dependent on you,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.160]   I'm gonna keep in step with the spirit,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.400]   which is our third point.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.740]   Their life begins to change.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.360]   Moment by moment, ordinary moments.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.200]   You know what?
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.360]   Even what's going on across this city,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   in El Paso and in Fort Worth and in Tulsa
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.960]   and in Houston and in the woodlands and in spring
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.440]   and really all over the place
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.640]   where people of God are gathered in different churches
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.280]   in different places where people are pursuing Jesus,
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.700]   walking in dependence on him.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.040]   You know what's beginning to take place?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.760]   An everyday, think about this,
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.520]   in everyday ordinary moments,
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.240]   moments that don't even look spectacular,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.840]   people are walking in dependence on God.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.040]   They're dating differently than the world around you.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.520]   They're revolutionary in their dating.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.920]   They're saying, I'm gonna honor how this girl,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.600]   I'm gonna honor the way that I think about her,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.760]   the way that I talk to her,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.640]   the boundaries that I set with her.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.840]   Young adults are walking in dependence
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   as it relates to their job and they're saying,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.940]   I'm not gonna live for the American dream,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.200]   it's too small of a thing to give my life to.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.320]   I'm gonna pursue something bigger,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.120]   which is living for Christ right here, right in this moment,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   and everyday ordinary moments.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   They're revolutionary in their dependence on him.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.480]   And all that that looks like inside of that moment
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.320]   is nothing special.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.400]   I'm anxious, will you help me to trust in you?
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.600]   That's revolutionary.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.880]   While the rest of the world goes, hey, take these meds.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.540]   Take this drink, do something.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:44.400]   And they're revolutionary young adults,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.000]   people of all ages,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.440]   followers of Christ by the Spirit of God,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.920]   producing fruit of them who are saying,
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   I'm gonna walk in dependence on you, God.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.440]   You're gonna define the way that I date.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.960]   You're gonna define the woman that I marry.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.360]   You're gonna find the man that I marry.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.720]   You're gonna find the way that I raise kids.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.040]   You are gonna define my life.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.400]   You are not a component or an accessory of life.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.600]   You are life.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:10.440]   If you ever find that life,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.120]   if you ever experienced that life,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.440]   the degree to which you and I experience that life
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.960]   will be the degree to which we walk in dependence on him.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.380]   He's not an accessory for life.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.040]   Christ, the Spirit of God working in your life
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.420]   is a necessity for life, not an accessory.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.260]   Let me pray that you know that, God.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.220]   Father, we thank you that you are working
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.700]   in the lives of young adults all over this town.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.260]   Thank you that you have worked in our lives,
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.580]   that you're continuing in your grace and kindness.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   You're patient with us, Lord,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.100]   because that's what the Spirit of God is.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.460]   He's so patient, Lord.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.800]   And that you provide strength where we're weak,
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.660]   you are strong.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.540]   You don't require us to do something,
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.340]   to reach deep down, like Shane said,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.420]   to our bootstraps and pull ourselves up and try harder.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.900]   You require us to just depend on you, to walk with you.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.440]   We're not strong enough in and of ourself.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.740]   We declare that and confess that to you, Lord.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.740]   We need your help.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.000]   We need you every moment.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.320]   You're worthy of all of our life,
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.220]   of all of our worship.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.340]   Will you help us to honor you
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.940]   in everything that we do, Lord?
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.320]   May we keep in step by step with you.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.240]   You're worthy of all of it.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.280]   And we just declare that and by faith,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.540]   ask for you to help us continue to walk that out.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.220]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
