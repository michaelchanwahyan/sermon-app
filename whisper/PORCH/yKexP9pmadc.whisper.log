[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   James is made up of 108 verses. 54 of them are imperatives. An imperative is a command.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   That Jesus was not just his half-brother, he was his Lord.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Yeah. If we haven't met, I'm the guy that used to be here, I used to carry out David's podium.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I want to start by just telling you how the porch has changed since I've left.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   It's gotten better in just about every way, man. I'm so humbled. I'm so humbled to be with you.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Let me start with a confession before I even dive in to the Scripture.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I love when you guys yell. I love when you yell for me.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Truly, there's something in my heart that is not good that loves that.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   The last thing that I want to do tonight is distract you from Jesus.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That's both completely wholeheartedly true, and then there's a part of it that's not true.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Because there's the part that wants you to love me. That's not just preacher-speak, that's not just talk.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Honestly, I was worshipping here as they were leading, and there's a weirdness to be back.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I'm just like, "Oh God, I love this so much, and I'm not sure that's good.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I want it to be good, but I love it for you, and I love the way you're moving."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So pray for me, pray for my heart, and pray mostly that I would not distract you from Jesus.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I hate waiting. So that's my second confession. I hate waiting on anything.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Anybody else hate waiting? What do you hate waiting for?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Food, traffic, traffic. I miss relationships in Dallas. I do not miss the traffic in Dallas.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But then if you're driving down 35th and Waco, you'll be waiting there too at times.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   What else do you hate waiting on? For him to propose. Is he here?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Is he here because we could try to pressure him into that right now.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So I don't know where you're watching from. I know there's like 18 campuses around the world.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Maybe you're in a living room, maybe you're gathered in some other city.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But I'm sure you hate waiting too. There's all kinds of things that I hate waiting for.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I hate going on YouTube to watch something, and then they give me this ad,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and I have to wait three seconds to skip the ad. But sometimes they won't let me skip the ad.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Like I got to watch the whole commercial, like it's 2010, you know.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's like I don't understand there's these different things.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I hate waiting for the line in the grocery store.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So I play this game where I'll go all the way down to see the aisles,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   to see who has the fewest stuff so that I don't wait.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And if I'm getting in the express lane, what I do is I start counting how many things they have in front of me.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Because if it's over, I judge them. And I'm angry that they made me late.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Like I do not like waiting. I hate for the traffic. You guys said that.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   But then there's also the stoplights. And it's like I'm trying to get somewhere,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and I hit the stoplight. So I play this game there too,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   where I look at the cars in the lanes, and I try to discern which one's faster.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And I'll get in behind. Anybody else do this?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Okay. Yeah. And I try to get in.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And you know, if one lane has three cars and one lane has two, like I'm certainly going to get behind.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So I mean, I try to pull in front of them. I do this maneuver.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I've been practicing my whole life since I was 16 for it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But I just don't like waiting. So you can imagine when COVID hit.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And I know we're sick of talking about COVID. I get it. We're tired of talking about it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But when it hit, it was really hard on me.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Okay. Especially when we had to quarantine. I'm an Enneagram 7 extrovert.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I want to go. I see you, dude. I see you. I know.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And so I'm sitting there one day, and I'm just hating life.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I'm like, God, is this a commercial for hell? You know?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And this deal comes across my laptop. And it's a travel deal to Mexico.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so I'm like, is this a gift? You know?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And so I book it without talking to my wife, without even looking at the calendar.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Because here's why. Because it was a 24-hour. You could cancel in 24 hours.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So I'm like, I'll book it. I'll go home. I'll pretend like it's a gift for her.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And then if she doesn't like the gift, I'll say, don't worry, I can return it. Right?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And she didn't like the gift. And so I went back to cancel it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But it said that I had to call to cancel.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So I called Orbitz, or a company who should remain nameless.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And they put me on hold.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And so I waited. I waited for an hour.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And then I had to hang up.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So then I called them back that night at 6 p.m.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And they put me on hold.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And then I eventually talked to somebody.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And she said, hey, you can't cancel because you're outside your 24-hour window.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I said, I'm an hour outside of my 24-hour window because you put me on hold for three hours.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And I said, I need to talk to a manager.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   They said, well, the manager won't be in for a couple hours.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I said, that's okay. I'll wait. I'm used to it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Guess how long I was on hold for?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Three hours? Four hours?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That's a lot. Right? That's a long time. Four hours.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Ain't nobody got time for that.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Nine hours! I was on hold for nine hours.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Now I know you think, oh, pastors don't do anything. You've got all this time.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   No, no. From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. I sat on -- I'm not going to give up.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You're past the point of no return, right, at that point.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I'm like, no, I'm going to stay on hold until we figure this thing out.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And it paid off because eventually I escalated to the owner of Orbitz.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And they gave me -- true story, true story -- they gave me $900 cash for waiting on hold.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I was like, I'll take it. I know, it's a crazy story, right?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   But I don't like waiting. And I know that you're here tonight,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and some of you feel like that's trivial because you're waiting for something way bigger than that.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Maybe for him to propose.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You're waiting for marriage. Okay?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Maybe you're waiting to have sex.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Maybe you've gone to God with something and you feel like he put you on hold.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And you're just waiting. You're like, Lord, when are you going to answer this prayer?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Right? And God, don't you see what's happening in the world?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's getting out of control. So like, Jesus, if you want to come back, come on back.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm so tired of waiting. Maybe you're waiting for your parents to reconcile.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Maybe you're waiting for someone to come and say, hey, I'm really sorry for what I did to you.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Let me just ask you. And you don't have to answer out loud this time.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But I do want you to answer. What are you waiting for?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   What's the biggest angst of waiting that you have right now?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I want everybody to answer. Think of it in your head. What is it?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What do you feel like God's slow on?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Let me give you just a second to think about that.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The greatest angst in your heart, the biggest thing that you're waiting for, whether you realize it or not,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   is for Jesus to come back. And I know that feels like a Jesus juke.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Like, I get it. You're like, no, that really wasn't my answer.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   It really was for him to propose. But in that moment, everything is resolved and there's nothing else you're waiting for.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   There is no conversation with God. Why didn't you let me get married?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Why didn't you let me have sex? Why didn't you bring him back to say I'm sorry?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Why did you do that to me? No, no, no. In that moment, when you're face to face with the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   everything in resolve, there is no angst left in your heart.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And so that is the thing that you're waiting for.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So in this series, we're moving through the book of James. We're in chapter five.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   If you want to turn there with me, we call this the full truth from the half brother, which is a brilliant name.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Last week, Josh did a great job taking us through verses one through six in chapter five.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We got to hear rodeo stories from the past. You will hear no rodeo stories tonight.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I have none. As we look at this text, this section,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I want to talk about how we wait for resolution as Christians.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We want God to fix all this, all the broken things that we say, all the broken things that we see in the world.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And the answer to the question, the points that I'm going to put before you is we wait with patience.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   We wait with hope and we wait with integrity. That's what the Holy Spirit is going to say through James.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   James is Jesus's half brother. This is the first epistle that shows up in the New Testament,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   meaning it was written earliest about 45 A.D. It's known as the New Testament book of Proverbs or book of wisdom.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's also known as a commentary on the Sermon on the Mount. James, his half brother, Jesus, gave a sermon.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And he wrote this commentary to that. And so this is where we've been.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And I'll just start in verse seven. Be patient. Underline that if you have a pen. Patient.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Be patient then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient. Underline that word patient.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And stand firm because the Lord's coming is near. Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   The judge is standing at the door. And it has everyone's favorite illustration baked in.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You know, the one about farming, because we're all farmers and we do horse stuff and that kind of thing.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And so, yeah, shout out. And so, I know we don't know much about farming,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   but in this day, when this was written in an agrarian culture, you would plant the seed.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   You would plow the field. You would plant the seed. You would wait. You would pray for rain.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You would wait for the crop to grow so that you could harvest the crop.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   There was a lot of doing and a lot of waiting. And there was a part that you were responsible for.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And then there was a part that was absolutely and completely out of your control,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   which is a great metaphor for us to walk in faithfulness. We take care of faithfulness.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   The bullseye, the goal for our lives is to be faithful and let God be God because we're not God.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Right. We can't do what is out of our control. And the word that is repeated there is what?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   It's patience. And so, number one, we wait with patience.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   We wait with patience.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   There's two word for patience in the Greek. Hupomone and Makrithomeo.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Hupomone and Makrithomeo. Makrithomeo is the word that is here.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's not just patience like we think of patience. It's waiting with a long temper.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And you think, what does that mean with a long temper? Well, what does it mean if someone has a short temper?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Everybody knows somebody with a short temper. Don't set me up, man. You better not go there.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Now, you don't know who you're messing with. That's the short temper guy. Don't date him.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Okay. It literally translates a long fuse.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So we know what it is to have a short fuse, but to have a long fuse, like you can't set me off.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I can be patient under suffering. That's the word here.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   We wait patiently for the Lord to return under suffering, long suffering.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   We're able to endure hardship.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And waiting with patience, Makrithomeo, means not to turn on each other.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   That's a word for 2020. Be patient and stand firm.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Because, why do I be patient and stand firm? Because, here's the reason why.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Let me tell you why. The Lord's coming is near.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Now, here's the reality. That was written 2,000 years ago.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   But when you compare 2,000 years to eternity, it is but a second.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So if Jesus comes back tomorrow, or if he comes back 10,000 years, relatively speaking, it is still very close.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And so don't turn on each other. Let me give you a hot take.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It's going to get weird for just a minute.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   What I think happened in the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, this is just my opinion.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So take it for what it's worth. Just my opinion.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I can't chapter and verse this, which is dangerous.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I think Satan, the devil, pulled all the spiritual evil forces together, all the demons.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And he said, "You guys ready? We just want to unleash the spirit of division on the land.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   You ready? That's what we're going to do. That's our one strategy. Just divide them.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Turn black against white, Republican against Democrat.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Divide the churches. Turn husband against wife, father against son.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Just divide them. Just divide them. Just divide them."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And as people have said, "Well, we are more divided as a country than we've been in a very, very long time."
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's working.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And it's like we've given up waiting.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   He says, "Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The judge is standing at the door. The judge is standing at the door.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So don't grumble against each other."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Now, any teachers in the room? Anybody teach a classroom today?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I love it, man. Okay, there's a lot of you.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   So we're in a classroom today.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Hey, let me ask you guys, the teachers, a question.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   How long can you leave the classroom?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Never? What grade?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Fourth graders? Yeah, you can't leave long.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   High school, you still can't leave long, right?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And for the rest of us who aren't teachers, we remember.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Like the teacher leaves the class, and you remember, "Hey, you guys be good.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I've got to run to the principal's office real quick.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Stay in your seat. Be good."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Leaves the classroom, and at first it's quiet.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You know, at first it's quiet.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And then people start talking a little bit.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And then they start talking a lot a bit.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And then it gets loud, and all of a sudden you're up out of your seat.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And maybe push comes to shove over here.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   There's some conflict. "What did you say about me?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Hey, you call my girl? What'd you do?"
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And then you're like this, right?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And you've got the fist cocked back.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And then the teacher walks in.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And I don't care what happened before that.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It doesn't look good for you.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Okay? You're in trouble at that point.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And this is what he's saying.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   "I'm standing at the door, guys.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I see you.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I see what you said about her.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I see what you thought about him.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   What are you doing, man?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   What happened to be diligent to preserving the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Why are you so divisive?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   What are you doing? Guys, I'm at the door. I see you."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   What do you want to be doing when Jesus comes back?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Where do you want to be?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   What do you want to be listening to?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   What do you want to be watching?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Who do you want to be with?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And maybe you're like, "Honestly, JP, I wish he'd hurry up.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Like, let's get this show on the road.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   What's he waiting on? He said he's at the door that he's going to return soon.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   What are we waiting on?"
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He promised. He promised.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Why doesn't he keep his promise?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I have a verse for you. 2 Peter 3, 9.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It says, "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises, as some understand slowness.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   But he's patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   So it's actually God being patient with you.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Like, he's waiting for you to go on mission, for you to go everywhere and tell everyone about Jesus,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   for you to begin to share your faith, for you to begin to live with a purpose.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And I know you're like, "Wait, no. But he needs to deal with evil, man.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   You don't know what happened to me. You don't know what they did to me."
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   You want God to deal with evil? Who wants God to deal with evil?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You want God to deal with evil? Where does he start?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Does he start with the rapist or the person who looked at pornography?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Oh, you want him to start with the murderer or the one who gossiped?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Where do you want him to start?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Because this is the way we work.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   We draw a line in the sand and we say, "God, deal with all that evil."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   But if God dealt with evil right now, he'd deal with you.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   That's the whole point of us. We need a Savior.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   We're desperate for a Savior.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   If God dealt with evil right now, if he abolished evil, I wouldn't be here.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He'd deal with me.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And he'd deal with you.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But it's hard. I do know. I realize. I understand the world is broken.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   That's why he says in verse 10, "Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   He said, "You want an example of people who waited under suffering?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Look at the prophets in the Word."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You remember, we could talk about the prophets.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   We'll go with Noah. Remember Noah?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   He's the one who built the big boat called an ark.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I don't know if you realize this, but it had never rained.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And God says, "Hey, I want you to build an ark."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So he spends his life, like his lot in life is to build a giant boat.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So he starts building it and everybody's making fun of him.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   "What are you doing, Noah? Building a boat in the middle of the land? You crazy man."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And it is his lot in life to be canceled.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Everybody is just basically making fun of him.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   He's like, "No, guys, you don't understand. It's going to rain."
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   They're like, "What's rain?"
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And so he finishes the boat. They put all the animals on it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And he closes the door. And do you know what happened?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   You know what happened?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Anybody know what happened?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   No. Nothing happened.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   For days, they closed the door and nothing happened.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Now you imagine a conversation with your wife.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   "Hey, Noah, you sure you didn't say, 'Go buy some art?'"
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   "You sure you said, 'Build an ark, bud,' because nothing's..."
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Yeah, he was ridiculed.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   But he operated in faithfulness.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   what the Lord finally brought about.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   This word "perseverance," here we see the word "hupamone."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's often translated "patience" as well.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But he says, "Look at the example of the prophets."
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   "They wait with hope." They know what's coming.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   They know Jesus is coming back. And that's my second point.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Wait with hope. We wait with hope.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   As the classroom goes in disarray,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   as everyone starts to bicker and they're up out of their seats,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   the good students, they sit there patiently at their desk,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   hoping that the teacher is quick to return.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I hope they come quick and bring order. That's our role.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   God, please, pray, Lord, please come back quickly
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and make sense of all of this mess.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Because it's messy, because there's cancer, and there's heartbreak,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   and there's death of loved ones.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And at some point, you're going to have a crisis of faith
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   where you're going to be like, "Why does God let this happen?"
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   "If he's a good God, why is the world so broken?"
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Do you ever feel that way? Why is the world so broken?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Let me give you a good, sound theological answer to that.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Genesis chapter 3.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   The fall. Sin entered the world.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   The world is not as it should be. Your theology has to be good.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Jesus said what he promised you is in this world you will have trouble.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So when you have trouble, you should be like,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   "Jesus, thank you for keeping your promises. Thank you for giving me a heads up."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Who's going to have trouble? Christians, followers of Jesus,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   God's children will have trouble.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   The Christian life is not the easy life.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   It's not like once you prayed to receive Jesus, now it's like easy street.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   So even God's people suffer.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   In comparison, honestly guys, what I would tell you is all we do is suffer.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Comparatively speaking to being in the presence of God,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I mean really your happiest moment here is going to feel like suffering in the kingdom.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   That's good news.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   If you have Jesus, if you've trusted in him for his death and resurrection,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   for the forgiveness of your sins, a payment for your sins,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   this is as bad as it will ever be.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   But if you're here tonight and you haven't yet placed your faith in Jesus,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   believing that he suffered for your sins so that you don't have to suffer for your sins,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   if you haven't done that yet, this is as good as it will ever be.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   This is your heaven.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you die.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That's a sobering reality.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And so we suffer, we endure hardships knowing that Jesus is going to come back and make it okay.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   This is what it says, verse 11.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And then he gives us a specific example.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   You guys know the story of Job?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Kind of a beatdown of a book.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Let me just go ahead and give you that heads up.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   What happens, Satan is like, "Hey, God, nobody loves you."
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And God's like, "Job loves me."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And Satan's like, "Well, he wouldn't love you if I messed with him."
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And God's like, "Wait for it. Go ahead."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   That's confusing.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And so Satan does begin to mess with him.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And you see this unfold.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And this is a story in the scripture. It actually happened.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And so Job, he's in misery for months.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   He has these open sores all over him.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And he begins to pick his scabs with shards of pottery.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And seven of his sons die.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And three of his daughters die.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   And all of his wealth vanished in one afternoon.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   He put it all on Dogecoin and it just vanished.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Like it was just gone, right?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And so he becomes repulsive to his wife.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He's hated by his friends.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And even little children despised him as he lay on the ash heap outside of town.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And this is what he says.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   "I know that my Redeemer lives."
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "And that in the end, He will stand on the earth."
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "I myself will see Him with my own eyes, I and not another, how my heart yearns within me."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And God restores him. It says at the back of the book.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   God restores him. He gets everything back two times.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And I'm still like, "That's a bad deal."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Because he doesn't get his sons back. He doesn't get his daughters back.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   His marriage is wrecked.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And so like...
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And this is why, you've got to hear me on this.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   This is why eternity is the great equalizer.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   This is why James says, "Life is but a vapor."
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   It's that long.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You're here for but a moment.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   You guys don't even know your great-great-grandfather's name.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Right? And he was alive 50 years ago.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Your life is so short.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Nobody's going to remember you. The deaths you return.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   It all comes down to, "What did you do with Jesus?"
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   A hundred years from now, the only thing that matters...
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   It won't matter your shoes if you've got the latest Air Force 1s or the Yeezys or Golden Goose.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   What's going to matter a hundred years from now is, "What did you do with Jesus?"
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   "What did you do with Him?"
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   "What did you say about Him?"
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Because I've got to tell you something that I don't think is taught very often.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You're in the Job experiment.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Don't you guys understand that?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   We're in the same experiment Job's in.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Let me explain it.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   See, Lucifer was the greatest of angels.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   He's in heaven with God.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And he's an angel.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And he says to God, "God, I don't want to worship you. I want to be worshipped."
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   "I want to be like you."
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Pride was the sin that made the devil the devil.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And so God says, "Oh, you want to be God? Let's see what kind of God you are."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And he sends him to earth.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And God creates people.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And God's like, "Let's see who they worship."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   "Will they worship the God of this world, or the prince of this air, or will they worship me?"
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   This is what the Scripture says about Satan in 2 Corinthians 4, verse 4.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   "The God of this world..." Who is that?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   That's Satan.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   In Ephesians 2, verse 2, it says,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "In which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Who is that?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   That's Satan.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   See, Satan has authority here.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And he's trying to lure you astray.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He's attacking you.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   He has one motive.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   He has one strategy.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   To not let you worship or follow God.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   To not allow you to trust in Jesus.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He wants to steal, kill, and destroy.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   You're in the same experiment.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Who am I going to worship? God, or the God of this world?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   You're just in the same experiment as Job.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Don't you understand?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So who's winning?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And this is why you've got to make this deal right now.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   What has to happen for you to follow God?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Let me say it in a different way.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   What has to happen for you not to follow God?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Let me say it like this.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   What has to happen for you to turn away from God?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Say, "God, if you don't do that, then I'm out."
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Or, "If you do that, then I'm out."
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "You don't let me get married, I'm not going to follow you."
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   "You don't let me have children, nah."
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   "You don't give me the promotion, nope."
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Nope. Nope.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   "I'm going to follow you. I'm going to go to the porch every Tuesday."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   "Church every Sunday. Community group. I'm going to be a member."
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "But if you do this, I'm out."
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   What is it?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   What is it?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Because you'd be better off saying what it is right now.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And just being really honest.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "God, this is what it is. I'll tell you what I love more than you do."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   "I'll tell you what I love more than you."
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   When I do a wedding.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   When I do a wedding.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Lots of premarital counseling.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   When he asks, call me.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I say this. Listen, this is important.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   I say, "Hey, what would you guys divorce over?"
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   To which, you know, they're like, "Nothing. We love each other, man."
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I'm like, "Okay. Like truly nothing?"
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I look to her, I'm like, "Hey, what would you leave him for?"
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Right? Because we're going to say these vows.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   You're going to say, you know, "For richer or poorer, in sickness and health, till death do us part."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Do you mean that? Like, what would you leave him for?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   She's like, "I wouldn't leave him for anything. I love him."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "I love him with all my heart."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   "He's my lobster. Like, you don't understand."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And I say, "Cool. Let me ask you."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   "So he cheats on you with your sister and makes a TikTok out of it. We still good?"
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "We still good?"
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And she's like, "Well, maybe that."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And I'm like, "Cool, cool."
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Because we're going to throw that in the vows.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   You know, "For richer or poorer, in sickness and health, till death do us part, unless he cheats on me with my sister and makes a TikTok."
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And I'm just going to say that in front of all your friends.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Because let's just be honest, man.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Let's just keep it real, okay?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Like 100. Let's just be completely.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So God, here's the deal.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I'm going to follow you with all of my life, unless...
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And what are you putting there?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And you've got to answer that.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   What's the "unless"?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Because, here's why.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   That's where Satan is going to attack you.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   That's what he's going...
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   That's where he's coming after you.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And I know that that should be.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It should be a little unsettling.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Except for, greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   That's the good news.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   That's the good news.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And so you can say, like Job did,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   He will stand on the earth, and after my skin has been destroyed,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   yet in my flesh I will see God.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I myself will see Him with my own eyes.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I am not another.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   How my heart yearns within me.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   My Redeemer lives."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   He lives.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   James says, verse 12,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   "Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   not by heaven or by earth, or by anything else.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   All you need to say is a simple yes or no,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   otherwise you will be condemned."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Boom.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I was like, what does that mean?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   How did he go there?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Because he's like, "Jesus is coming back.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   He's standing at the door.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Be on your best behavior.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Make sure that you know Him.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Oh, and by the way, don't pinky promise.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   You know, just say yes, no."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   I was like, that's a weird...
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Why is he saying that?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Why did he go there?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Because he's saying, "Hey, God keeps His promises,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   so you keep your promises.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   God keeps His word,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   so you better keep your word."
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Number three, he says, "Wait with integrity."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Wait with integrity.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Remember, Jesus' half-brother is writing a commentary
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   on the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And so in Matthew 5, verse 37, Jesus says,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "Let your yes be yes and your no be no."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   He says, "Keep your word."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   The reason that your yes can be trusted
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   is because you do what you say you're going to do.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And I don't know if you realize how important integrity is
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   in the Christian life,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   but the gospel is the way that the Holy Spirit saves people.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And the gospel is actually a story,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   that you're a sinner separated from God by your sin,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and God loved you so much
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   that He doesn't want to punish you for your sin.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   He sent His own Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   to be punished in your place for the abortion,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   for the sex, for prom night,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   for what you did yesterday or on the way here,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   what you said about her or what you thought about Him.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   The thing you stole, the person you killed,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Jesus died for that.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   That's the good news.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And it's a story.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   I'm sharing with you the story.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And I'm sharing with you the story of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   who is the one who's going to save you
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   from the grave.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And if you trust in that,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   then you don't have to pay for your sins in hell.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Because the only thing that you can do in hell
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   is pay for your sins forever.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   So the only person who doesn't go to hell
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   is the person whose sins have been paid for.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   It's not like good people go to heaven
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and bad people go to hell.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Good and bad people in hell,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   good and bad people in heaven,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   they're going to be like, "Dude,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   "I mean, you flaked out on me last Friday.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   "You're telling me this dude came back to life?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   "For real?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   "Guess what, man, I got to tell you something.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   "I don't trust you.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   "And I don't trust your gospel."
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Before anybody trusts in Christ,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   they trust a Christian.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   That's why he says this here.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Before anybody is going to place their faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   they're going to be communicated that message
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   by a Christian.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Some of you are here, right?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And you're like, "No, I've been hurt by the church."
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Man, you don't understand.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   I've been hurt by the church.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Anybody know anybody who's been hurt by the church?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Anybody know somebody who's been hurt by the church?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Yeah, guess what?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   No, you don't.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   You don't know anybody that's been hurt by the church.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   It's not like their whole church,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   like, you know, First Baptist, Ulist,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   "Hey, gather everyone up.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "Come on, everybody line up,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "and let's just make fun of them, call them names."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   You're of a church.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So you weren't hurt by the church.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   You were hurt by the church's representative,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   a member of the church, right?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   That's very important
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   because people are going to disappoint you.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   But when you're that person,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   when you disappoint someone,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   you go back to them and you say,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   "Hey, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   "I did not let my yes be yes.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "Will you please forgive me?"
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Because you steward
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   the most important message
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   that has ever been told
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   in the history of the world.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   For God so loved the world
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   that he gave his only begotten Son
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   that whoever believes in him,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   whoever believes in him,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   whoever believes in him
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   shall not perish,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   but have eternal life.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And the way they're going to believe in him
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   is if they believe you when you talk about him.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   So let your yes be yes,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and your no be no,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   and do what you say you're going to do
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   as you steward the gospel.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Jesus kept his commitment
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   to die for our sins.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And he kept his commitment
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   to come back to life.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And he will keep his commitment
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   to return again.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   One day, I don't know when,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I hope it's before you get to your car,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   the sky's going to crack open like a scroll
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   and you're going to see
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   the Son of Man coming on a white horse
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and you're going to see
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   the Son of Man coming on a white horse
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   and a robe dipped in blood
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   with a sick tat
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   that says
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   "The King of Kings, Lord of Lords."
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Man, it's going to be awesome.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   And so live like he's coming back, friends.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Live like he's coming back.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Have you ever seen the movie "Cast Away"?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I'm just curious now,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   by show of hands,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   how many people have you seen it?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So a lot of you,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   because I'm going to totally ruin it,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   because it's 20 years old.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So it came out when you were born.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   You've had 20 years to see it,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   so if I ruin it, it's not my fault.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   That's your fault.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   And so it's Tom Hanks,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Woody from "Toy Story."
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So Woody from "Toy Story,"
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   he's trapped on a deserted island.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Man, true story, there's nobody else there,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   like shipwreck, he's on this deserted island
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   all by himself.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He's so lonely, he becomes best friends
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   with a volleyball, "Wilson!"
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   For years and years and years.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And he's got a family, right?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   He's separated from his family, all by himself,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   on a deserted island, nobody comes to save him.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   But here's the part where I ruin it.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Somebody actually does come to save him eventually,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and they get him, and they're taking him home to his family.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And it's this big, climactic, epic moment
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   where he's about to meet his wife,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and it's everything that you thought it would be.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   It's raining, and they lock eyes from across the parking lot,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   and they get, and they run, and they embrace,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   and it's this amazing embrace,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   and then they start making out, right?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And it's raining, and it's incredible,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   and then she stops kissing him, and she looks him in the eyes,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and she says, "I knew you would come back.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   "I knew you would come back."
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   But then it gets weird.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Because she's married.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   "I know.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   "I know.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   "She moved on."
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Which tells me what?
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   She didn't know.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And so if you're here,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and you're like, "I know Jesus is coming back.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   "I know he's coming back."
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But you date however you want.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You say whatever you want.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   You do whatever you want.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   You spin however you want.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You compare however you want.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   You do not believe he's coming back.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Your words say one thing.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Your life says something else.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You gotta know that, man.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   He's coming back
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   before you know it.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   So in summary,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   wait with patience.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   End your suffering.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Wait with hope.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Believing that he's coming back.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And wait with integrity.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   So that you can be trusted.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   It's really like,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   if I had to summarize all of those,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   it's like,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   wait with the confidence
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   that Jesus is coming back.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   You feel that?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Wait with hope.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   You feel that?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I became a Christian
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   at this church.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And as a young adult.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   That's why I'm so passionate about
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   the season of life that you're in.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But I wasn't always a Christian
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   as a young adult, and so
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I was amazing at being an unbeliever.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   So I partied really hard,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and one night,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   my boys and I, we were at the Village Country Club.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And so, you know the village apartments,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   there's a bar there, that's where we were at.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And, um, is it still there?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Okay, good.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   (laughter)
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Or not good, I don't know.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And so we're there,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and we really had two objectives
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   when we went out.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It was either to take a girl home,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   or to get in a fight.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Those were the two things we were focused on doing
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   when we went out, okay?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Stop judging me, man, I didn't know Jesus.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And so we were out,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   and as usual,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   no girls took interest.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And so,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   my buddy's walking around
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   the club, and he's the littlest one of us,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   okay, I gotta tell you,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   he's pretty small.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   But he's intoxicated, he's had too much to drink,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   and he's doing that weird thing that guys do
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   where he's walking around like this, you know?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   And he's just, he's walking around the club like this,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   just looking for something.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And so he finds the one guy in the bar, smaller than him,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   and he does this dumb thing that guys do.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He's like, "What are you looking at?"
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   You know?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   It's brilliant, right?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And so next thing you know, they're chest to chest,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   about to make out,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   breathing heavy into each other's face, right?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And I see it, so I go over there,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and I separate them.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, not tonight, man.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   "I'm gonna take you home, bro, you've had too much to drink,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   "I'm gonna get you home."
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And so I separate them, and this guy goes,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   "Hey, don't you touch me."
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And I'm like,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   "Hey, no, it's cool, man, he's had too much,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   "I'm sorry for whatever he said,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "I'm gonna take him home, we're gonna go home,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   "keep doing your thing, man,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   "you look like you're having a good time, keep going at it."
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And I turn my back for one second,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   and they're back at it again, about to make out,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and so I go, and I go,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   and I separate them again,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I push them back,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and this guy goes,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "I told you, don't you touch me."
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And I'm like,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   "Bro."
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   "Why are you doing that, man?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "I'm trying to take my friend home,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "and you're over here slapping my hand away,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   "and like, don't,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   "like, don't, don't be that way."
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And hey, he did the craziest thing
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I've ever seen anybody do in this situation, right?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   He looks at me straight in the eyes,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and he pulls out his cell phone,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   and he does this,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and he's just looking at me like this.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "Hey, you here?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   "All right, I got something I need you to take care of."
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   And he hangs up, I know, I know,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I was like, "Who'd you, was that your dad?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "Who'd you call?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   "Was that Batman? Like, what did you do?"
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And like, if I'm totally honest with you,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   like, his confidence was unsettling to me.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I'm like, he knows something I don't know,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   so I'm scared at this point, truly, I'm like,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   "Hey, guys, we gotta go!
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   "He called somebody, I don't know who, we gotta go!"
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And we're all surrounded up, like, they believe me,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   they see I'm kinda panicked, and so we're like,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "All right, we're going." And I saw who he called!
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I saw who he called!
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   These two cartoon characters get out of a truck, right?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Like, they had school buses for breakfast,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   you know, like,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   they eat steroids, I don't know,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and they're yoked up,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   they're taller than me,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   you know, got muscle shirts on, you know?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And one dude has a chain,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   not like this kind of chain,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   like a chain you pull a car with,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   like this right here, a padlock, I'm not even kidding, right?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   And they go, and he gets out of the car,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   he's like, "Are these the guys?"
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I was like, "No, they left, they went that way."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   (laughter)
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And I'm like, "Why?"
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   It's like all of the sudden
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I knew why that guy was so resolved.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   He had so much peace about him.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   It's like he was saying,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "Whatever you're gonna do to me,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   "you're not gonna do it long."
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   You hear that?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's like what he was saying,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   he was like, "Hey, you don't understand,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   "like I got somebody coming.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "Whatever you're about to do to me,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   "you're not gonna do it long.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   "Can you
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "look Satan
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   "in the eyes right now
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   "and say that?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   "Whatever you're gonna do to me,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   "you're not gonna do it long.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   "My Redeemer lives.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "I'm gonna see him again.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   "Don't you know, bro?"
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Listen, he keeps his promises.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   He keeps his promises.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   You know how I know he keeps his promises,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   by the way, Mr. Lucifer?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Okay, he died
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   on a cross for me.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   He died on a cross.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And I know you were happy about that.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   You thought you won for a minute,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   but then boom, he came back to life
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and you lose.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And I placed my faith in him.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   So whatever you're gonna
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   do to me for my little 76 years,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   you wanna keep me single?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   That's fine.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   You wanna keep me celibate? That's fine.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   You wanna keep me poor?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   That's okay.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You wanna keep me forgotten?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I'm not forgotten, dude. Don't you see?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   The creator of the heavens and the earth knows my name.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   See, he wrote in a book.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   He sealed my soul with his Holy Spirit.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   He formed me in my
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   mother's womb. He knows how many hairs are on my head.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   But before
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   creation,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   he created me for a purpose,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   to live for him. I'm not gonna
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   fall for your stupid tricks.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Not today.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Not ever.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I'm not gonna lose hope.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I will wait with patience.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I will wait with hope.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   And I will wait
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   with integrity.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Because my redeemer lives.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And he keeps his promises.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Father, help us
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   believe that. Because I bet
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   when I say
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   celibacy,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   that's scary.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Singleness.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Poor.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Forgotten. Nobody wants that.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   We don't want that.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   That's not what we want.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   But we follow
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Jesus, and what he said
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   to you was not my will,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   but thy will.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And so, okay.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Here's my
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   real ask.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Will you protect us
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   from
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   the enemy?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Will you protect us from the enemy?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And will you help us
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   to never stop loving
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   you? And will
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   you help us to never stop looking
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   for the return of your savior?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   In Jesus' name,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   amen.
