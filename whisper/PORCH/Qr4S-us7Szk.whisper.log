[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.800]   All right, Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   Amazing.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800]   Hey, it's so great to be here with you.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.000]   Thanks for making the time to join us here.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.200]   Those of you that are in the room,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200]   it's always a pleasure to spend a little bit of time with you.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   But all of you that are tuning in online,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   thanks for giving us your evening as well.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.200]   We're so grateful to be a part of a generation where God is
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   doing something really significant.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   That's kind of what we've been journeying through as we've
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.800]   been looking at this series.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400]   But before I get ahead of myself,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.100]   let me give a special shout out,
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.300]   not just to those of you tuning online,
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.100]   but also Portslie, Greater Lafayette, Fresno, and Scottsdale.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.700]   God is doing a great thing here.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.200]   He is doing a great thing in so many different places,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   and we're just glad to be a part of it.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hey, let me just lead off with this.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200]   The topic that we're working through tonight is of considerable
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.100]   importance. And because that's the case,
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.700]   I don't necessarily want us to rush all the way through it.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600]   I sat down and I considered, man,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   what can I cut from this thing?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   And I had others do the same alongside of me.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.500]   And we said, no,
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.000]   there's not much here that we feel like we can discard.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.200]   We believe that God wants to speak to you from the passage
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   we're going to study.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.500]   And it might just take a little bit of time,
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.800]   but sometimes things deserve an extended opportunity for the
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.300]   Lord to work.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.600]   But before I get there,
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   let me just open up with a story.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.300]   You might be sitting there thinking to yourself,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.700]   "Kylin, did you get a little sun this weekend?"
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.400]   And the answer would be, "Yes, I did get some sun this weekend,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.300]   but not by way of how most people would.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.900]   I wasn't sitting by the pool.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.800]   I wasn't sipping something nice.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.300]   I wasn't working on my tan."
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000]   You see, this white boy,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.100]   he burns much faster than you might think.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.900]   I was actually outside working on a construction project that
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.100]   I've taken upon myself.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.600]   I am trying to build a covered pergola for my back patio,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.400]   which has been awesome.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.600]   I enjoy working with my hands.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.200]   It's been great for me to dust off some of the old skills that
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.900]   I developed on the old family farm in East Texas.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.500]   And it's been cool to work through some problems that I've
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.200]   encountered as I've been trying to bring my vision into reality.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.300]   It's always fun to measure twice and cut once and realize,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.200]   "Man, I should have measured three times to try to figure out
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.300]   what's the alternative solution."
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.500]   There's something really rewarding in looking at what you're
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.100]   building by way of the sweat of your brow.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.500]   You know, like I have enjoyed this process and by way of me
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.600]   doing it on my own,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.000]   I am saving a lot of money,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.100]   which is just a small addition to why this matters.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.600]   You see, it has not financially cost me nearly what it would if
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200]   I had contracted it out and had someone come do it instead.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.500]   But, and there's a big but here, it has cost me nonetheless.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.400]   You see, this is not just your run-of-the-mill, average
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.100]   Saturday afternoon chore where you roll up your sleeves and
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.000]   you give it the good college try for a few hours.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.500]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.700]   This is a major construction project, the likes of which has
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.200]   led me to become a Home Depot Pro member.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.100]   One where I'm not just building something that is constructed,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.300]   but I'm also running electric.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.200]   I'm trying to prepare something, the likes of which we will
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.100]   enjoy, not just for a little while, but for a long while.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.100]   And because that's the case, it has cost me far more than I
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.300]   ever expected whenever I initially agreed to this.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.900]   It has cost me, in the realm of long weekends where I could
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.600]   be doing other things, but instead I'm doing this.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   It has cost me hours outside of the gym.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.300]   It has cost me one Memorial Day trip to the lake.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.900]   And if I'm not careful, it's going to cost me something
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.400]   that's happening on July 4th too.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   I have to work quickly because this project is costing me
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.000]   at a level I did not expect.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.300]   So then why do I keep doing it?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.700]   Because there's not much return on value for a half-finished
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.500]   patio cover when it comes to property value.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.200]   You know, like I need to make sure that I get it done.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.800]   But in addition to that, what I'm learning is that there
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.500]   are some things worth a considerable cost.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.800]   I'm realizing like the hope of what we'll be hosting friends
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.300]   over and sitting out on our back patio as the sun goes down
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.100]   and enjoying dinner.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100]   That's something I'm really looking forward to.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.600]   Or getting it done in time for the fall so I can watch college
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.400]   football with other friends and we can enjoy the cool of
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   the evening in America's favorite pastime.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900]   I'm looking forward to or the dream of hanging up my son's
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.100]   baby swing on the I-beam that goes over the front of it
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.500]   is exciting.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.600]   These are things that help me to look at all that it is
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.800]   requiring me, how much a cost I'm actually incurring in
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.700]   saying this project is worth it.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.900]   Anyways, the vision of what I have one day is well worth
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.300]   the value of what I'm losing right now.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   Why do I tell you all that?
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.100]   Because in the Christian life, there are seasons of time,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.900]   chapters that you will live where you voluntarily endorse
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   some considerable cost for a very considerable purpose.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.800]   Just like no one was forcing me to build this patio.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.000]   I could have hired it out.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   You too will want to build something in your life, but it
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   will cost you.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   It will require you to opt into inconvenience.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.700]   It will force you to give up some measure of comfort and
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.600]   it's ultimately going to put you in a position where you
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.000]   self-select out of what you could have in order to have
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.100]   what you want to have.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.300]   So what is it that you might build?
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.500]   You're going to build a consecrated life, a consecrated
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.700]   life, which is a life of uncommon devotion to God.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.100]   That's what consecration is.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.600]   Not a word that we use very frequently today, something
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   you probably haven't read aside from the scriptures themselves.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.000]   And yet there is something worth building into your life,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.600]   which is called consecration and it is defined as an uncommon
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.500]   devotion to God.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.100]   And the emphasis as we talk about that definition is really
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.900]   in the word uncommon because although there are seasons of
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.200]   consecration riddled throughout the scriptures, there are
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.800]   very few seasons of consecration riddled throughout our lives.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.200]   It is a normality when you open the pages of this book, but
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   it's an abnormality when you consider the pages of your
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.800]   story.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.700]   And the reason for that is really understandable.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.700]   Consecration is hard.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.900]   It's hard, not just hard to learn about.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.700]   That's actually not as difficult, but it is a very hard
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.400]   thing to live.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.500]   It's a hard thing to apply.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.900]   You see, we live in a society that is saturated by and are
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.300]   part of a generation that is infatuated with comfort, whether
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.600]   it's skipping anything longer than a six-second advertisement
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.700]   on your favorite YouTube video or making sure that your
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.400]   groceries are only available at curbside so you never actually
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.200]   have to walk inside the store or raging against Apple because
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.100]   how dare they only release one episode every single week.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.600]   I want all of the episodes right now.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.400]   We have become incredibly comfortable in our culture.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.700]   And listen, I'm not self-righteous about this.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.300]   I'm not a hater to this reality.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.700]   I love the fact that I can prime anything I need to my door
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.000]   at this moment.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.600]   And yet we live in a comfort culture that is selling our
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.800]   generation on the idea that stress is bad.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.700]   That anything less than good must be toxic.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.100]   And if you're struggling, you should stop.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.400]   That's what our culture is telling us.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.600]   And that's just not true.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.500]   In fact, what we know is it's actually false.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.100]   The scriptures would tell us that anything worth having is
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.700]   going to require something of you.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.400]   And that which is most worthy of having, which is God himself,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.300]   that which we would love to lay our hands upon, is worthy of
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.600]   giving up as much as we can in order to grab hold of him.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.900]   You see, the life that you want is not the life that the world
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.500]   is promising.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.200]   It's not a life of comfort and ease.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.300]   That life that's brimming with potential, that's boasting
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.800]   really great promise, that's packed with all the kind of
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.500]   passion you want to characterize your story, the life that
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.900]   Jesus has come to give you.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.600]   And yet the life that so often we settle so much less for,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.800]   that life, it comes by way of consecration, not by way of
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.500]   comfort.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   And so tonight I want to talk to you about this idea of
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.300]   consecration.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.800]   I want to help you understand how do you actually live into
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.500]   this kind of reality where you can experience the sort of
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.600]   life that so many of us want for.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.900]   In order to do it, we're going to look at what the Apostle
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.300]   Paul says in his letter to Timothy.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.000]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to 2 Timothy
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   chapter 2. While you're doing that, we've been in a series
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.600]   called Revive, where we're studying the principles of personal
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   renewal. And the reason why we've been looking at personal
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.800]   renewal is because we're firm believers that you do not find
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.100]   revival by seeking revival.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.600]   You find revival by seeking renewal. As we've been saying,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.400]   it's sort of a tagline of this series, which has been adopted
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   from smarter revivalists than myself.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.300]   I would not even dub myself as such. What we believe is that
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.000]   widespread revival begins with inner renewal. And we're seeing
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.800]   it. Like this is happening, not just in our nation, it's
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.300]   happening all around the globe.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.800]   You can look back at past weeks and see all the statistics
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.600]   that we've rolled up.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   But what we understand is there is a genuine surge of
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.700]   spirituality where God is doing something significant in
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.200]   the lives of people just like yourself.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   But what's fascinating about it is he's not just calling people
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.100]   back to the faith and reigniting their love for Jesus.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.800]   No, it actually goes further than just that. Because what
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.500]   we're seeing is individually people are returning to the
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.700]   church. They're committing to study the scriptures.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.800]   They're getting baptized, which may not feel important to
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.300]   you, but it's very important because what it does is it
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.900]   articulates the idea that inner renewal leads to revival.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   Because what we're seeing is that people are being moved by
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   God and not in the public places through a massive event or
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.000]   some sort of emotional upheaval.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.400]   That's not where he's moving most. Where he's moving most
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.300]   is in the secret places, the places of your heart.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.900]   Now as I say that, I know you're like, well, Kylin, isn't
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.800]   this a massive event?
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.700]   Aren't we a part of a giant spectacle? Won't we likely
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.400]   experience some sort of emotional upheaval? You might,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.000]   but here's the thing that I want you to know. Though God
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.600]   might begin the process of renewal here, that process does
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.300]   not end here. It must go with you. It has to leave these
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.800]   doors and it must engage with you in the regular day-to-day
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.300]   rhythms of your life.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:33.500]   You see, God is moving in a way that we should want for.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.300]   And I've said this and I'm saying it to you again tonight.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.200]   Like I am unapologetic in my desire for more of God here
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.400]   at The Porch. God has done a good thing for the last 20
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.600]   years. And yet I believe that the best things are even still
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.300]   ahead of us. That every day with God can be better than
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.000]   the last day with God. I want him for myself.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I want him for you. I want him for this room.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.300]   I want him for our city.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.700]   I want him for our generation.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.400]   But the way you get more of God
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.700]   is you give more of yourself.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.500]   The way you get more of God is you give more of yourself.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.400]   That's the idea behind consecration. Like it's not just
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.800]   giving up aspects of your life. It is giving up the entirety
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.200]   of your life to God. I like the way that Adrian Rogers puts
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.800]   it. He says, "Consecration is not giving God anything.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.500]   It is taking your hands off of that which already belongs
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   to him." Which can feel really intimidating to consider.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.200]   Like that's a bold claim. And yet as we consider the claim
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   of consecration, Paul is going to walk us through a series
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.600]   of steps we can take so that way it becomes true in our
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.900]   life. So that way we can let go of some of the things in
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.700]   this life. That way we might grab hold of more of God for
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.900]   our lives. And the reason we're looking at his letter
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.100]   to Timothy is he is writing this as sort of his swan song.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.700]   You see, 2 Timothy is Paul's last letter ever written.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.000]   He's sort of on his deathbed and he is pinning this moment
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.800]   to his protege and he's wanting to communicate to him a
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.700]   variety of important things. But dead center of the letter
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.700]   is this call to consecration. He's looking at Timothy
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.700]   and he's saying, "Hey, you, a young adult, someone in
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.400]   your mid to late 30s that's running a really big organization
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.800]   and facing a lot of people problems within your midst."
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.000]   Sound like anybody you know? There are a few things you
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.700]   need to focus on. They'll ultimately lead you from the
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.400]   life you have to the kind of life that God wants. And so
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.300]   he leads off and he says, 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 20,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.500]   "Now in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.500]   and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honorable
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.100]   use, but some for dishonorable." You see, Paul tells him
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.000]   that in God's house, there are two different types of
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.500]   vessels. There are honorable vessels and there are
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.000]   dishonorable vessels. What does he mean by that? Well,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.500]   it's interesting. There's not a clear consensus when
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.100]   it comes to the interpretation of what Paul specifically
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.300]   means. There's a wide debate, but most scholars land
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.800]   in one of two places whenever it comes to this subject.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.500]   They either believe that Paul is speaking about true
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.700]   and false believers, that in the church, not only in
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.300]   Ephesus, but in rooms like our own or in the church
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   that you attend, there are going to be people that
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.100]   ardently follow after Jesus and there are going to be
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.000]   people that do not follow after Jesus at all. That's
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.400]   one interpretation. The other interpretation is that
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.500]   Paul is speaking about two different statuses of
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.700]   believer. Don't think varsity versus JV, that there's
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.400]   one group of believer that's better than another.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   That's not what he's saying. What you should instead
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.700]   think is that there's one group of believers that
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.400]   are more committed than the other. It's like full-time
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   employees versus part-time employees. Whatever your
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.700]   interpretation is, the result is still the same. Paul
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.600]   is telling us that the goal of your life is to be a
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.400]   vessel of honorable use. Why is that? Because the
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.600]   kind of vessel you are directly correlates with the
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.900]   kind of purpose you have. The kind of vessel you are
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.600]   directly correlates with the kind of purpose you
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.700]   have. So in my house, the most honorable vessel that
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.200]   we own is the fine china from our wedding. You know,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.900]   that thing that people spend an exorbitant amount
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.400]   of money on that you never actually seem to use.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.500]   That's the finest piece of dishware we have. It's
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.700]   the most honorable vessel we use, and we only use
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.300]   it for our most distinguished house guests. And so
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.200]   honorable is this vessel that we never put it in
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.300]   the dishwasher. No, no, no. How dare we consider
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.400]   such a thing? We always hand wash every single
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.800]   plate. We hand dry every single plate. And if it
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.400]   doesn't go back in the cabinet, it probably goes
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   back in the box. Like this is the most honorable
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.200]   vessel we have. If you were to walk in my home and
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.700]   I chose instead to serve you with paper plates,
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.200]   that would communicate something different about
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.400]   the level of importance in our evening. What it
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.700]   would say is that this vessel is not nearly as
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.800]   honorable as the last. Therefore, this moment must
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.400]   not be as honorable as the last. You see, the kind
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.100]   of vessel correlates to the kind of purpose. Now,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.000]   could I use paper plates for our most distinguished
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.600]   dinners? Yes, I can, but I don't want to. That's
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.300]   what Paul's getting at. You see, Paul is articulating
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.600]   our first point that although God can use any
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.700]   kind of person, he wants to use a consecrated
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.700]   kind of person. Although God can use any kind of
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   person, he wants to use a consecrated kind of
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.100]   person. Like it's true. He can use anybody he
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.200]   wants, and he does it all throughout his scriptures.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.600]   He uses the prostitute Rahab. He chooses a
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.300]   rebellious prophet in Jonah. He grabs a real
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.800]   like a real swindler in Jacob, and he moves and
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.600]   he grabs a murderous religious man in Saul, and
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.400]   he uses them all for his purposes. He can use
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.800]   anybody he wants, but God wants to use people
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.000]   that want to be used by him. God wants to be used.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.500]   He wants to use people that want to be used by
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.900]   him. That's what 2 Chronicles 16 9 says. It says,
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.700]   "For the eyes of the Lord they run to and fro
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.000]   throughout the whole earth to give strong support
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   to those whose heart is blameless toward him."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.400]   That verse is certainly written at a very specific
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.600]   moment in Israel's history, and yet the principle
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.800]   still remains true today. God is searching for a
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.600]   people that he can give strong support to. What
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.900]   is the criteria for that people? The criteria
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.600]   for that people is not impressiveness. It's
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.700]   blamelessness, which is encouraging to me. Like
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.000]   we live in a culture of mega church pastors and
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.300]   Christian influencers, and yet what we're encouraged
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.800]   by is that our spiritual inferiority by way of
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.600]   we don't look as cool, or we don't sound as cool,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   or we're not quite as articulate as they are, or
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.200]   we're not as greatly gifted as they are. All of
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   that inferiority is pushed aside and done away
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.500]   with because God is not worried about anointing
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.600]   the particularly gifted. He uses them for sure,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   but he is particularly specific about anointing
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.100]   the blameless. That's what he cares about. He
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.800]   wants to use blameless people. What does that
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.400]   even mean? Blamelessness is the avoidance
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.600]   of the appearance of evil. That's what it is,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.500]   which can feel like an impossible target to hit.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.600]   Kylan, I'm not blameless. Like even when I do
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.500]   my best, like even when I wake up in the morning
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.100]   and I have the best of intent for my day, I still
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.900]   stumble and fall. I do things I know that I'm
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:59.200]   not supposed to do. God knows that. God isn't
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   looking at you and saying, "Hey, I'm looking for
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.700]   a perfect people." No, he is looking for a
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.100]   blameless people, a people that persist in their
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.600]   desire for spiritual improvement. That's what
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.400]   he wants, a people that are avoiding even the
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.400]   appearance of evil. That's why he says we must
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.300]   cleanse ourselves in verse 21. He says, "Therefore
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.000]   if anyone cleanses himself from what is
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.300]   dishonorable, he will be a vessel of honorable
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.700]   use." Anybody in here ever mistakenly loaded a
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.300]   clean dishwasher full of dirty dishes? Like you
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.400]   decided, "I think this is all dirty." And so you
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.300]   grab a bunch of dirty dishes from the sink and
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.600]   you put them in only to learn, "No, that was
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.100]   clean." Has that ever happened to you? That has
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.900]   happened to me. What do you do in that moment?
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.300]   You don't carefully inspect every single item.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.200]   Look at all the utensils to see which ones are
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.900]   dirty. You don't do that. Why? Because the danger
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.200]   of putting that dishonorable fork in your mouth
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.900]   is one that you cannot bear. And so you rerun
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.500]   the whole load. It's not worth the risk. That's
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.300]   what we must do whenever it comes to our personal
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.700]   contamination. We must likewise cleanse ourselves
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.600]   in so fervent a way. So how do we do that? Well,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.700]   Paul talks to us about a couple of different
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.900]   things we can do over the course of his letters.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.800]   I'm going to try to synthesize here in this
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.300]   moment. We talked about this a lot last week.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.100]   And so you can go reference the sermon from
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.100]   just a week ago. But here right now, I want to
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.000]   tell you four things you can do to help you
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.700]   cleanse yourself. Here's what they are. You need
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.600]   to assess the who, the what, the when, and the
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.000]   where of your defilement. We'll go through them
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   one by one. You need to assess the who. Like we
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.700]   need to consider what kind of contaminating
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.100]   company are we keeping? Who is it that we're
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.200]   spending time around, that we're frequenting
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.400]   the presence of, that does not actually uplift
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.800]   our souls but drags us into unnecessary sin?
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.100]   Where are we making rationalizations for the
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.600]   relationships in our life? Because well, they're
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.300]   my friends or that's my community group. When
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.800]   in reality, all it's doing is desensitizing
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.900]   you to the things that God cares about. Where
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.000]   is that happening in your story? Let me just
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   say, this does not mean that we should
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.700]   distance ourselves from sinners. No, we draw
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.200]   near to sinners. We ourselves are sinners, but
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.000]   those that don't know God, we come close to
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.400]   them too. Jesus loved being around sinners. He
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.300]   broke bread with them. He set a table with
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.900]   them. And yet here's what you need to know.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.100]   Every time he did, his motivation was not
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.700]   pleasure. It was purpose. He had a purpose in
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.800]   being around contaminating company. What's
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.300]   interesting is as you read Paul's letters, you
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.900]   realize he's actually not quite as concerned
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.700]   about your relationships with the defiled in
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.800]   the world. He's more concerned about your
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   relationships with the defiled in the church.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   That's where he's more concerned. It says in
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.000]   1 Corinthians 5, "I wrote to you in my letter
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.200]   not to associate with the sexually immoral
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   people." Catch this. Not at all meaning the
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.700]   people of this world who are immoral or greedy
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.700]   and swindlers, idolaters. In that case, you
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.900]   would have to leave this world. But now I'm
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.700]   writing to you that you must not associate
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.100]   with anyone who claims to be a brother or
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.300]   sister. That would be a believer that is
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.100]   sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.400]   slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Don't even
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.900]   eat with such people. That feels like a strong
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:51.200]   statement. And yet it does not diminish the
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.500]   truth. So where in your life are you
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   rationalizing relationships with other
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.100]   Christians? Because, man, they're your friends,
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.400]   they're your community, they're your lifelong,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.500]   your besties. And yet it is toxic to your soul.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.900]   It could be that group of friends that, man,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   they never go out and get drunk. That would
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.400]   ruin our witness. And yet they don't have a
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.600]   problem getting together in the safety of
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.700]   their home and having a few one too many. It
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.900]   could be that buddy of yours that, man, he
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.300]   loves to praise God and yet from the same
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.700]   mouth, he speaks profanity and makes vulgar
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.900]   jokes at the expense of other people. It could
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.000]   be that you have a group of friends that,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.800]   man, they love to get together and they know,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.600]   man, hey, the church is a unity of diversity
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   that we're not supposed to look all the same.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   And yet it would really mess up the social
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.100]   dynamic if we invited that person. You see,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.900]   these are the types of relationships that we
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.100]   need to investigate because they contaminate.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.300]   That's what Paul is telling you. You have to
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.600]   assess the who. Who is it that is potentially
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.300]   defiling you? If you want to get more of God,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.300]   then you might have to give them up. We'll go
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.600]   quick. The what of your defilement is we need
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.400]   to consider what activity in our lives is
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.900]   making us unclean. You see, this does not just
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   amount to sex, drugs, and drunkenness. It
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.900]   actually goes so much further. Like we need
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.200]   to consider what it is we consume. Like how
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.400]   good is it for your heart to watch the
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   Secret Lives of Mormon Wives? How good is
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   it for your soul to read A Court of Thorn
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.500]   and Roses every night before you go to sleep?
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   What's it doing to your spirit to listen to
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.000]   people like Tate McRae and Chapel Rowan?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.200]   This may feel very extreme. Look at me. This
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.800]   might feel extreme. Consecration is extreme.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.400]   If you're content settling for a life that is
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.000]   less than the one Christ has come to give
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.900]   you, have your way. And yet if you want more,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.700]   if you want to seize the kind of life that is
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.700]   available to you, then all of these things are
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.500]   worthy of giving away. That's the what. The
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   third is the when. We need to know when we're
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.700]   defiling ourselves. And this one's really
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.900]   important because most of your sin, it works
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.900]   like clockwork. Like if you consider the things
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.700]   you do in your life that you regret at the end
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.700]   of the day, they typically pop up at very
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.200]   rhythmic times. It happens every evening after
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.100]   11 p.m. when you should already be asleep.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's every Saturday whenever you're at the
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.900]   pool with your friends. It occurs at the end
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.600]   of every month whenever reports are due and
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.500]   you're stressed out of your mind. It's happy
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.000]   hour on Mondays after a long work day.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.900]   Romans 13 says, verses 13 through 14, "Let us
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.200]   walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.600]   and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.900]   sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.800]   Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.200]   provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.700]   You see, some of the best things we could
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.900]   do tonight is we could cleanse our calendars.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.600]   We consider where is it that I'm being led
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.800]   astray in my defilement that I can actually
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.400]   take time back for. And then the last is the
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   where, the where of your defilement. We need
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.900]   to take inventory of where we go that we always
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.700]   leave with more regret than when we arrived.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.800]   Like is it the gym? Is it brunch every weekend
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.900]   with the girls, with the guys? Is it being
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.600]   over at your girlfriend's house with the lights
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.000]   down low and the door shut behind? Maybe it's
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.400]   every time you go home to see your family, you
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.700]   revert right back into the same patterns that
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.700]   you've worked so hard to get away from. Where
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.900]   are you so very frequently defiled? I don't
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.300]   know where it is, but here's what I would say,
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.200]   and this is strong, you should stop going. And
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.100]   as I say that, here's what I know, like excuses
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.300]   just start popping off. But Kylan, like a guy's
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.900]   got to work out. Or you think that I can't help
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.800]   the fact that work sends me on a trip. You know
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.700]   what? I don't want to do what I do in that hotel
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.400]   room, but it's my job, man. Or maybe you think
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.300]   like, no, no, no, like that interview league,
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.400]   like I have to be there. I'm the best on the team.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.100]   If I'm not there, then they're never going to
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.500]   win. I don't know what it is. But rather than
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.400]   reaching for so many excuses, what if you reach
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.800]   for solutions instead? What if you actually
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.200]   considered what do I need to do so that way I
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.300]   do not do what I need to do? That makes sense?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.800]   You've got to let go of that which is gripped
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.000]   so very, so very fast of you. The sin which so
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.400]   easily entangles you have to get rid of it so
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.900]   that we can get as much of God as possible. This
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.200]   is the way of consecration. God wants to use
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:21.500]   you as you should be, not just as you are. That's
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.100]   the first step. The second step is in verse 21
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.700]   as well. It says, "Therefore, if anyone cleanses
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.300]   himself from what is dishonorable, he will be
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.900]   a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.000]   useful to the master of the house, ready for
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.800]   every good work." So based on what Paul is
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.700]   saying here, this is really important. He's not
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.800]   just saying that there are honorable vessels.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.000]   He's also saying there are honorable uses, which
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.700]   tells us something important. Consecration is
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.700]   uncomfortable, but it's always purposeful.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.000]   Consecration is uncomfortable, but it is always
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   purposeful. According to Paul, the goal isn't
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.200]   just to become an honorable vessel, but to fulfill
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.800]   an honorable use. I don't know what that does
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   for you, but that exhilarates me. That gets me
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.700]   excited because I don't just want to be someone
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.100]   that is polished up. I want to be someone that
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.300]   is purposed for. I want to have a purpose in my
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.600]   life, driven to do something that is great,
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.200]   that's worthy, that makes an impact. Listen to
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   me. God is the one that gives those things. There
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.500]   is no cause like the cause of Christ. There is
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.700]   no kingdom worth building than his kingdom
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.500]   itself. And so if you're looking for a purpose
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.400]   to live into, God has not just come to polish
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.900]   you. He has come to purpose you. And it's a
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.700]   purpose the likes of which you could not dare
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   dream find anywhere else. So several years ago,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.300]   I was visiting with a lady in our church. She
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.000]   was telling me about her son who was serving
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.100]   in the special forces. He had just come home,
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.700]   spent a little time with her, and he was
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   returning back to active duty, into deployment.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.300]   And she was telling me about everything he
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.300]   did. It included things the likes of which many
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.000]   men would wish were true in their own lives.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.400]   He was jumping from planes, and he was shooting
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.800]   targets 2,000 yards off, and he was engaging in
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.600]   guerrilla warfare. He was learning how to
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.900]   stabilize disrupted regions. And as she was
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:17.500]   telling me all of this, I had to ask her, "Does
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.900]   that not make you afraid when you consider all
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.400]   the danger he faces?" And I'll never forget her
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.700]   response. She looked at me and said, "God made
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.300]   my son to be a warrior. And so somehow, because
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.200]   that is his purpose, he is safer on the front
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.100]   lines of some foreign fight than he would ever
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.800]   be sitting on my couch at home." She knew
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   something important. The safest place for you
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.700]   is within your purpose. That's what Paul is
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.800]   trying to tell us here. God's purpose is not
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   just to cleanse you, but it's to use you.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.100]   Now, he wants to use you, not just in the small
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.200]   ways you expect, but likely in the big ways
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.700]   you might forget. Like, I don't know about you,
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.000]   but more than likely, God wants to use your
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.500]   life by way of your hand to bring the least
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.300]   likely into saving faith. Like, he wants to
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.100]   empower your voice to be the one that speaks
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.800]   gospel identity and security into those family
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.200]   members that you have been praying for for so
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.500]   long. Don't you want God to use you to be the
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.900]   one to bring his manifest presence into your
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.200]   workspace or around your house or amongst your
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.400]   neighbors because you just pray ardently that
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.700]   he would show up? Don't you want God to lean
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.400]   into your life and give more power to you, not
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.700]   for your own glorification, not for your own
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.100]   reputation, but so that way he can get glory,
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.200]   they can get good, and you can get gladness.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.000]   Don't you want that? Listen, that is what God
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.900]   wants. He wants to give you greatly, not for
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.200]   you in and of yourself, but for himself and
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.700]   for others as well. That's the heart of God.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.600]   He wants to use you for a great purpose. You
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   see, consecration is not just about purging
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.800]   yourself of impurity, it's about preparing
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.900]   yourself for destiny. So how do you do that?
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.600]   Well, Paul gives you a threefold way. He says
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.900]   you must set yourself apart as holy, you become
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.600]   useful to the master, and you are ready for
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.500]   every good work. You're set apart as holy. The
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.900]   word here in Greek is the same word used to
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.300]   be sanctified. The idea of sanctification is
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   it's the lifelong process of becoming like
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.400]   Jesus. You see, consecration is not just about
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   setting aside your sin and looking less like
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.900]   the world, it's about setting apart yourself
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.000]   and looking more like Christ. Do you see it?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.200]   Consecration is the other side of repentance.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.500]   They are one in the same, on the same coin,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.800]   and yet repentance says, "Hey, turn away from
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.700]   these things," and consecration says, "Turn
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.700]   towards these things. Set yourself apart, move
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.000]   yourself towards greater holiness, become like
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.700]   Christ." I love the quote of C.S. Lewis on this
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.600]   idea. He says, "The more we let God take us over,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.000]   the more truly ourselves we become, because he
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.300]   made us, he invented us, he invented all the
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.400]   different people that you and I were intended
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.200]   to be. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.500]   up myself to his personality, that I first
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.800]   begin to have a real personality of my own."
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.300]   You see, whatever you set yourself apart to
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.700]   will determine what you become. So let me ask
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   you, what are you setting yourself apart to?
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.200]   What are you setting yourself apart to? It's
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.800]   interesting. Consecration to God is so very hard
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.500]   for most of us, and yet we all consecrate
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.600]   ourselves to something every single day. Some
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.000]   of you have consecrated yourself so devotedly
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.700]   to your job, to the point that you're working
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.400]   70, 80, 90-hour weeks. Why? Because you want
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.600]   to become partner, because you want to make
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   seven figures a year, because you want to be
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.100]   on Forbes 30 Under 30. So many of you have
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   consecrated yourself to perfection, to the
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.100]   point that you clear your inbox every single
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.400]   day, and we hate you for it. You mark off every
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   single thing on your to-do list, unlike most
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   of us. You type, and you retype, and you retype
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.000]   that caption again and again and again, because
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.600]   you can't get it perfect enough. Why do you
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.700]   do that? Because you do not want to become a
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.000]   failure. You want to become approvable. So many
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.400]   of us are consecrated with our bodies, to the
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.700]   point that you count up a calorie, you never
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.800]   miss a class, how dare you think about missing
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.300]   your anabolic window, you get some work done.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.600]   Why? Because you have a vision of what you
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.900]   want to look like, who you physically want to
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.900]   become. You are consecrating yourself to
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.300]   something, and that something is determining
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:12.000]   what you are becoming. If you're setting yourself
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.900]   apart to anything other than Christ, you are
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.500]   settling for less. You are settling for less.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.200]   The more of God you give, the more of God you
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:28.100]   get, and there's nothing like God. You become
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.800]   useful to the master of the house. That's the
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.700]   second thing he says. What does it mean to be
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.500]   useful? It does not mean just to be available.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.700]   It means to be helpful. I am not useful to my
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.300]   wife if I'm standing in the kitchen waiting for
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.100]   her to call me over. I'm just a waste of space.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.900]   I am helpful to my wife whenever I start scrubbing
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.200]   dishes and cooking dinner and putting away
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.700]   groceries. That's when I become useful. Listen
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   to me. So many of us were available for the work
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.300]   of God, but we're not helpful to the work of
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.200]   God. We're actually fully present, hoping he
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.600]   calls, and we're missing the fact that he's
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.900]   already called. I love this, man. Adam, Adam and
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:16.700]   Eve, that brother was waiting for a suitable
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.300]   partner, and yet he didn't just sit around
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.500]   available to the work of God. He was helpful to
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.600]   it. He named every single animal in the animal
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.200]   kingdom. That guy was working. He was helpful
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.700]   to the things of God. And in due time, God gave
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.400]   that brother what he wanted and what so many of
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.600]   you want as well. Why don't you move towards
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.100]   being helpful? For in your helpfulness, God will
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.900]   use you to be useful also. Friends, listen to
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.000]   me. Here's how you can tell if you're being
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.300]   useful. If you left the church tomorrow, would
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   we feel your absence? Would we actually know?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.100]   I remember facing this question several years
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:05.500]   ago and realizing the answer was no. I wasn't
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.000]   serving. I wasn't plugged in. I wasn't leading
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.900]   in any kind of capacity. I was just attending.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   I was just consuming. And had I left that day,
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:22.600]   no one would have known the wiser. Friends, this
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:30.500]   is important. No Christian is better than another.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.700]   But some Christians are more useful than others.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.500]   Some are more useful. Why don't you be useful?
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.400]   Get involved. Serve someplace. Get your membership
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   in process. Join the church. Like choose to plug
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.300]   into what God is doing here. Start being helpful
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.400]   because that's what makes you useful for God.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.100]   The third thing that he says is he says be ready
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.000]   for every work. The Greek here literally means
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.900]   to make ready. Not just that you're willing, but
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.700]   you're already made ready. Like the idea of this
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.400]   is what we studied about the Revolutionary War
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.500]   whenever we in grade school from the Minutemen.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.500]   You remember those guys like that small group,
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.600]   the elite fighting force that they would pop up
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.700]   and spring in action at a moment's notice. That's
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.600]   what it means to be ready to work. It's to be a
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.300]   Minuteman to the glory of God and the good of
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.200]   Christ. Like that's what you're called to do.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.800]   And every time this word for make ready or to
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.100]   prepare is using the scripture, it's always used
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.900]   or frequently used in advance of something big.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.500]   Like just to give you a rundown. Like prepare
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.200]   the way of the Lord. Prepare the Passover meal.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.000]   Jesus' burial was prepared. He was prepared before
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.300]   his burial. You prepared a place for the Ark of
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.500]   the Covenant to reside. The left and right hand
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.600]   seats beside Jesus in glory must be prepared by
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.700]   the Father. New Jerusalem was prepared. The city
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.800]   of God by God himself. The promised land was
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.300]   one which was prepared for the people to inherit.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   The bride of Christ is prepared, adorned for her
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.100]   husband. God prepares all throughout the scripture
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.800]   for really great things and he is prepared for
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   you as well. Ephesians 2 10 says, "For we are
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.700]   his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.600]   works, which God," what? "prepared beforehand that
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.800]   you should walk in them." God has already prepared.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.000]   The question is, are you preparing yourself?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Like do you have to be coaxed or urged or persuaded
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.800]   into action? Or are you ready for it? Like when
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.600]   you sit down with your boss and they talk start
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.200]   talking spiritual things, are you ready to share
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.000]   the gospel with them? Oh, no, Colin. That would
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.700]   be too much. Listen, that's what consecration
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.300]   looks like. It's saying I'm willing not just to
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.800]   do what's acceptable. I'm willing to do whatever
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.600]   it takes to give God a glory and lean into his
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.700]   purposes for my life. It is there where I feel
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.500]   totally out of control that I might actually see
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   God moving away the likes of which I normally
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:08.000]   do not. Some of you, you need to consider if,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.700]   man, am I ready to give up that paycheck to pay
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.000]   someone's rent because they can't make it this
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   month? I don't know what it is. Consider the
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.900]   craziest thing in your mind. And the question
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.600]   is, are you prepared to do that? Are you prepared
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.100]   to do it? Because God wants to make you ready
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:32.800]   for every good work. Our third and final step.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.100]   It's in verse 22. We'll go quick. He says, "So
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.800]   flee youthful passions, pursue righteousness,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.300]   faith, love, and peace, along with those who
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:46.000]   call on the Lord from a pure heart." Paul reiterates
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.400]   here what he's been saying this entire time. He
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.000]   says, "Hey, there are some things that you need
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.700]   to set aside in your sin. There is some ways that
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.300]   you need to set yourself apart to God." And here
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.800]   in this moment, he tells you the heart behind
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.000]   it all. It's because you just want more of God.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.200]   That's it. That's the heart that he's communicating
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.900]   here. You do all of these things. You do what
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.200]   feels so extreme, so even unnecessary, because
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.300]   you just want more of God. And listen to me.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:20.300]   That is what God wants to. God is looking for
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.500]   a people that are looking for him. God is looking
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.100]   for a people that are looking for him. Are you
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.100]   looking for him? Yeah, man. I show up at church
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.800]   on Sunday. Yeah, man. I come to a group once a
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.300]   week. Go around, confess my sin. Yeah, man. I
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.100]   pay my monthly Christian membership fees. I
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.900]   make sure I get my quiet time in at least a
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.500]   couple times a week. That's not looking for him.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:52.000]   Looking for God is one that's not trying to
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.300]   balance spiritual burnout, but is willing to
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.200]   burn for God instead. Willing to lean all the
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.800]   way forward into what he wants to give you,
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   which is life, the likes of which you will find
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.700]   nowhere else. What's the cost? Everything. It
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.500]   costs you everything. You take up your cross,
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.800]   you die to yourself, and yet what do you find
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.300]   in return? Everything. You find Jesus, the one
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.500]   who leads you not just into life today, but
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.000]   life forever. He gives you what no one else can.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.700]   And not only does he give you everything that
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.400]   you want, he is incomparable next to any other
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.500]   alternative. He is matchless in his beauty. He
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   is transcendent beyond comprehension. There's
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.600]   no one like him. And so yes, we can say you're
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.800]   everything, Jesus, but your heart, if you were
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.900]   to see him more clearly, would say, I want you
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.500]   to be everything too. Are you looking for him?
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.800]   You see, consecration is a work that begins at
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   an individual level, but imagine what God would
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.000]   do if hundreds of us were filled with this
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.600]   holy ambition to uncommonly devote ourselves
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.200]   to him. What would he do? What do you think
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.100]   God would do? I genuinely believe he would move
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.800]   in this room in ways we've never seen. He would
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.200]   move in our city in ways we've never seen. He
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.500]   would move in our generation in ways we've
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.400]   never seen. Not so people look back and say,
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.700]   man, it started in Dallas. No, so people know
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.700]   it started with him. That would be the result.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.500]   God gives more of himself wherever we give
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:36.200]   more of ourselves. And the reason we know that
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.100]   that nothing should be off limits, that nothing
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.900]   is out of bounds, that nothing is ever too much
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.900]   is because Jesus looked at you and said, nothing
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.200]   is off limits. Nothing is too much. Nothing is
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.600]   out of bounds. I will go as far as I can to get
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.800]   to them. You know, when I started building that
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.500]   patio cover, all the thoughts of what would be
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.100]   hosting friends over and watching football and
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.400]   pushing my son in his swing, all of those things
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.900]   were deeply motivating for me. They were a good
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.200]   reason to absorb the considerable cost in order
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.700]   to pursue a considerable purpose. But those things
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:16.100]   are not the only reason why I still do it today.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.000]   In fact, they might not be the biggest reason
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.600]   why I do it today. No, the biggest reason why I
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.300]   continue to pour myself out at great cost to
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:28.500]   myself to build the structure is because my dad
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.900]   is helping me build it. You see, when my father
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.300]   caught wind of what I was doing, how much it was
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.500]   costing, how hard I was working, he jumped into
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:46.800]   it with me. Yes, I was giving so much, but by the
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.100]   way, the time we get together, I have gotten far
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.600]   more in return. That's the promise of consecration.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.300]   That as you pour out, God pours in. He pours in
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.300]   in a way that exceeds whatever it is you give.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   He wants to give more of himself to you. And the
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.300]   reason we know that is because he gave everything
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:15.600]   for you. We know when there was no one capable
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.100]   of living the perfect life, Jesus wanted to live
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.500]   the perfect life in your place. He did everything
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.700]   that you could not, so that he could have everything
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.300]   he wants to give. But not just that, he endured
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.800]   all of the discomfort of your sin because he was
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   driven by a purpose the likes of which heaven
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.500]   rejoices in. One where sinners come home, the lost
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:48.000]   are found, the dead are saved. And when none of
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.600]   us were looking for him, he came looking for you.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.700]   Looking for you, not just in life, not just in
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.700]   death, but looking for you in resurrection that
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.400]   he might give the resurrected life to any that
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.700]   would place their faith in him. When we were not
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.400]   pursuing him, he was pursuing you. When we were
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.800]   not willing to sacrifice for his sake, he was
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.200]   willing to sacrifice for yours. When we were not
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.100]   willing to devote all of our lives, he was willing
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.800]   to devote all of his love. Why? So that he might
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.400]   have you forever. Porch, let me ask you, do you
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.000]   want to be consecrated? You give more of God if
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.800]   you do. Is it uncomfortable? For sure. Is it
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.500]   worthwhile? Absolutely. Let me pray for you. God,
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   thanks for tonight. Thanks for my friends here
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.100]   and their patience just as we work through this
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:48.400]   this evening. God, I know this topic is hard and
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.500]   it's heavy. I felt that God, even as I was prepping
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.200]   it, it's one that it can feel like, man, you're
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.000]   asking a lot of me, but really God, what we need
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.700]   believe is you are offering so much to us instead.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.900]   The exchange right here is crazy. It's one where
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.200]   we give up not just the bad, but also some good.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.300]   Why? So we can get God. And so Lord, I pray you
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.800]   would help us to understand you are not asking
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.300]   too much. Instead, you're giving too much. You're
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.400]   giving too much to an unworthy people. You're
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   giving yourself for you have already given
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.900]   yourself in your son. I pray Lord, if there are
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.900]   any here that do not know you, they might know
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.500]   you tonight. They might see you, Jesus, place
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.300]   their faith in you as Lord and follow you forever.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:44.800]   It's that easy. And for others, God, I pray, work
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.200]   your now Holy Spirit. Do the work of illumination,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   bring things to mind, the work of conviction,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.900]   prick our hearts, but ultimately the work of
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   transformation where you lead us not just to be
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.500]   better, but to be more like you. We love you.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.300]   It's in your name we pray. Amen.
