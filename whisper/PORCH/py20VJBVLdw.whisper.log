[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good evening and welcome to the porch.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.920]   relationships.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.560]   Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.200]   we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.320]   So how do we relate? To answer this we'll look to scripture and find exactly what
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.600]   God has to say about our relationships.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.360]   This is, after all, the Relationship Series.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.680]   Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight? Great to see you.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.200]   Glad to have you here with us in Dallas, Texas, but also glad to have all of our
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.680]   Porch Live locations tuning in
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.880]   from around the nation. Special shout out to Porch Live Tulsa,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.680]   Fresno, and for the very first time, Porch Live Springfield.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   Let's go Porch Live! Love it! Anybody from the Midwest in the room?
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920]   We love the Midwest. Hey, well there's one movie
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.320]   where the top A-list celebrities of the 1990s all assembled together
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   to form what is arguably one of the greatest cast lists
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.320]   of all time. It included an acting
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.120]   ensemble with household names like Val Kilmer
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.760]   and Ralph Fiennes, who you know as Voldemort, or Sandra Bullock,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.040]   Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Sir Patrick Stewart,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.120]   Michelle Pfeiffer. But not just that, it had an amazing
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.080]   acting ensemble, but it also had award-winning musical composition by the
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.720]   one
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.280]   and only Hans Zimmer. But not just that,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.040]   it also boasted a title track sung by
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.080]   not one, but two powerhouses,
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.960]   Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. You see, there was good reason why the world was
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.400]   eagerly waiting and watch, anticipating the day when this movie would launch,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.040]   which it eventually did in 1998. What movie
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.440]   am I talking to you about? An animated
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.560]   Bible story known as The Prince of Egypt.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.440]   If you've never seen the movie, then take the reference from your peers. It's well
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.960]   worth
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.160]   the watch. You see, The Prince of Egypt is a retelling of one of the most iconic stories in all
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.640]   of human history. It's the story of a guy by the name of Moses
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.000]   who goes to Egypt to free God's people, the nation of Israel
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120]   or the Hebrew people. And like any good
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   Hollywood historical adaptation, there's a little creative license. But what you find
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.960]   as you watch the movie is they really do a good job honoring the
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   essence of the entire story. And
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.760]   they depict some very specific scenes that are just
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.720]   amazing to watch, that bring the story to life in a way
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280]   that has touched me for a very long time. It's my favorite animated movie.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.800]   And so rather than tell you a little bit about it, I thought I would show you one of those
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.520]   scenes in specific. So take a watch as Moses engages the burning bush.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   Now there are a lot of Moses movies
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.560]   out there and plenty of burning bush scenes you could watch. But the reason we wanted to pick
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.360]   this one specifically for you is I think it
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.840]   shows Moses wrestling with his sense of self
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   better than any other film. And the reason that's important for us
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.760]   is because that's exactly what we're talking about tonight. You see, all series long as we've
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   been making our way through the relationship series, we've been talking about
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.960]   what is God's design for relating to others. But tonight,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.240]   as we bring the relationship series to a close,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.480]   we want to talk to you about what God's design is
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.040]   as you relate to yourself. And so for us to do it,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.840]   we're gonna be in the book of Exodus, chapter 3.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   You can grab a Bible, you can turn there with me, and what you need to know is that
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.680]   we're gonna work through three different ways in which we relate to ourselves.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.480]   We're gonna talk about
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.560]   insignificance, insecurity, and inadequacy.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.880]   To catch you up on the story as we find ourselves
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.640]   in chapter 3 of Exodus, we see that the Hebrews are enslaved
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.040]   to Egypt. They're under Pharaoh, and Pharaoh has feared the expansive growth
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.440]   of this fledgling nation. He's
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.760]   grown so fearful that this nation is growing so quickly
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.360]   that he has enslaved the entire population. But not just that. In order to
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.720]   exercise even further population control,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   what he orders is the death of every firstborn
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.680]   son within a Hebrew family. He decrees genocide.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.080]   And yet, as God would have it,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.480]   we meet Moses,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.720]   who is a firstborn Hebrew son
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.640]   that is actually adopted into Pharaoh's household,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   raised by Pharaoh's own daughter,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   all for the purpose of eventually overthrowing Pharaoh
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   through the power of God himself.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.760]   And so what we find as we come to verse 1 is God's call to Moses to step
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.480]   into this grand purpose. And yet before he begins to unpack the purposes he has
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.360]   for Moses, he needs to write
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.120]   Moses' perspective of self. And so this is what it says in verse 1.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.800]   "Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.560]   the priest of Midian. And he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness, and he
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.480]   came to Horeb,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.640]   the mountain of God. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   the midst of a bush.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.800]   And he looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. So
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.160]   as a reasonable man, Moses said, 'I will turn aside to see this great sight. Why
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   the bush is not burned?'
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.960]   And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   God called to him out of the bush. Moses
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.440]   Moses. And he said, 'Here I am.'"
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   As we open the story, we see that God
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.200]   is moving towards Moses. And we see it in verse 1, that he moves towards Moses all the
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.760]   way
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840]   in the land of Midian. Midian, just for your perspective,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.120]   is 500 to 600 miles away from Egypt, meaning Moses has
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.640]   gone a long ways from where he grew up. He has journeyed out,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.800]   he has journeyed into the land of Midian, and he's at the Mount of Horeb.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.080]   Horeb, when you translate it directly from the Hebrew,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.200]   means barren or desolate. That's where God finds him.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.640]   And he's shepherding his father-in-law's flock, which means that Moses
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.920]   has no sheep to his own name. So to put this into perspective for you,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.680]   Moses has left the halls of Highland Park, and he has traveled into the wild
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.520]   and waste
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.360]   of West Texas, where he lives nowhere of significance,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.480]   with no one of significance, doing nothing of significance.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.360]   And yet it's out in the mundanity of Midian
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   that God meets with him. And some of you need to know that tonight.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.480]   Like, some of you need to know, like, in the
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.080]   in the sea of sand you see within your circumstances, and
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.960]   as barrenness abounds within your own life, where you feel like, "Man, I'm
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.160]   only in an insignificant place. I'm stuck where I am. I can't get
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.520]   out of this spot." God will come to you there.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.720]   You don't need to be within the halls of power
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.280]   or seated amongst the privilege for God to come to you,
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.080]   because God comes to Moses in an insignificant
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.040]   setting. And yet he doesn't just come to catch up with him.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.200]   Like, if you keep reading, we'll jump down to verse 9, it says, "And now behold, the cry of
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.800]   the people of Israel has come to me,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.080]   and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.720]   oppressed them. Come, I will send you to Pharaoh,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.440]   that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.840]   and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?'" You see, God moves towards Moses,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.240]   yes, but he also has a mission for Moses.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.400]   Namely, he wants to use Moses
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.680]   to liberate his people, to free his followers,
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.400]   to change the destinies of people for generations. He has a grand plan
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.600]   in store for the life of Moses. Like, this is a
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.520]   world-changing, life-altering invitation. How does Moses respond?
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.360]   "Yes! Finally! I've been waiting for this moment!"
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.880]   "No. I'm going to spring into action. I'm going to pack my bags, I'm going to load my camel, I'm going to start
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.680]   riding off
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.080]   to Egypt immediately. We're going to get there as soon as possible, God." "No.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.840]   Finally. It's about time you figured out that I was the guy."
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   "No, that's not God. That's not Moses' response. What is Moses'
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   response?" He gets nervous. Like, he starts pitting.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.520]   He starts sweating. He starts second-guessing
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.280]   that God's got the right guy. Like, he looks like that NFL draft that you don't
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.040]   want to pick.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.640]   He's the guy that's walking across stage, and you're like, "No, don't do it! Don't pick that guy!"
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.320]   Because he's the one that's walking up to the commissioner and shaking his hand and saying,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.720]   "Hey, are you sure about this thing? Like, did they actually pick me?
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.480]   You could have gone with someone better." What would that guy inspire
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.840]   in the mind's eyes of his fans? No confidence.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.400]   Like, the fans don't want to cheer his name. The fans don't want that guy at all.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   And yet, porch. That guy
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   is exactly who God wants. That's exactly
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.520]   who God wants. Like, just look at the way that God responds to him.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.200]   Verse 12, "And God said,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.880]   'But I'll be with you, and this shall be the sign for you
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.760]   that I've sent you. When you have brought the people of Egypt, or when you've brought the people
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.'
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.840]   Then Moses said to God, 'If I come to the people of Israel, and I say to them,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.120]   "The God of your fathers has sent me to you," and they ask, "Well, what's his name?
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.760]   What should I say to them?" And God said to Moses, "I am
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.880]   who I am." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.600]   I am has sent me to you." God also said to Moses,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.280]   "And say this to the people of Israel. The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.760]   Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, he has sent me to you. This is my name
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.760]   forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations."
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   Like, God doesn't respond to Moses by boosting his confidence,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.480]   by stroking his ego, by hyping him up. He doesn't even agree with the guy. Like, he
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.680]   doesn't come to Moses and go, "Yeah, man. You're definitely a work in progress. Let's get a
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.400]   personal improvement plan together and get you in a tip-top shape, because this
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.880]   is going to be a big job, and I don't know that you're ready for it." That's not God's
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.760]   approach to Moses whatsoever. What is God's approach to Moses? As Moses
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.120]   looks at him, he's like, "You got the wrong guy. Like, who am I?"
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:33.560]   God looks at him and says, "Who are you? Who am I? I am that I am."
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.600]   Like, you're asking the wrong question. Like,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.760]   I am the one that is going to be with you. Don't worry about yourself.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.840]   Worry about me. I'm the one that's coming with you on this grand journey,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.240]   because you see true significance. It's not found in who you are. It's found in
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.560]   who God is. True significance isn't found in who you
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.200]   are. It is found in who God is. Meaning, if you want a right view of
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.720]   yourself, then you need to get a right view of him.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.920]   That's how you get a good view of yourself. You get a good,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   long view of him. You need to know him as he is.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.040]   And the good news is, he gives us three descriptors for himself. He tells us
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.280]   exactly who he is. He gives us three things. What's he say?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:23.080]   He says, "I will be with you." Like, what's that mean? Like, no matter
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.200]   what in your life leaves you feeling insignificant, where you come from, the
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.000]   job you have, the past you carry, the shame you feel,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.680]   the sort of people you surround yourself with, the
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.000]   struggles that you endure, no matter what leaves you feeling insignificant, if God
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.640]   is with you, he is present in your life, then insignificance is not your story.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   Isaiah 41 10 tells us, "Fear not, for I'm with you. Be not dismayed. I am your God.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.920]   I will strengthen you. I will help you. I'll uphold you with my righteous right
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.360]   hand." Psalm 23, a famous psalm in verse 4 says,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.240]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   I will fear no evil." Why? "For you are with me.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.400]   Your rod, your staff, they comfort me." Zephaniah 3 17
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   it says, "The Lord your God is with you. The mighty warrior who saves," and look at
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.560]   what he does, "he will take great delight in you.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.640]   In his love, he will no longer rebuke you,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.360]   but he'll rejoice over you with singing." You see, the presence of
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.320]   one who is significant dignifies that which is insignificant.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.760]   I remember in 2015 reading an article about someone that made $60,000
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.640]   because they sold a bag of air on eBay from a Kanye West
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.120]   concert. $60,000 for a bag of air!
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.040]   Listen to me, porch. If the presence of Kanye West
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.960]   can take something as insignificant as a Ziploc baggie of air
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:08.360]   and auction it for 60k, how much more valuable do you think the
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.960]   presence of God in your life will make you
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.160]   infinitely, infinitely, infinitely more valuable?
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.360]   Because he's with you. The second thing he tells us is he tells us his name.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   He says, "I am who I am." Now listen, there's an entire sermon locked up in that
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.320]   statement. That's something for another time,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.560]   but just to give it to you very simply, what God is saying is God
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:40.760]   is saying, "I am." He is. He is not the God of just one thing.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   God of water, God of rivers, God of war, God of love, God of harvest. He is not the
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.560]   God of one thing. He is the God of everything.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.880]   Like, he is self-existent.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:03.480]   Like, before anything was, he is. He has always been. He will always be.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.240]   And he is self-sufficient. He needs no one
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:13.640]   or no thing. Like, hello, the bush was on fire yet not consumed.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.560]   He defies natural order because he is self-sufficient. He is self-sustaining,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   and he is self-directed. I mean, he didn't take orders from anybody.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.520]   He's the one in charge. He's the one who makes the calls. He's the one that
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.440]   determines where and when and what he does.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.280]   And yet, here's the thing. If God is eternally constant, totally
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.400]   independent, and supremely dominant, so transcendent
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.240]   above all other beings, yet he is with you,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.880]   then just think about it. Though God has always been,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.320]   he wants to be with you.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:58.360]   Though God needs no one or no thing, he wants to be with you. Though God
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.440]   does not take orders from anyone, he wants to be with you
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.200]   because that's who he is. He is God powerful, yet God present.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.400]   And thirdly, he's a God of promise because that's what he tells us. He gives
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.160]   us a promise. He says, "I'm the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   and Jacob." Why is he rolling that line out? Because he wants them to know, "Hey,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.640]   the word that I gave to your family in times past,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.800]   I will keep in times to come. I am the same God back then
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.160]   as I will be today, as I will be in the future. I'm not just a God that
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.360]   reigns over everything. I'm a God that relates to a specific people,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.800]   to my people, to those that call on my name and believe
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   in my son." Why does any of this matter? Because when you combine a God that's
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.680]   present with a God that's powerful, with a God of promise, what you get is a
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.960]   God so significant where everything he says
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.160]   about himself changes everything you see about yourself.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.560]   And friends, I don't know if you don't like what you see in the mirror,
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.880]   but if you don't, if you wake up and you take a hard look at yourself and you
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.520]   don't like what's staring back at you, then listen to
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.280]   me. It's time for you to stop telling yourself,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.960]   telling God about yourself, and time to start telling yourself about God.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.720]   That's the right step for you, and that step can begin tonight.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.200]   Now some of you, you're here and you're like, "Listen, I get that.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.640]   Insignificance is part of my story. Where I come from, I'm ashamed of it. The things
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.200]   that I've done, yeah, I wish I could take those
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.880]   back. My family, they're not the greatest of people, but it's not just
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.520]   insignificance that gets in the way, Kylin. I also, I've got some insecurities.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.640]   I've done some things. I've been some places. What do you have to say about
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.920]   that?" Well, thankfully, Moses can relate to you pretty
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.040]   well, and so we'll keep reading. We're actually going to jump down to chapter
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.000]   four, and we're going to read this in verse one.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.560]   "Then Moses answered God, 'But behold, they will not believe me or
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.200]   listen to my voice, for they will say, 'The Lord
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.640]   did not appear to you.'" Why is Moses so insecure as to think that
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.080]   the people of Israel won't listen to him, won't believe him
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.040]   when he shows up? I mean, God literally just said, "Hey, go
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.880]   and declare my name to them." When they ask, "This is who I am. I am
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.280]   that I am. Go and tell them that this is my name."
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.120]   And yet Moses, he has a rebuttal. "But God, what if they don't believe me?" Why is he
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.080]   so insecure to think that these people won't believe him?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:37.560]   Because he knows, and they know, what he did in the past.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.800]   He knows, and they know, that he already ruined his reputation,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.360]   and he fears there's no coming back from it. So what did he do?
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.000]   Well, we don't have time to read it, but if you go and you look at Exodus 2, you
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.480]   get a story about Moses in his younger years.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.040]   And what you see is a young man that has all this unbridled passion for the very
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.000]   thing that God's calling him to do. He wants to deliver
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.080]   his people, the Hebrew people, God's people, out of slavery. That's what he's
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.760]   burdened for. That's what he wants to do. And yet he tries to do it on his own
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.640]   strength. He tries to do it by his own power.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.840]   And so what he does is he springs into action. He sees an Egyptian
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.880]   who's attacking a Hebrew. He says, "That's not cool."
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.720]   Jumps in. He kills the Egyptian, which is probably taking it a little bit too far.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.240]   And then he buries the body in the sand, tries to hide the evidence.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.920]   And yet he does such a bad job at hiding the evidence that he actually gets
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.400]   exposed in front of everybody. Like everyone knows what what Moses did.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.160]   Everybody knows he's at the top of Egypt's most wanted list.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.240]   And not only that, rather than becoming the deliverer that his people desired,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.000]   he becomes a murderer that all of them despised.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.080]   He's ousted. He's rejected. No one wants anything to do with him. He is
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.280]   ostracized into the wilderness, into the land of Midian.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.520]   That's why this whole proposal from God feels so hard to stomach.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.240]   Doesn't make any sense. God, you can't send me back there.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.920]   They know what I did. Like I'm not just a nobody from nowhere. I
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.640]   actually used to be a somebody that blew it in front of everybody.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.360]   And so I can't go back. You've got the wrong guy.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.320]   It reminds me of a time in my life when I made the switch from corporate into
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.920]   ministry. Like I left the safety of the
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.120]   corporate work environment and I made my way into the instability
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.080]   of the ministry world. And yet I did so knowing, like man, I think that this thing
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.880]   could work. Like I believe, and I have some friends around
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.960]   me, community that have edified the fact that yeah, like you love the Bible and
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.080]   you've got some communication gifts. Yeah, they need to be worked out, but
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.360]   man, you've got some raw potential. Like get out there and go for it. And so
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.040]   I stepped into ministry and yet the thing that you need to know about teaching
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:56.440]   is the only way to assess fully how good you are at it is the hard launch.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   Like you just got to go for it. Okay, and so I finally got the chance to do that.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.120]   In 2017, I stood on stage with a speaking
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.440]   opportunity for the very first time in my life.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.560]   It was a crowd of several thousand people. It was awesome.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.680]   Meaningful moment for me. And I remember it like it was yesterday. Like the
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   evening came, the worship started, the people stood, the
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.040]   hands were raised, and worship came to a close, and the people
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.120]   applauded, and the drums washed out, and I felt my moment
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.240]   is here. At long last, this is it. This is my
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.840]   chance. This is what I've been preparing for.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.240]   Tonight marks the journey as I move my way into being a preacher of God's word.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.720]   And not just a preacher, but a powerful preacher
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.840]   of God's word. I'm gonna do this thing. Tonight is the night.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.480]   And so as the drums washed, I in slow motion rose from my seat
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.800]   and began to make my way to the stage. And as I ascended the steps, and I walked
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.840]   to the center, rather than share a few announcements and
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.640]   then transition this really smoothly back into worship, I, like a deer in
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.480]   headlights, froze.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:19.400]   What's my line? What am I supposed to say?
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.960]   You see, my moment had arrived, but I had not.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.720]   And rather than proving myself to be a speaker, the likes of which all people
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.560]   would want to listen to, all I'd proven is I didn't know how to speak at all.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.000]   Moses is in a really similar spot. He wanted to be a deliverer, but when the
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.840]   moment came, he blew his chance. He failed. He knows it. Everyone knows it.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.280]   And he just thinks that there's no coming back from it. That's why he's
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.160]   insecure. Like he didn't just make some
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.960]   questionable decisions that led to a bad reputation.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.400]   No, he made an irreversible decision that ruined his reputation.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.760]   Like he doesn't think that these people will believe God sent him because he
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   doesn't believe that he deserves to be sent.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.320]   And the reason for it is because he's so preoccupied with his past.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.080]   He's so stuck in the rear view that he can't move
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.680]   on. And the truth of the matter is, Porch, if we can be really honest with
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.840]   ourselves tonight, some of us are in that exact same place.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.000]   Some of you look back and you know the things you did. You know the
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.800]   choices you made. You know the people that you hurt. You know the secrets that
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.960]   you hid. You know the places that you went and the
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.920]   words that you spoke. You know all of it. And as you look back, you can't even
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   contemplate moving forward because of everything you've done.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.680]   All the history behind you merely haunts you.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.360]   And so rather than open yourselves to the opportunity that God may want to do
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.800]   something in you, what you do is you close yourself off from the possibility
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.920]   that God wants anything to do with you. You feel like Moses. You feel like a
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.960]   failure. You ruined your reputation. You wrecked
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.240]   your witness. You did that thing which cannot be undone.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:09.560]   And now no one will ever believe that God actually wants to use you.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:19.880]   If that's you, then listen. You won't feel worthy until God enters your story.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:28.120]   You want to feel worthy? If you're here and you don't know Jesus,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.840]   then you will find worth nowhere else.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.440]   You won't feel worthy until God enters your story.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.800]   That's why God gives Moses three different signs in verses 2
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   through 9 of chapter 4. He does it to boost his believability.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.080]   Not just so people believe, "Man, Moses really changed." But so people
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:53.000]   believe Moses was really changed by God. Like that's what God cares about. Like he
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.960]   isn't like the world that just wants to
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.480]   medicate us with self-help strategies, positive self-talk,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.840]   improve your self-image. He's not like that.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.240]   God doesn't just want you to become different. God wants to be the reason you
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.320]   become different because the difference he's going to make
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.520]   is a difference that no one else can make. And it'll be a difference the likes
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.280]   of which the world will look at and be like,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.960]   "That is crazy. Did you know that guy? Did you know that girl? Like I knew them
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.400]   back in the day. They were heinous. They were wild. They
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.920]   were crazy. And yet look at them now. Like they're
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.600]   not heathen, they're holy. Like something's changed. They have a
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.680]   different pep in their step. Like they're
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.640]   walking with a new kind of confidence." Because that sort of difference,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.920]   it won't come by way of anything in this world. It will come
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.000]   by way of only Christ.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.480]   That's what God cares about. That's why he turns Moses' staff
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.440]   into a snake. Like think about it. The pharaohs with their headdresses look
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   like what? Cobras. God is saying, "Hey, I have power
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.920]   over the powers in your story." Why does he do the whole bit with
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.200]   leprosy? Because God's saying, "Hey, I have power over life and death
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.480]   itself." The last sign he gives them is he turns
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.320]   water into blood. Like, "Hey, why does he do that? Why does he affect
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.280]   the Nile?" Because the Nile was seen as the sole source of provision
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.800]   to the fertile crescent, to the nation of Egypt. And yet God's saying, "No, no, no.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.400]   The Nile doesn't have the power to give and take away. I have the power to give
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:35.960]   and take away. I am the power to provide. Do you have the power to make a mess of
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:42.600]   your past? Yes, but God has the power
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.680]   to make something meaningful of your future.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.360]   He has the power to do that. A power the likes of which you will find nowhere
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.000]   else. Paul says it like this in 1 Corinthians 1,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.320]   28 and 29. He says, "God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.360]   the world, what is viewed as nothing, to bring to
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.800]   nothing what is viewed as something, so that no one may boast, only God, no
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.960]   one may boast in his presence." You see, God is the difference maker.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.480]   He's the sea splitter. He's the miracle worker. He's the storm calmer. He is the
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.920]   grace giver. Like, God's the one that can take
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.080]   back what you feel can never be taken back. He's the one that can heal what you
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.960]   feel can never be healed. He's the one that can clean what you feel
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.400]   is too deep a stain, the likes of which no one can ever actually make it well.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.320]   Because he gives grace like you wouldn't believe. And the reason we know it,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.680]   this porch, the reason we know it is because we don't need to look at three
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.560]   different signs. We need only look at one singular son,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.320]   the son of God, who stepped down into our story
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.680]   and was not merely preoccupied with our past. I've got to fix him.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.800]   He was crucified by your past. And yet when he rose forth from the grave,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.560]   he left all of your insecurity in the grave with him. He rose forth
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.760]   into new life. And if you place your faith in him,
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.280]   you can rise forth and have the same.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.680]   But Kyla and I, I know I'm forgiven. I know that.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.360]   Like, I'm not worried about my past. I've placed my faith in Jesus. It's not the
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.520]   past that I'm worried about. It's the future.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.240]   Like, yeah, I think God wants to do something, but man, I don't have, I don't
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.520]   have the raw materials to do it. Like, I see some of the places that he
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.320]   wants to lead me. I feel some of the dreams that I want to chase.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.040]   And I don't think that I have the ability. You see, your problem isn't
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.200]   insignificance. It's not insecurity. It's inadequacy.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.000]   So what do we do with that? Well, Moses deals with inadequacy too,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.600]   because we read this in verses 10 through 12.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:47.880]   "But Moses said to the Lord, 'Oh my Lord, I'm not eloquent, either in the past
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.320]   or since you've spoken to your servant, but I'm slow
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   of speech and of tongue.' And then the Lord said to him, 'Who has
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.120]   made man's mouth? Who makes him mute or deaf or seeing
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.840]   or blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now therefore go, and I'll be with your
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   mouth, and I'll teach you what you shall speak.'"
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.600]   You see, Moses sees all that God wants to do in his life,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.280]   and yet he resists the call of God, not once, not twice,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   not thrice, but five times, which just feels
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.320]   laughable when you read it all the way through. Not just because he's that
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   friend that keeps coming up with excuses and never is willing to commit to
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.040]   Friday night plans. No, it feels laughable because he has
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.520]   somehow forgotten the fact that he's talking to God.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:45.400]   And so he starts by telling God, "But Lord, I'm insignificant, like
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.840]   I'm a nobody from nowhere." And yet God's like, "No man, like I'm the one that's
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.800]   going to make you significant, but God, I've got insecurities. Like look at the
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.960]   things that I did in my past. Like I don't know,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.440]   everybody knows, and there's no coming back from that. Don't worry about those
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.640]   things. I can provide all the believability you
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.520]   need, the credibility gap you feel. I can fill it actually, but God, I'm not
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.720]   a, I'm inadequate. Like I don't have the the tools or the
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.520]   training to do that what you're calling me to do. There's got to be someone else.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.880]   You've got the wrong guy." And yet here's the crazy thing.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:21.400]   He's saying all of it to a burning bush, like this supernatural spectacle,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.760]   this unfathomable phenomenon. He is staring at a manifestation of the
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.400]   presence of God, and yet he is so engulfed by his
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.880]   inadequacies that he misses God standing right in
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.360]   front of him.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:46.440]   That's what happens when we can, when we become consumed by our constraints,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.320]   when we're engulfed by our inadequacies. Like contrary to the way a lot of people
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.880]   preach this passage, Moses isn't in the middle of an identity
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.600]   crisis. He knows exactly who he is. He is well
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.880]   acquainted with all of his weakness. He is telling
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.800]   God every one of his flaws. This story is not
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.280]   about a man that is delusional about all of, about who he is. This is a
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.240]   story about a man who is disappointed by who he is.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.920]   He knows he has problems, so much so that he can't even see past them
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.080]   to the plans that God has for his life.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.320]   Is that happening to you?
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:40.840]   Like, are you thinking too much of your problems that you're willing to punt
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:46.920]   on the plans God has for your life while you settle into sheep herding on
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.040]   the backside of nowhere?
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.840]   Is that you?
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:58.040]   Like, too often we look at ourselves and all we see is like, "I'm not smart enough
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.240]   to start that non-profit, God. Like, I know there's a great need and I want
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.520]   to fill it, but I'm not smart enough to do that." Or, "God, I know my family's got
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.920]   some problems. Many of them don't even believe in you, and yet, God,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.520]   I'm not bold enough to actually transcend being the kid young brother or
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.680]   the kid young sister. I actually am not enough to do that, Lord." Or, "God, I
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.040]   know I've got some problems and some pain that I really need to work through
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.400]   and some forgiveness I need to send, but God, I'm actually not strong enough
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.240]   to do those things." Or, "God, I'm not eloquent enough to preach
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.960]   your gospel to share Jesus Christ with my entire department, Lord.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.240]   Lord, I'm not faithful enough to believe that you can save
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.880]   my entire department, God. I don't think I'm enough, God. I'm not
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.960]   smart enough. I'm not witty enough. I'm not pretty enough.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.600]   I'm not funny enough, God. I'm not good enough. I'm just not enough."
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:51.400]   And yet, God answers Moses in the same way he answers you tonight,
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:57.000]   and in a way the likes of which I wouldn't have guessed.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.680]   He says, "Don't you think I know that?
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.840]   Do you think your weaknesses or your inadequacies, all the constraints and
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.320]   limitations you feel, you think that stuff catches me off guard?
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:22.200]   No, I made you that way. You're exactly as I want you to be. You are
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.400]   who I want you to be. If I wanted you to be someone else,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.080]   I would have made you into someone else. But no, you're exactly
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   as I want you to be."
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.640]   You see, Porch,
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.640]   if you're good enough for God, then you're enough as is.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.680]   If you are enough for God, then you are enough as is.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.120]   Now, am I saying that in this point to give you license to
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.560]   seek after your sin and indulge all your desires?
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.360]   No, that's not why we're talking about this. I'm saying this because so many of
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.600]   us, we look at ourselves
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.280]   and we know what God says about us, that he says I'm enough.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:20.200]   And yet that's just not enough for us. We know what God says, but we don't care
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.920]   what God says about us. We care what we say about ourselves.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.520]   You see, too often we want to be like the dudes at the gym.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.920]   We want to fudge our numbers and we want to make ourselves look way
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:40.040]   bigger than we actually are. And in the process of doing that,
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:49.000]   we expose ourselves for being far smaller than we actually want to be seen.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   We don't feel like we're enough. And so we feel like we need to
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.360]   get better. We need to grow up. We need to move on. We need to mature more
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.680]   quickly. We want to be smarter. We want to be stronger. We want to be
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.840]   braver. We want to be bolder. We want to be whatever it is for you.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.720]   Whatever it is you feel is insufficient in your life,
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.120]   you want for because you believe you're not enough for yourself. And because
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.720]   you're not enough for yourself, you'll never be enough for anybody else.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:23.800]   That's my story at least. Like as far back as I can remember
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.920]   and more frequently than I'd like to count,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.200]   I have fallen just shy of sufficient for the things that I've wanted in life.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.280]   Like whether it wasn't being popular enough in grade school or athletic
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.200]   enough in high school or impressive enough in college or smooth
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.920]   enough with the opposite sex or smart enough in the corporate world
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.880]   or even talented enough in ministry.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.480]   I have been repeatedly confronted by the fact
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.960]   that I don't care so much what other people have to say about me.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.000]   I care far more what I have to say about myself
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.560]   and what I have to say about myself in times past as I look in the rear view
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.920]   and I consider my story,
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.320]   is I see a life littered with limitations all pronouncing the same
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.880]   judgment
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.640]   that I'm not enough.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:30.440]   I felt for so long like I was in a perpetual state of second place
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   that I was nobody's first choice and as I grew older and I
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.840]   processed my past what I eventually learned is
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.280]   is because I was so dissatisfied with myself that dissatisfaction didn't just
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.920]   turn into into uh into a fear of of of
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.080]   falling short and failing along the way. No what it turned into was
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.320]   a deep-seated self-hate.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:02.280]   I hated my hardwiring, hated my personality,
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.600]   I hated the way that God made me to be because I had dreamed dreams
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.920]   so great and yet I was so small and insignificant,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:18.120]   too small and insecure, too small and inadequate to reach them.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.200]   I found myself where Moses finds himself at the very end of this story like after
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.480]   he rolls out all of the excuses that he can give
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.840]   God he has nothing left to hide behind and so he just looks at the Lord and
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.520]   says God I don't even like who I am. Like God I'm not enough so God please
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   just pick somebody else. Like God I've given up on myself. I don't
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   want to move forward. I don't want to lean into the life you'd
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.840]   have for me God. The purposes you have they're far too big
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.440]   because my perspective of self is far too small. God please
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.200]   choose someone else and I love the way the story ends
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.160]   because it says that God is angered which feels like such a weird swerve.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.080]   Like God why would you be angry in this moment and yet God is
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.840]   never once angered over the course of this passage. Like as Moses
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.920]   rolls out all of his resistance and he puts forward all of his pushback
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.760]   God works through every single excuse and yet the moment when Moses
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.120]   is finally willing to just give up on himself
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:26.680]   God's angered. No Moses don't do it. I've not given up on you. I've got
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   plans for your life. I've got something I want to do.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:37.000]   You may feel too small but I am too big. I can make up for whatever weakness you
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.120]   feel. I am strong enough to bridge the
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.440]   bridge the divide to fill the gap to lead you where we're gonna go.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.520]   But don't give up. Don't say you want someone else
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.160]   because I don't want anyone else. I want you.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.240]   And as I experienced the truth of that message in my life it changed
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:05.800]   everything. It unlocked me from all of these these self-deprecating
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.600]   self-shaming self-hating thoughts.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.520]   It allowed me to walk with God
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.760]   and in a way that I wouldn't have dared dream be possible.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.400]   I would never have thought I'd do the things I've done.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:31.720]   I'd be the places I am. I'd know him like I do.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:38.520]   Friends if you're here and you want to move from feeling so
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:46.360]   despicable to feeling so desirable desired by God in heaven
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.320]   then take it from someone who knows. You don't need to keep looking at
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.880]   yourself. You need to start looking to him. You need
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.400]   to see that Jesus Christ he came into your
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.960]   insignificance. He was seeking you in life when you were
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.200]   you were too unimportant to seek. You need to look to Jesus Christ who came
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.560]   into your insecurities who served you in a death when you were
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.760]   too unworthy to love. And you need to look to Jesus Christ who
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.640]   came into your insecurities saving you with a resurrection that has
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:24.120]   that has qualified you for everlasting life.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.080]   If you're here and you want a new perspective on yourself
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   then don't look inward before you look upward.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.000]   You look to him and in seeing him rightly
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I promise you'll see yourself rightly as a result.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.720]   And let me pray for us. God we love you. God I want this this truth so badly for
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   these people because God this story feels like my
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:58.360]   story. My life wracked and riddled by so much self-hate.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.400]   And I know God there are some in this room that feel the same way that look at
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.760]   themselves and and they're just disgusted. They're just
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.280]   disappointed. They just want for more. They've got a
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.520]   dream, a desire, a goal, an ambition they want to reach God. And
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.400]   it's not even self-seeking God. It's to make a difference in the world. And yet
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.200]   God they look at themselves and say I don't have the raw materials. I don't
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   have the right resources. I don't have the sort of faculties required to get me
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.600]   to that place. And yet God you look at them and you say
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.720]   no I want you as you are because I'm going to use you as you are.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.080]   The worse the odds the greater the glory for me.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.560]   You may feel weak but into your weakness I will make myself strong. And the reason
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.800]   we know is because God into the weakness of our sin
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.760]   you made yourself most strong because you sent Jesus to save us
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.040]   forever. If you don't know Jesus Christ then you can be saved tonight.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.440]   And you can find all of the significance and all the security
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.520]   and all the adequacy that he offers by simply receiving
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   the gift of salvation by placing your faith in him.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.560]   Others of you you're going to need to process with someone. That's what we're
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.800]   here for. That's what tonight's about and we're
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.160]   going to do it as long as it's required. But God we love you
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.120]   and we sing to you now it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
