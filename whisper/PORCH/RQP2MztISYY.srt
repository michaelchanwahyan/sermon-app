00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,820
 Love it.

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,340
 Well, I don't know what caused conflict in your family

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,980
 with your siblings when you were a kid,

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,180
 but when I was really young, younger than 10,

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,340
 my brothers and I would always fight over something

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,540
 called Sega Genesis.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,220
 And if you're younger than--

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,180
 or if you weren't born after like 1985,

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,100
 you probably don't know what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,860
 We'd always fight over NBA Jam and Sonic the Hedgehog,

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,360
 and this would lead to all kinds of conflicts in our house.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,780
 And on one of these occasions, my younger brother,

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,740
 who was seven and I was nine at the time,

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
 got into a fight playing NBA Jam.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,620
 Someone cheated, and all of a sudden, there's

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,540
 a fist fight going on.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,860
 And my mom walks into the room.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,780
 She says, that's it.

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,060
 I'm taking away Sega, and you're both getting spankings.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,060
 This was like before the spanking ban that's

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,620
 taking place.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,540
 And so I immediately and my brother

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,540
 walk to the edge of her bedroom, and she

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,820
 says, Michael, who's my little brother, you're up first.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,580
 So he takes her in there.

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,080
 And my mom was the kind of mom that

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,020
 would sit you down and walk you through.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,280
 Do you understand what you did?

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,820
 Do you know that this hurts me more than it hurts you?

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,460
 When you're nine, you're like, but I always leave crying.

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,260
 How does it hurt you?

33
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,740
 And so she would walk through that whole experience.

34
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,220
 So that's going on, and she told me, stay outside the door.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,620
 Stand right here, and I'll get to you next.

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,060
 So the door shuts, and it hits me.

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,860
 I've got like a minute and a half, maybe two minutes.

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,340
 And so immediately, I take off up the stairs,

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,940
 and I go and begin to put on every pair of underwear

40
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,780
 and shorts that I own to create an insulation where

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,700
 the paddle, which we had like a spanking paddle, would strike.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,220
 And so my little brother comes out, quack, quack, ah,

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,540
 and he comes out of the room.

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,420
 And now it's my turn.

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,420
 So I'm going in more confident than normal, and I sit down.

46
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,540
 Yes, I understand I've done something really wrong.

47
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,700
 Yes, I'm repentant.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,060
 She bends me over, and she realizes what's going on.

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,300
 To which she looks and says, great, OK, well,

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,100
 we'll just wait for your father to get home.

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,260
 And I immediately knew, because then you

52
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,860
 longed for the paddle, because then the belt came out,

53
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,180
 and it got really, really bad, and no amount of padding

54
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,140
 could help you.

55
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,660
 And so that was my first experience of a principle

56
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,780
 that really all of us can relate to, and all of us

57
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,900
 have experienced in life, of rebellion.

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,260
 When you rebel against a command,

59
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,980
 whether it be from God or from your parents

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,900
 or whatever authority you're underneath,

61
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,500
 there always is pain brought into your life.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,300
 And in that scenario, I was further

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,900
 introduced that the more you rebel,

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,740
 the more pain will oftentimes be brought

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,660
 into your life and to my life.

66
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,460
 And so as you and I go throughout life,

67
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,500
 if you and I in any arena of life

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,060
 begin to rebel against God's authority or God's commands,

69
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,780
 we will introduce pain into our life.

70
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,500
 And tonight, we're going to study the last three

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,420
 kings of Judah as we continue this series Game of Thrones.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,860
 And more than any other of the kings that I know of,

73
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,660
 they illustrate this principle that rebellion always

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,460
 brings pain.

75
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,020
 And when you go against what God has said,

76
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,940
 you go against life, and you will bring pain.

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,700
 Their names are King Jehoiakim, King Jehoiachin,

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
 and King Zedekiah, which I know everyone's really excited

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
 to write those down, which you can't spell.

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,540
 So this will be the best sermon you've ever

81
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
 heard on King Zedekiah, because it'll probably

82
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,660
 be the only one you've ever heard on King Zedekiah.

83
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,160
 But these men-- and you may go, why are we talking about them?

84
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,940
 What's interesting about these three kings

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,700
 is that 84 chapters--

86
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,180
 think about this--

87
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,820
 84 chapters in your Bible and in my Bible

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,620
 talk about these three kings.

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,700
 The whole book of Jeremiah, the whole--

90
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,660
 or the first half of Ezekiel, Lamentations,

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,140
 2 Chronicles 36, 2 Kings all speak of these men.

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,780
 It was something about their story

93
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,900
 that God wanted to make sure you and I know.

94
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,020
 I mean, Noah gets four chapters.

95
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,660
 Abraham gets 12.

96
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,260
 Yet these three kings, which we're going to observe tonight,

97
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,180
 get 84 different chapters.

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,660
 So we're going to be in the book of 2 Kings.

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,780
 And here's further what's going to be unique about tonight

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,860
 is we're going to jump around between 2 Kings 24 and 25,

101
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,260
 if you want to write that down and you're the kind of person

102
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,140
 who likes to go read it later, or 2 Chronicles 36,

103
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,620
 and then different parts of Jeremiah,

104
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,980
 because the entire book of Jeremiah

105
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,100
 is written as it related to these two kings.

106
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,340
 So let me give you a little bit of recap about what's

107
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,460
 even in the Bible and where we are as it relates

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,580
 to these books.

109
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,820
 So Game of Thrones is the study of the kings of Israel.

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,580
 There was this few hundred years

111
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,220
 where Israel had these kings.

112
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,380
 And the Old Testament is all about the history

113
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,520
 of the nation of Israel.

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
 So inside of the Old Testament,

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,340
 there's this little section that tells us

116
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,300
 about the kings of Israel.

117
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,660
 It's called the historical books.

118
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
 If you've ever read 1 Chronicles or 2 Chronicles,

119
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,960
 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings,

120
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,580
 you can read about the kings of Israel.

121
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,960
 And here's what's further interesting.

122
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,880
 During that same time period of the kings,

123
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,860
 there were these men called the prophets.

124
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,140
 And the prophets are those pages in the middle

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,900
 of your Bible that it just seems like the guys

126
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,220
 are really angry, and I will bring calamity on you,

127
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,460
 and disaster, and I will do this and this.

128
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,140
 And that was the prophets.

129
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,780
 And those prophets lived, many of them,

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,740
 during the same time period of the kings.

131
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,600
 And they speak about the same events

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,580
 that are going on with the kings.

133
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,980
 And so during this three-king reign,

134
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,700
 Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah,

135
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,020
 there's a man named Jeremiah who writes his entire book

136
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,820
 about these three men.

137
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,500
 And so that's what's going on as we jump in right here.

138
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,900
 So last week, in the last couple weeks,

139
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,540
 we discovered the nation of Israel,

140
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,340
 they got a king, and God said, "You don't want a king.

141
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,320
 "It's gonna be really, really bad if you get a king."

142
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,460
 They said, "No, no, no, we want a king.

143
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
 "Give us a king."

144
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,780
 He said, "Fine, you can have a king."

145
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,220
 And that began a long series of one bad king

146
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,300
 after the next bad king after the next bad king.

147
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,620
 The nation split up, and it just got really bad.

148
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,140
 So much so that where our story picks up,

149
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,860
 the nation has split into two,

150
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
 and the southern kingdom, Judah,

151
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,980
 has just totally fallen apart.

152
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,900
 There's child sacrifice going on

153
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,100
 in the streets of Jerusalem and all throughout Judah.

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,460
 The temple where God was to be worshipped

155
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,060
 was filled with all these idols.

156
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,660
 They'd totally fallen apart because of one bad king

157
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,880
 after the next, and the nation refused to repent.

158
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,380
 And so these three kings now have their chance

159
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,020
 to turn and repent, return the nation,

160
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,340
 to turn back to God.

161
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,100
 And so we're gonna see what happens.

162
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,620
 But because of so many bad decisions

163
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,580
 made by all the kings in the last couple hundred years,

164
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,380
 God basically said, "Hey, nation of Israel,

165
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,960
 "you're grounded, no more Sega Genesis for you."

166
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
 Maybe you had parents that would say,

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,820
 "You're grounded," or "You're spanked," or whatever it is.

168
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,460
 When God would punish or discipline the nation of Israel,

169
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,780
 here's what he would do.

170
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,620
 He would bring in a foreign country

171
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,080
 to conquer his people and say,

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,400
 "Hey, I want you to turn back and worship me,

173
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,380
 "and if you do, then I'll get rid of this foreign army

174
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,480
 "that's coming and conquering.

175
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,980
 "But if you don't, then I will let you have foreign gods

176
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,460
 "and a foreign ruler."

177
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,100
 So at this time, Babylon has come in,

178
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,860
 and it's conquered Judah.

179
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,740
 And this is around 600 BC.

180
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,640
 You guys with me?

181
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,700
 And so around 600 BC, Judah has just so rebelled

182
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,620
 that God says, "Fine, I'm gonna give you over to Babylon."

183
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,300
 So Babylon comes in, they've conquered the known world,

184
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,640
 and they're led by a guy named Nebuchadnezzar.

185
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,480
 And he sets up Jehoiakim,

186
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,860
 who would be the third to last king in Judah's history.

187
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,100
 The second king's 24, which is where we'll be.

188
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,620
 I would say if you are the kind of person

189
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,360
 who likes to follow along, tonight may frustrate you,

190
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,900
 'cause we're gonna move and jump back.

191
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,180
 So write these down, and you can read it later.

192
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,380
 And for the next 20 minutes,

193
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,900
 it's gonna be a really unusual message,

194
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
 because we're just gonna go and see a movie.

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,860
 I'm gonna take you through the story and see what happens,

196
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,120
 and then at the end, we'll get a takeaway

197
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,620
 where we can all learn from the mistakes

198
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,460
 of these three kings.

199
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,280
 So here we go.

200
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,540
 This is 2 Kings 21.

201
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,140
 It's about Jehoiakim, who's our first king,

202
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,620
 and he's underneath Nebuchadnezzar.

203
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
 This is what it says.

204
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,340
 "During Jehoiakim's reign,

205
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,220
 "Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded the land,

206
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,140
 "and Jehoiakim became his vassal,

207
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,180
 "or his puppet king, for three years."

208
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,700
 So Nebuchadnezzar comes in, he says,

209
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,260
 "Jehoiakim, look, I'm gonna let you stay in power,

210
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,620
 "but you're really my errand boy.

211
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,340
 "Just pay me my taxes.

212
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,740
 "Don't do anything stupid,

213
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,100
 "and you can still have whatever crown you want around here,

214
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,180
 "but you're not really the king, I'm the king."

215
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,220
 And so here's what happens.

216
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,220
 But then, he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled.

217
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,480
 So three years go by, and he goes,

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,860
 "Look, I'm sick of being the errand boy.

219
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,020
 "You know what, I'm the king.

220
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,920
 "I'm done with this.

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
 "I'm gonna rebel against Nebuchadnezzar."

222
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,060
 And here's, I've tried to think all week

223
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,860
 about how to communicate how insane this was.

224
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,660
 The nation of Judah, rebelling against King Nebuchadnezzar,

225
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,180
 who had conquered the known world,

226
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,620
 would be a little bit like this.

227
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,260
 It would be like Fort Worth,

228
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,700
 for you guys out there in Fort Worth,

229
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,820
 or Tarrant County within Fort Worth,

230
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,700
 rebelling against the state of Texas.

231
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
 That would be what it was like.

232
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,840
 And you may be thinking over in Fort Worth,

233
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,400
 "Yeah, yeah, remember, come and take it.

234
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,860
 "We got a lot of guns over in Fort Worth.

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,700
 "This isn't Dallas.

236
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
 "We got guns, we bringing guns to the ports."

237
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
 And you may put the fort back in Fort Worth.

238
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300
 And so any attempt that you would make,

239
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,400
 like that, didn't you?

240
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,940
 But regardless, no matter how many guns you have,

241
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,540
 it wouldn't stand against Fort Hood, or Fort Sam Houston,

242
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,060
 that it would just be insane, and eventually it would fall.

243
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,060
 And so God raises up the prophet Jeremiah,

244
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,460
 because he spoke to the nation,

245
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,260
 and spoke to the king through the prophet.

246
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,180
 He goes to Jehoiakim, and he says,

247
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,400
 "Hey, this is a bad idea.

248
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,240
 "We're not gonna win this fight,

249
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
 "not only because we are Fort Worth, and it's Texas,

250
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,780
 "but because God is judging the nation.

251
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,860
 "He wants us to worry not about going to war,

252
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,860
 "but about who we're gonna worship, and turn back to him.

253
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
 "And so what are we gonna do?"

254
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,620
 And so Jeremiah gets this message from God.

255
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,340
 And God says, "Hey, I want you to write this down,

256
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,500
 "and the king will read it, and hopefully,

257
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,380
 "he won't go to war against Nebuchadnezzar."

258
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,860
 And God gives him the message, and here's what it says.

259
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,920
 "Jehoiakim, if you go to war, you will die.

260
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
 "It will go bad for you.

261
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,660
 "You need to tell the nation to get rid of the idols.

262
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,320
 "If you go to war, everything will be destroyed,

263
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,260
 "and you will suffer.

264
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,140
 "If you rebel, you will suffer for it."

265
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,700
 And so eventually, this scroll,

266
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,940
 King Jehoiakim knows that Jeremiah wrote it,

267
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,400
 so he goes, "Hey, somebody go get me that scroll.

268
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,500
 "I wanna see what it says.

269
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,180
 "I know that God speaks through him sometimes."

270
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,140
 So he goes, and he gets it, and he's sitting,

271
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,940
 the scripture tells us this, Jeremiah 36,

272
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,780
 if you wanna read it later.

273
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,260
 He's sitting inside of his winter part of the palace,

274
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,660
 and he's sitting in front of a fire,

275
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,300
 and he asks, "Hey, somebody read me the scroll."

276
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,700
 And so one of his servants begins to read the scroll,

277
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,940
 and it's like, "If you rebel,

278
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,180
 "I'm gonna bring calamity on you and disaster,

279
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,640
 "and if you do this, your children and your throne

280
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,940
 "will be disintegrated."

281
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,700
 And at every page that's read,

282
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,940
 Jehoiakim looks, he takes the page,

283
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,280
 rips it out, and throws it in the fire.

284
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
 Read another one.

285
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,460
 And it says he showed no fear or any sign of repentance.

286
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,680
 That he refused, I'm just not gonna listen to that.

287
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,300
 Prophet.

288
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,180
 And so this, I mean, we really can all relate to this.

289
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,380
 When someone comes into our life

290
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,860
 and they tell us something we don't wanna hear,

291
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,740
 "Hey, I don't think you should do that, that's illegal,"

292
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,700
 or "I don't think you should date her,"

293
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,820
 or "I don't think you guys should hang out together,"

294
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,200
 or "Y'all shouldn't move in together,"

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
 there's something inside of all of us that can go,

296
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,740
 "You know what, well, I'm just not gonna listen

297
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,640
 "to you anymore.

298
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,740
 "Every party needs a pooper,

299
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,380
 "and so I'm not gonna invite you to my parties anymore."

300
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
 Right?

301
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,500
 Like we've all at least seen this play out,

302
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
 and so that's what Jehoiakim's doing.

303
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,280
 He's going, "Look, I'm just not gonna listen, Jeremiah.

304
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,120
 "I'm the king.

305
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,540
 "We're gonna rebel against King Nebuchadnezzar."

306
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,700
 So here's what happens.

307
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,340
 This is 2 Chronicles 36.

308
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,740
 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him,

309
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,500
 and he bound, speaking about Jehoiakim,

310
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,860
 so Nebuchadnezzar shows up,

311
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,580
 and he bound him with bronze shackles

312
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,180
 to take him to Babylon,

313
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,380
 and he also took Babylon articles

314
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,820
 from the temple of the Lord

315
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,940
 and put them in his temple there.

316
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,180
 So one day, there's a knock at the door,

317
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
 and it's Nebuchadnezzar,

318
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,340
 and the scripture says there was no war.

319
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,020
 He just walked in, he got off of his horse,

320
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,660
 he said, "Jehoiakim, you're coming with me,"

321
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,540
 and he led him back in bronze shackles to Babylon

322
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,540
 as the city watched their king tied up and led away,

323
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,820
 and Jeremiah's sitting there thinking,

324
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,660
 "What were you thinking?

325
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,960
 "I told you, you can't go against God's word.

326
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,360
 "If you go against God's word, you're going to lose,"

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,540
 and that's what happened,

328
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,820
 and then something happens.

329
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,300
 Nebuchadnezzar, on his way out,

330
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,980
 he says to Jehoiachin, who was Jehoiakim's son,

331
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,960
 "Hey, look, you're the king now,

332
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
 "but you're not really the king,

333
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
 "so just pay me my taxes

334
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,160
 "unless you wanna come with dad here.

335
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,520
 "Just send me the money,

336
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,480
 "and just don't do anything stupid,

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,660
 "and everything will be fine,"

338
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,780
 and so the story continues.

339
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,180
 This is back in 2 Kings,

340
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,300
 and Jehoiachin is not the sharpest crown in the box,

341
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,140
 as we're gonna see.

342
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,020
 Here we go, verse eight.

343
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,420
 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king.

344
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,580
 That's probably some of the problem right there.

345
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,060
 This is like a high school senior who's ruling a nation,

346
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,740
 and he reigned, check this out,

347
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,720
 in Jerusalem three months.

348
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,900
 The scripture tells us that three months went by,

349
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,560
 and Jehoiachin went, "You know what?

350
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,840
 "I think we can take him.

351
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,440
 "I think we can take on Nebuchadnezzar.

352
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,280
 "We're gonna be free.

353
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,100
 "Who's with me?

354
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,940
 "Who wants to be free?

355
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,780
 "Let's do this,"

356
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,640
 and so he began to raise up an army,

357
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,660
 and began to refuse to pay taxes,

358
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,140
 and said, "What, what are you gonna do, Neb?

359
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,180
 "Come and get it,"

360
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,220
 and so the story continues with Jeremiah coming

361
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,940
 to this guy going, "Excuse me.

362
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,140
 "Hey, remember me?

363
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,880
 "I was friends with your dad.

364
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,080
 "Do you think this is a good idea?

365
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 "Oh, you're gonna rebel?

366
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,580
 "Anybody else rebelled recently that you know of?

367
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,900
 "Oh, your father.

368
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,320
 "How'd that go for him?

369
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
 "Oh, it's gonna be different for you this time.

370
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,380
 "This is a bad, bad idea, Jehoiachin.

371
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,920
 "If you do this, God has spoken.

372
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,420
 "You will pay for it for the rest of your life,

373
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,080
 "and the nation will pay for it.

374
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,860
 "It's not about how do we win this war.

375
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,600
 "It's about who are we gonna worship.

376
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,100
 "Turn back to God.

377
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,400
 "Get rid of the idols throughout the country.

378
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
 "God is punishing you until that takes place,

379
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,260
 "or he's allowing these foreign rulers to rule over you."

380
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,960
 And Jehoiachin says, "No, I'm the king,"

381
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,860
 and so here's what happened.

382
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,580
 Verse 15, Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive

383
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,740
 to Babylon.

384
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,040
 He also took from Jerusalem the king's mother,

385
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,880
 his wives, his officials,

386
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,300
 and the prominent people of the land, verse 16.

387
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,800
 So Nebuchadnezzar shows up, says, "All right, great.

388
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
 "We have to do this again.

389
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,440
 "You're coming with me.

390
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,860
 "Your whole family's coming with me,

391
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,320
 "and not only that, check this out.

392
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,100
 "The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon

393
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,600
 "the entire force of 7,000 fighting men,

394
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,660
 "strong and fit for war,

395
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,400
 "1,000 skilled workers and artisans."

396
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
 So the scripture tells us,

397
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,980
 Nebuchadnezzar does something really, really smart.

398
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,460
 He shows up, "All right, I don't wanna do this again,

399
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
 "so here's what we're gonna do.

400
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,920
 "Jehoiachin, you're coming with me again,

401
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,320
 "and all of the army, you're coming with me as well,

402
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,660
 "and all the upper class."

403
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,060
 He takes everyone who makes over $100,000.

404
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,740
 "All of you guys, you're coming with me.

405
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,480
 "We're all going back to Babylon."

406
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,040
 And Jeremiah's sitting there going,

407
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,060
 "Why would you not listen to me?

408
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,400
 "I'm telling you, you can't go against God's word

409
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,540
 "and win," and they watch as they lead out Jehoiachin,

410
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,300
 the whole royal family,

411
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
 led out through the streets of Jerusalem,

412
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,400
 and they take him out, and they take all the upper class,

413
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,900
 and so now the city is having to say goodbye

414
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,700
 to their neighbors, some of their family members,

415
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,060
 who are all being taken away thousands of miles.

416
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,660
 Imagine if that happened here, if Canada,

417
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,700
 I don't know how that could be possible,

418
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,220
 but came in and conquered,

419
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,940
 and they led all of us back to Canada,

420
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,220
 or large chunks of our country back to Canada.

421
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,040
 How sad that would be, and you're sitting there,

422
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,860
 Jeremiah, you're going, "It doesn't have to be like this.

423
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
 "It doesn't have to be, obey.

424
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,460
 "Obey, you can't go against the word of the Lord and win.

425
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,020
 "Rebellion always brings pain."

426
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,380
 So surrender to God and submit to Nebuchadnezzar.

427
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,460
 And so on his way out,

428
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,960
 Nebuchadnezzar sets up Zedekiah,

429
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,420
 who would be the last king that Judah would ever have.

430
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,620
 And he sets up Zedekiah, and he goes,

431
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,380
 "Okay, Zedekiah, here you go, three rules.

432
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,920
 "Ready for this?

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,120
 "The first two guys didn't get it,

434
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,820
 "so here's three rules, Zedekiah.

435
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,980
 "You're not the king, I'm the king.

436
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,940
 "You pay me my taxes, okay, rule number one.

437
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,820
 "Rule number two, you get no army.

438
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,120
 "I'm taking the army, don't raise an army.

439
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,840
 "Rule number three, do not rebuild these walls

440
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,680
 "around this city.

441
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,080
 "I want you to be weak and vulnerable.

442
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,520
 "You do not do those three things.

443
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,980
 "If I hear you do those three things,

444
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,300
 "I am coming back here to get you, Zedekiah."

445
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,020
 And so Zedekiah's just on the throne going,

446
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,500
 "Oh my gosh, I'm the king of Judah?

447
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,580
 "This hat, I have the whole palace?"

448
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,380
 And he's just, I don't know if he can't pay attention

449
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,140
 to what it is, but he does not listen again.

450
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,980
 And we would think,

451
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,100
 "Oh, he just saw those two bad examples, uh-uh."

452
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,380
 And Zedekiah unfolds the rest of the story.

453
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,940
 Verse 11, here's what happens.

454
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,820
 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king,

455
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,940
 and he reigned in Jerusalem 11 years.

456
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,580
 He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord his God,

457
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,380
 and he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet,

458
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,520
 who spoke the word of the Lord to him.

459
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,000
 That Jeremiah goes again to the king and says,

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
 "You just saw what happened.

461
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,940
 "God is giving Israel or Judah its last chance.

462
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,680
 "Obey the Lord, obey him.

463
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,560
 "Submit to Zedekiah, or submit to Nebuchadnezzar,

464
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,640
 "and obey the word of the Lord."

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,400
 And it says, "He refused to listen."

466
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,260
 I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

467
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,680
 I don't care what God says.

468
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,380
 I don't care what anyone says.

469
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,440
 I can control the outcome,

470
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,900
 and I can control the consequences.

471
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,580
 We're gonna move in together.

472
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,300
 We're gonna sleep together.

473
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,660
 I don't really care what anyone else thinks.

474
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,760
 No, I'm not gonna do that.

475
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,260
 Community is for somebody else.

476
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,020
 Reading their Bible is for somebody else.

477
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,780
 I know, but I'm only 24.

478
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,920
 This can't really hurt me.

479
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,960
 Maybe someday I'll get cleaned up.

480
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,120
 And Zedekiah invited through rebellion

481
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,640
 the consequences that would take place.

482
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,960
 Here we go.

483
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,880
 Verse 13, "And he," does something very, very stupid,

484
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,960
 "he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar,

485
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,400
 "who made him take an oath in his God's name.

486
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,900
 "He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart

487
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,440
 "and would not turn back to the Lord."

488
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,200
 And Jeremiah's going again.

489
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,720
 Look, this is like Groundhog Day.

490
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
 Are you kidding me?

491
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,240
 We just saw this happen.

492
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,920
 Just the characters are changing.

493
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,560
 God is not going to honor your rebellion.

494
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,600
 If you rebel, Zedekiah, you die.

495
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,720
 And he goes back to the king.

496
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,440
 And if you read the book of Jeremiah,

497
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,520
 you feel for Jeremiah because he's like

498
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,960
 the only person in this story who's willing

499
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,080
 to listen to the word of the Lord.

500
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,480
 Zedekiah begins to raise up an army.

501
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,960
 He begins to build up the walls,

502
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
 and he's going, "I'm the king.

503
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
 "I mean, it's not gonna happen to me.

504
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,260
 "It happened to those guys,

505
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,000
 "but those two kings were losers.

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,840
 "I'm different.

507
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,080
 "It's gonna be different."

508
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,300
 And so all the people are going,

509
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,160
 "Yes, we're gonna be free again."

510
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
 The nation of Judah's going,

511
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
 "We don't have to be under Nebuchadnezzar."

512
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,360
 And the people are behind Zedekiah,

513
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,200
 and they're all excited.

514
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,520
 We're gonna be free.

515
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,940
 And so one day, they're having like a pep rally

516
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,220
 where everyone's together going,

517
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,280
 "Yes, freedom, freedom."

518
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
 And they're all hanging out together.

519
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,280
 That's not really in there if you read it,

520
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,480
 but it is like a gathering.

521
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,120
 And they all come together,

522
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,400
 and the people are stoked.

523
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,760
 We're gonna be free again.

524
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,180
 And Jeremiah, poor Jeremiah, he shows up,

525
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,480
 and he's going, "Okay, nobody seems to get the message,

526
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
 "so I'm gonna get a little creative."

527
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
 So he does an arts and crafts project,

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,200
 and he makes a yoke that an ox would wear,

529
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,680
 and he puts it on his back.

530
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,220
 And he shows up at the pep rally and goes,

531
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,480
 "Can I get one word here?

532
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,620
 "You see this yoke I'm wearing?

533
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,880
 "God wants the nation of Judah to wear the yoke

534
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,360
 "of Nebuchadnezzar just like I'm wearing this yoke.

535
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 "And so if you don't, everybody's gonna die."

536
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,640
 And literally, in the midst of his speech,

537
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,180
 one of the king's right-hand men

538
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,980
 goes up and goes, "God gave me a word, too.

539
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,040
 "We're gonna break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar!"

540
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,920
 And everyone goes nuts.

541
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,080
 And Jeremiah's going, "First off,

542
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,160
 "that took some time to make.

543
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,420
 "Second off, you're idiots,

544
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,800
 "and you will not win this fight.

545
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,520
 "You're not only fighting the Babylonian empire,

546
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,700
 "you're fighting against God, who has promised,

547
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,240
 "and through his word told you, you cannot win this fight."

548
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
 And so a couple years go by,

549
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,540
 and Zedekiah's thinking, "Hey, everything's going well."

550
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,100
 Scripture tells us that people begin to write their family,

551
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,140
 who'd been in exile, like they're writing letters.

552
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,820
 "Hey, can't wait to have you back home, Sally.

553
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,300
 "We're gonna rebel."

554
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,020
 And Jeremiah starts writing follow-up letters, saying,

555
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,180
 "Hey, get comfortable.

556
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,500
 "You're not coming home anytime soon."

557
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,640
 And that's where he introduces,

558
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,160
 "Seek the welfare of the city you live in,

559
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,140
 "for I know the plans I have for you,"

560
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,660
 declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you

561
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,680
 "and not bring you harm, Israel,

562
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,740
 "but you've gotta obey me."

563
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,140
 And so Jeremiah says, "Stay there,

564
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,980
 "and we're just all gonna buckle up back here,

565
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,660
 "'cause it's not going to be good."

566
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,800
 And so eventually, word gets back to Nebuchadnezzar

567
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,940
 that Zedekiah is not paying taxes,

568
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,500
 he's rebuilding the wall, and it's about to go bad.

569
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 Here's what happens.

570
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,420
 This is in 2 Kings 25, if you wanna read it later.

571
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,180
 On January 15th, January 15th,

572
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,740
 the walls have been built back up, we've got an army.

573
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,780
 Zedekiah is woken up, and they say,

574
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,860
 "Zedekiah, you gotta come see this."

575
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,740
 And he walks outside of his palace room,

576
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,440
 and this is in 587, on January 15th.

577
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,100
 We have so much documentation around this, it's amazing.

578
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,700
 And he walks up to the city wall, and he looks out,

579
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 and there is a vast, vast, vast army

580
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,180
 totally surrounding the city.

581
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,380
 The scripture tells us that Nebuchadnezzar

582
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,260
 brought everybody, he was mad.

583
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,940
 He brought the whole army, he brought the cooks,

584
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,540
 he brought all the slaves, he brought the camels,

585
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,060
 because they came to basically camp out for two years.

586
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,780
 Here's what they did, Nebuchadnezzar was really,

587
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,040
 really smart, and so Zedekiah is looking out,

588
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,700
 and he's never seen an army like this.

589
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,300
 They have more people in the army

590
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,180
 than in this city of just poor people.

591
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,000
 And he's looking out, and he's thinking,

592
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,820
 "Uh-oh, this is not gonna be good."

593
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,500
 And what happens is Nebuchadnezzar begins to build a wall

594
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,620
 around the outside of the Jerusalem walls,

595
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
 and they put archers on their wall,

596
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,980
 and they say, "If anyone comes out, we kill 'em."

597
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,180
 And for 18 months, the city sat under siege,

598
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 and they starved.

599
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,560
 And so Zedekiah is now backed into a wall,

600
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,380
 so he sends for Jeremiah.

601
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,060
 And he had Jeremiah thrown in prison,

602
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,860
 'cause he kept on being a buzzkill for everybody.

603
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,020
 Hey, quit saying that.

604
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,660
 And so he gets Jeremiah out of prison,

605
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,820
 and he says, "Jeremiah, will you pray to the Lord

606
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,460
 "that maybe he'll do something special here,

607
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,860
 "and he'll take those people down?"

608
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,600
 And Jeremiah's going, "I'm not gonna pray.

609
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,860
 "God said you can't win this fight.

610
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,640
 "You have one good option here.

611
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,100
 "Go out and surrender, and put yourself underneath

612
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,860
 "the power of Nebuchadnezzar."

613
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,800
 And Zedekiah thinks about it, and he goes,

614
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,820
 "I don't like that idea."

615
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,340
 And he asks him, "Is there anything else I can do?"

616
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,500
 And here's what Jeremiah says to him.

617
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,020
 This is Jeremiah 38.

618
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,880
 "Then Jeremiah said," starting in verse 17,

619
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,900
 "to Zedekiah, 'This is what the Lord God Almighty,

620
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,340
 "'the God of Israel, says.'"

621
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,860
 You got one option.

622
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,820
 "If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,

623
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,000
 "your life will be spared, and the city

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,360
 "will not be burned down.

625
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,260
 "You and your family will live."

626
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,180
 In other words, I'm inviting you to surrender to life.

627
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,420
 Surrender, and not just surrender in hopes

628
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
 that you'll make it.

629
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,500
 Jeremiah says, "I promise if you surrender,

630
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,860
 "you will be guaranteed life.

631
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,820
 "But if you don't," verse 18, "if you will not surrender

632
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,380
 "the officers of the king of Babylon,

633
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,960
 "the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians.

634
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,240
 "They will burn it down, and you yourself

635
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,500
 "will not escape from them."

636
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 And then Jeremiah said this, "Obey the word of the Lord

637
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,340
 "by doing what I tell you.

638
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,080
 "You got one last chance.

639
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,620
 "Your only hope is to surrender,

640
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,100
 "and throw yourself on the mercy of Nebuchadnezzar,

641
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,380
 "the mercy of God.

642
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,440
 "Obey the word of the Lord."

643
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,540
 Well, Zedekiah says, "I don't like that option."

644
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,780
 This is like when you're backed into a corner,

645
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,280
 and there really isn't any good options at this point

646
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,140
 that you're going to like.

647
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,900
 And he says, "No, I'm not gonna do it.

648
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,500
 "We're just gonna stay in this city.

649
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,080
 "And if he wants to come and fight, we'll fight,

650
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,820
 "but I'm not gonna do it.

651
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,860
 "I won't surrender."

652
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,380
 And so the famine continued, and eventually things

653
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,180
 got so bad that the Jerusalem wall,

654
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,140
 somebody started chipping away at it

655
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,780
 to get out of the city.

656
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,140
 And they left at night, like Shawshank Redemption,

657
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,900
 where you're like going against the wall, building up.

658
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,860
 And they left at night, and the king went with them.

659
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,460
 He abandoned his city, and he snuck out with this group.

660
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,700
 And here's what happened.

661
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,300
 But the Babylonian army pursued the king,

662
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,420
 and overtook him in the plains of Jericho.

663
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,420
 All the soldiers were separated from him,

664
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,140
 and scattered, and he was captured.

665
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,580
 So Zedekiah runs away, and they grab him,

666
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,500
 and they bring him back.

667
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,580
 He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah,

668
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,300
 which is just a city where sentence was pronounced.

669
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,220
 So he's taken to Nebuchadnezzar,

670
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
 and he's standing before this emperor.

671
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,460
 And here's what they do.

672
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,940
 They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes.

673
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,820
 And then they put out his own eyes,

674
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
 and bound him with bronze shackles,

675
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,020
 and took him to Babylon.

676
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,700
 That they slaughtered, and the last thing he would ever see

677
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,640
 was his children being slaughtered.

678
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,060
 And then they poked out his eyes,

679
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,340
 and they led him back to Babylon,

680
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,340
 because he refused to obey, to surrender,

681
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,300
 to accept that rebellion, you rebel against God's word,

682
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,380
 it always brings pain.

683
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,700
 And he sent messenger after messenger,

684
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,640
 listen to me, please, don't do this.

685
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,820
 And Zedekiah, and Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin

686
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,780
 did the same thing.

687
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,540
 I don't care what God says, I'm gonna do it my way.

688
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,820
 And God says to all of us who step outside

689
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,920
 of his commands, or who rebel against him,

690
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,980
 please, you will suffer for this.

691
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,060
 Surrender, submit to my word and to my ways.

692
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,740
 I want you to surrender, and in doing so,

693
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,980
 you'll surrender to life.

694
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,140
 But if you don't, you will suffer for it,

695
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,900
 you may even die for it, will you surrender?

696
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,340
 And then they did this, they went back,

697
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,700
 so they killed the sons and the family,

698
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,980
 and then they went back, verse nine,

699
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,180
 King Nebuchadnezzar set fire to the temple of the Lord.

700
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,640
 Set fire to the royal palace,

701
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,560
 and all of the houses of Jerusalem,

702
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,420
 every important building, they burned down.

703
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,160
 The whole Babylonian army broke down the walls

704
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,340
 around Jerusalem, they tore down everything.

705
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,720
 The temple would be no more.

706
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,520
 All of Solomon's wonders that he had built were gone.

707
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,040
 And there would be no more kings in Judah.

708
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,180
 And Jeremiah was set free from that prison,

709
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,700
 and he's thinking, why?

710
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,380
 Why would you refuse to obey?

711
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,680
 We got sent these messages, I want life for you,

712
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,960
 I love you Israel, I love you Judah,

713
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,460
 I love you king, will you repent,

714
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,460
 will you turn back to me and obey my words?

715
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,160
 Because they will come true.

716
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,100
 And yet they refused to listen.

717
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,720
 I think it's like, crazy as that story is,

718
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
 here's kind of the takeaway I think for us.

719
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,760
 When you look at why that could be in scripture,

720
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,040
 like why, God doesn't just record this story,

721
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,320
 he records it thoroughly.

722
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,800
 I mean, the whole book of Jeremiah, Lamentations,

723
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,680
 Ezekiel's first half, in 2 Chronicles and 2 Kings,

724
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,640
 all of them, they talk about this story,

725
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,980
 that's all Jeremiah's even about, and Lamentations.

726
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,240
 Why is God going, I want you to make sure

727
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,000
 that you know about this?

728
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,200
 And here's why I think it is,

729
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,080
 because all of us have a little bit of the king,

730
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,460
 Zedekiah and those three kings in us.

731
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,240
 Well, I don't think rebellion's gonna bring that much pain.

732
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
 I wanna do things my way.

733
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,000
 And God says, I love you Israel, I love you David,

734
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I love you porch, will you surrender to my ways?

735
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,640
 And he goes to great lengths to make sure that you know,

736
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,080
 don't miss this story, it's not that I'm angry

737
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
 or trying to pay them back,

738
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,820
 I'm trying to bring them back to me,

739
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,840
 because I love them.

740
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,660
 And he loves you, and he wants you to surrender to life.

741
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,040
 And if you're in the room and you're running,

742
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,080
 and you know you've been running,

743
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,840
 God stands outside the city like Nebuchadnezzar

744
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,140
 around those walls and he says,

745
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,940
 surrender, you can't win this fight, will you surrender?

746
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,200
 I'm not angry at you trying to surrender to death

747
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,000
 and rip you off, I want you to surrender to life.

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,840
 I love you.

749
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,120
 And you know how I know that's true?

750
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,040
 Not just because you've repeatedly sent messengers,

751
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,960
 please, tell them to surrender.

752
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,080
 But because a few hundred yards

753
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,800
 from where all of this took place,

754
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,280
 a few hundred yards from where all of this took place,

755
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,680
 outside of those walls that were broken down,

756
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,200
 a few hundred years later, Jesus, God and human flesh

757
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,440
 would show up and die on a cross to show that God says,

758
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,560
 I will pay any price to bring my children back,

759
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,360
 including the life of my son.

760
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,040
 Will they surrender to me?

761
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,720
 Will you surrender?

762
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,420
 Because all of us just have things that eventually we go,

763
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,080
 I'm just gonna try it my way.

764
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,040
 And God stands outside the gate saying,

765
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,920
 disaster will come apart from me.

766
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,200
 We surrender to life.

767
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
 And so I don't know what that looks like,

768
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
 I think the application for all of us

769
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
 is just surrendering and submitting to God's word

770
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,120
 is always the best option.

771
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
 And you may be going, yeah, duh.

772
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,300
 But here's where I think that hits a lot of us in the room.

773
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,480
 Some of you guys need to break up with your boyfriend,

774
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,120
 or break up with your girlfriend.

775
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,640
 And you're going, no, it's not that bad,

776
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,560
 or I mean, he's a really good guy.

777
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,500
 And God says, look, I am ringing the bell.

778
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,720
 I'm trying to get you to surrender to life.

779
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,260
 Some of you guys need to move out.

780
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,560
 You're living together and you know it's wrong.

781
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,440
 And you're going, yeah, but it's financially,

782
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,600
 you know, it's going well.

783
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,560
 We will help you get finances worked out

784
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
 if you are a part of this body.

785
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,840
 And if you're not, whatever body you're a part of

786
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,160
 will help you, I hope.

787
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,060
 And if not, you may look at find another one,

788
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,920
 or at least find a church body.

789
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,240
 If you are addicted to Percocet,

790
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,760
 and you're going, look, but my doctor says everything's fine

791
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,520
 or whatever the prescription medicine.

792
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,220
 And you know, God sits outside the walls

793
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,820
 and he says, we surrender.

794
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,320
 And in doing so, you surrender to life.

795
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,280
 Some of you may need to give up alcohol.

796
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,240
 Not 'cause alcohol is inherently wrong,

797
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,140
 but when alcohol gets a hold of you, it's wrong.

798
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,360
 And you just make decisions.

799
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,960
 And God who loves you says, will you surrender?

800
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,840
 Some of you need to delete phone numbers

801
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,480
 of friends tonight who are pulling you down.

802
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
 And you need to wave the white flag and say,

803
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,560
 God, I'm coming in with my hands up, I surrender.

804
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,960
 And you need to go to community group.

805
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,560
 I don't know where it hits all of us,

806
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,400
 but there's parts of us where the rebellion in our hearts,

807
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,480
 and you know if you're running.

808
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,020
 And God says, you cannot outrun me.

809
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,340
 You can run from me, but you will not outrun me

810
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,540
 because I love you.

811
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
 Will you surrender to life?

812
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:04,240
 Some of you need to get rid of a computer

813
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,120
 or an iPad or internet that's pulling you

814
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,920
 in a direction and a porn addiction.

815
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,040
 And you may not say, it's not really an addiction,

816
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,840
 but it has a hold on your life.

817
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,520
 And so I don't know what it is for all of us in the room.

818
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:28,000
 I, in college, one of the more exciting days

819
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,060
 that I had was coming home from a class.

820
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,040
 And it was, I rode my bike to class

821
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,880
 and then I rode it home.

822
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,640
 And I lived in a house that was near campus

823
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,800
 in College Station.

824
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,140
 And there was seven,

825
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,560
 and there was seven other roommates that I have.

826
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,000
 So all these guys in this one house.

827
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,160
 So I ride home and I get to my,

828
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,560
 and I'm parking my bike in the backyard.

829
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,240
 And all of a sudden I see there's police officers

830
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,760
 in my backyard and in my neighbors.

831
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, those parking tickets

832
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
 really came back to bite me.

833
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,760
 And it wasn't that.

834
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,240
 And so he comes up and says,

835
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,880
 hey, you gotta go in your house.

836
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,480
 And so I'm going, what's going on out here?

837
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,200
 And so I go up in my house with my roommates

838
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,920
 and we're looking out the back window

839
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,200
 of the back of our house into our neighbor's yard.

840
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,400
 We don't have a fence.

841
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,240
 And we're looking out there and come to find out

842
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,120
 a guy had broken in to the house behind us.

843
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,680
 And he had tried to steal a TV

844
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,080
 and a neighbor saw him, so they called the cops.

845
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,440
 And so we're like sitting there watching this.

846
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,720
 Like this is entertaining and exciting.

847
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,560
 There's police everywhere surrounding the building.

848
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,880
 They're Kevlar vests.

849
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,240
 I mean, we're watching it.

850
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,560
 And here's what hits us.

851
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,160
 We know this is ending one of two ways.

852
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,720
 I mean, none of the options end with this guy

853
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,640
 just kind of strolling out of there scotch free.

854
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,840
 It ends in one of two ways.

855
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,920
 Either he will choose to surrender

856
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
 or he will be forced to surrender.

857
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,800
 'Cause whatever little revolver he has in there,

858
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,840
 he had a gun, won't stand much of a chance

859
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,240
 to the SWAT team that showed up

860
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 and is totally surrounding the building.

861
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,960
 And so we wait a little bit and then all of a sudden

862
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,680
 the police break down the door

863
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,520
 and he went with option number two, forced.

864
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,040
 And he fired at 'em.

865
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,280
 And nobody was hit or he wasn't injured.

866
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,320
 But they fired back and he got shot in the leg.

867
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,560
 And now he left with charges,

868
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,120
 not just for trying to steal a TV,

869
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,520
 but for shooting at a police officer.

870
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,480
 And was forced into surrender.

871
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,280
 And for all of us, like the messages of scriptures,

872
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,480
 and this may come across scary

873
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 and I don't want it to come across any more scary

874
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,240
 than it maybe should be, as God tells us.

875
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,640
 Turn and surrender to life.

876
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,200
 Or will one day either be forced to surrender

877
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,040
 or will choose today.

878
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,160
 And so will you choose to surrender,

879
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,840
 whatever that is for you.

880
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,640
 And I know you're sitting there and you're going,

881
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,040
 ah, yeah, that's not really me, I'm not gonna.

882
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,120
 There will come a day

883
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,040
 and you'll either carry more scars and baggage

884
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 if it's down the road or if you surrender today.

885
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
 And so will you choose today.

886
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,560
 God who loves you says, choose him, surrender to life.

887
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,440
 I'm gonna pray.

888
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,960
 Oh, Father, thank you for the stories of these three men.

889
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,960
 Thank you for just your grace in the midst of our rebellion.

890
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,360
 That you send us your messengers,

891
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,360
 you send us your word and you offer us life.

892
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
 I pray that we would respond to that.

893
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,800
 I pray for my friends in the room

894
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,080
 who know they need to surrender.

895
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,960
 Would they choose and surrender to you?

896
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,760
 Pray that even now as just the chaos that rebellion

897
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,120
 and sin bring into our life and consequences

898
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,280
 that it just brings.

899
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,880
 As those feel overwhelming,

900
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,560
 that your hand would be heavy,

901
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,720
 not to make them feel like they owe you anything,

902
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
 but so that they would surrender to you

903
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,080
 who they do owe everything.

904
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,840
 Through Jesus, thank you that you showed us

905
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,880
 how much you love us.

906
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,520
 We love you, amen.

907
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,520
 (silence)

908
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:15,520
