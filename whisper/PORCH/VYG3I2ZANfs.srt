00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:27,160
 What's up, Forge?

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,720
 How we doing?

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,920
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,880
 If we haven't met, my name is Jonathan Picluda.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,400
 It is a privilege to be with you here tonight

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,200
 to teach from God's word.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,720
 And man, yesterday I was online and was just kind of--

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,200
 there was an article that caught my eye.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,040
 It was this-- 15 things you're doing wrong.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
 That's clickbait, right?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
 15 things you're doing wrong.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,680
 That's like, hey, click on me and waste

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,360
 seven minutes of your life so that you can see what somebody--

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,000
 but you know, so what did I do?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
 I clicked on it and wasted seven minutes of my life.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,840
 And so it was these 15 things.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,400
 And it was actually pretty interesting and fairly

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 compelling.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,960
 And so it just started out a little bit lame.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,800
 It was talking about like pronunciation.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,280
 OK?

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,960
 So these 15 things we're doing wrong, one was pronunciation.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
 And so it gave some specific examples of words.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,040
 This didn't surprise me.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,800
 I know there's words we pronounce wrong.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,920
 But here was one of them, for example.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,400
 OK?

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,800
 So what word is that?

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,360
 OK.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,080
 Sure bet.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,680
 Sure bet.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,120
 There's no R here.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,360
 OK?

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,520
 So the right way to say that word is sure bet,

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,880
 like your English.

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,960
 Sure bet.

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,480
 And so yeah, it was interesting.

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,760
 I always say sherbert.

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,960
 You know, give me the rainbow sherbert.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,040
 But it's sure bet.

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
 So now you know.

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,440
 Here was another word.

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,280
 What is this word?

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
 You all got that one wrong.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,000
 OK?

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,480
 It's brew skedda.

48
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
 Brew skedda.

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,560
 OK, you got it right.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,480
 Everyone else got it wrong.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,560
 Brew skedda, not brew shedda, which I've always said.

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
 So you have been ordering your appetizers

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,560
 at Italian restaurants wrong all your life.

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
 And now you know.

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
 And so here was another one they said.

56
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,360
 What is this word?

57
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,640
 All right, let's solve this mystery right now.

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
 I don't want it to go any further.

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
 We're done with this right now.

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,480
 If you think it's gif, raise your hand.

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,920
 Gif.

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,240
 OK, some of you are just real sure.

63
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,760
 I hear you.

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,520
 You're angry.

65
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
 Stop it.

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
 OK, if you think it's gif, raise your hand.

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,280
 OK, if you just kind of glized over it real fast

68
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,120
 because you don't know what it is, raise your hand.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
 OK.

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,360
 It is.

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
 Are you ready?

72
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,880
 Drum roll, please.

73
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,760
 It's gif.

74
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
 Gif.

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,680
 Gif.

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
 Oh no, I see you saying I'm wrong.

77
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,600
 Shaking your head.

78
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
 You're wrong.

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,760
 OK, this was a question on Jeopardy.

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,520
 And they went back to the founder of the word.

81
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,880
 And he said it's gif.

82
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,320
 So now we know everyone for the rest of your life

83
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,440
 can say that word correctly.

84
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
 All right, so this is just how the article starts.

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,040
 We're still on the first one.

86
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,400
 It was pronunciation.

87
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,920
 I'm not going to tell you, just go into detail

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,360
 on the other ones.

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,480
 But here's what they were.

90
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
 Ready?

91
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,520
 Breathing.

92
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
 I'm like, I'm breathing wrong.

93
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,640
 Are you serious?

94
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,880
 Showering, working out, going to the bathroom,

95
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,240
 washing hands, sleeping, eating, brushing your teeth,

96
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
 and shaving.

97
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 There were several.

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 There were 15 of them.

99
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,200
 Those are some of them.

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,520
 All of these things you're doing wrong.

101
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,400
 And as I was reading it yesterday,

102
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,560
 I was thinking about, you know, there's

103
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,360
 something that I'm certain we're doing wrong

104
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,480
 that didn't make the list.

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
 And the article went on to talk about some

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,000
 of the consequences to doing these things wrong,

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 like sleeping, and eating, and breathing,

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
 have real physical consequences.

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,320
 But this particular thing that didn't make the list, I think,

110
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,960
 has one of the greatest consequences,

111
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
 most relevant to us.

112
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,560
 And so we're in this series, Asking for a Friend,

113
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,080
 questions you wish the church would answer.

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,580
 And tonight, we're going to look at,

115
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,040
 what does the Bible have to say about sex?

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,440
 What does it actually have to say about sex?

117
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,280
 You've probably heard some murmurings here and there.

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
 But what does it actually have to say about sex?

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,000
 And even more specifically, sex before marriage.

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,400
 And so as I said, that I think this

121
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,360
 is the thing that is going to be, or cause,

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
 some of the greatest regrets in our lives.

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,200
 So let's just say, fast forward the tape to when you're 40,

124
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
 45.

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
 And let me just say this from personal experience.

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
 This is the thing that has caused the greatest regrets

127
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
 in my own life.

128
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,160
 This has had a bigger impact on my own marriage than anything.

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
 So just in case you're a guest with us,

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
 and you're like, oh, great, another pastor telling me

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,200
 I can't have sex before I'm married.

132
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
 What does he know?

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
 I'm sure he's saving himself.

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
 No.

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,600
 I have a scandalous past.

136
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,240
 Sexual addiction is a huge part of my story.

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
 Pornography, tremendous part of my story.

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 And so I've traveled and have the privilege and the honor

139
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,680
 of speaking on this topic in a lot of different places.

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
 And I'm really grateful to be home tonight

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,320
 to talk with you about it.

142
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
 And it's not something that I'm just--

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
 I'm not trying to scare you.

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
 I'm not putting things up here just to kind of condemn you.

145
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,040
 I don't want you to leave feeling guilty or full of shame.

146
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
 I want you to know that I found forgiveness,

147
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
 the same forgiveness that is available to you.

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,200
 And there's tremendous hope.

149
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,680
 And the scripture is really clear.

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,320
 And so I'm not trying to pull anything over your eyes.

151
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,720
 I want to show you what God's word has to say.

152
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,520
 Because the way you find out how to pronounce jif

153
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
 is you go to the creator.

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,320
 And the way that you find out how to have sex

155
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,440
 is you go to the inventor, the creator of sex.

156
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,360
 You can go into the grocery store,

157
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,680
 to the tabloids in the aisle, and there'll

158
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,400
 be a lot of people that will tell you 13 tips and tricks

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,240
 to how to have an amazing sex life.

160
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,160
 And they've dumbed it down to penetration.

161
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
 They've dumbed it down to something

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,440
 that dogs do on the side of the road.

163
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,760
 And the creator of the heavens and the Earth

164
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,920
 has said it's so much more.

165
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,160
 And you're missing out on it if you would just

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,680
 look at why he created this.

167
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,000
 God loves sex.

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
 It's his brainchild.

169
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,160
 He thought of it.

170
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,280
 He invented it.

171
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
 I've said it many times.

172
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
 He made the parts.

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,040
 He made them function the way that they do,

174
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,000
 fit together the way that they do,

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,280
 that a man would take his seed and place it inside a woman,

176
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,000
 and life would be born.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,400
 This is beautiful and amazing and one of the greatest

178
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,360
 miracles of our lives.

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,160
 But we don't think about it that way.

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,320
 Most of the time when we're thinking about sex,

181
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,560
 we're thinking about pleasure and really stripping away

182
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,720
 what we would call the consequences.

183
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
 How do we enjoy a moment of pleasure?

184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,480
 And this is something that I think we've come so far on

185
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,520
 that I need you to have an open mind tonight

186
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,840
 and start from the place like what if we've gotten this

187
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,200
 really, really, really wrong?

188
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,640
 And what if the consequences are so grave that we're just

189
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,920
 swimming in them and we don't even realize it?

190
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,200
 Like they have tremendous impact on the world

191
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,240
 that we live in and we don't even realize it.

192
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,560
 And so we're gonna look at three questions tonight.

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,120
 The first one is what does the Bible really say about sex

194
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,940
 and why it's wrong and why isn't it more obvious?

195
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,960
 The second one is how far is too far?

196
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,720
 And then before you leave here this morning,

197
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
 I wanna address the question what do I do

198
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
 if I've already gone too far?

199
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,840
 And the temptation I face is just to give up

200
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,720
 and to say hey, who cares, let's just go all in.

201
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
 And so the first question is this,

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,320
 where does the Bible explicitly say

203
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,640
 that sex before marriage is wrong?

204
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,000
 Let me tell you a story.

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,040
 I was one of these kids,

206
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,160
 and I'm sure you've heard about these boys.

207
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,640
 I was one of these boys that I went to a Bible study.

208
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
 It was actually at my girlfriend's house,

209
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,640
 my girlfriend's parents' house, okay, in high school.

210
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,540
 My girlfriend in high school's parents' house.

211
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,660
 So you got the setting.

212
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,800
 We're sitting there in the living room.

213
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,520
 There's a Bible school teacher

214
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
 and they're talking about this

215
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,920
 and then telling us how we shouldn't have sex.

216
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,440
 And I just kind of raised my hand and said hey,

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
 I've read the Bible.

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
 It's not in there.

219
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,740
 It doesn't say don't have sex before marriage.

220
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,520
 And you can't show me, and there's some things going on,

221
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,680
 and you don't understand the Greek word

222
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,720
 that I've looked into,

223
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,680
 because every boy who wants to get his girlfriend naked

224
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,120
 all of a sudden becomes a Greek scholar, okay?

225
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
 That's just kind of how that works.

226
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160
 And so I'm like hey, listen,

227
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,800
 now this is, keep in mind where I'm at.

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
 And so my girlfriend's dad walks in

229
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,360
 and he's like wait, who's asking this question

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
 and what's he saying?

231
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,720
 And I'm like I don't know, who is?

232
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,640
 Which one?

233
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
 And he's like that dude is not going

234
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,920
 anywhere near my daughter.

235
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
 And but here's what you need to know.

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
 I was wrong.

237
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,120
 And if that's you here tonight,

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,380
 I empathize with your stance.

239
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,220
 I understand why you're there.

240
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,260
 You're trying to justify what you want to do.

241
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,120
 And you're also wrong.

242
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,320
 And so we'll get to look at what God's word actually says,

243
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,920
 because the first thing Satan says,

244
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
 one of the first things Satan says to humanity is this.

245
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,340
 Did God really say?

246
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,960
 Did God really say?

247
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,320
 And if you're one of those people,

248
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,960
 as it comes to sex, you're saying did God really say?

249
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
 Here's what you need to know.

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,360
 You're getting duped by the enemy.

251
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,500
 He's eating your lunch.

252
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,040
 You're getting sold by Satan.

253
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,160
 You are believing his lie

254
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,600
 and he is getting the best of you.

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
 And so let's just walk through the Bible

256
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,920
 and kind of talk about different areas

257
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,360
 that talk about different kinds of sex really quick.

258
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,720
 And so the first one is the Old Testament, right?

259
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,880
 The Old Testament is about 75% of the Bible.

260
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,520
 And as we get to the first five books,

261
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,800
 it has a lot to do, a lot to say about sex.

262
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,840
 You have the invention of man and woman

263
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,520
 right at the beginning.

264
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,400
 And God says, "Be fruitful and multiply,

265
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
 "fill the earth and subdue it."

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,640
 And so here, it says this in Deuteronomy chapter 22.

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,840
 The context of this verse is that if someone gets married

268
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
 and someone raises the point

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,260
 that who he married was not a virgin,

270
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,440
 then he has to prove that she was a virgin.

271
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,300
 And the way that he would prove that she was a virgin

272
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,640
 is he would have to present the bedsheet

273
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,060
 from their honeymoon and have to show

274
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,800
 that there was blood on the bedsheet

275
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,080
 from their honeymoon to prove that she was a virgin.

276
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,180
 I know that's graphic.

277
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,900
 If you have kids here tonight,

278
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,760
 we typically don't let children in the porch.

279
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,800
 (congregation laughing)

280
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
 And so just know that I'm speaking to adults tonight.

281
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,280
 And so I know that's really graphic.

282
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,360
 This is Deuteronomy chapter 22, verse 13.

283
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,960
 It says, I'm sorry, verse 20.

284
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,080
 It says, "If, however, the charge is true

285
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,200
 "and no proof of the young woman's virginity can be found,

286
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,140
 "she shall be brought to the door of her father's house

287
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,640
 "and there the men of her town shall stone her to death."

288
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,660
 Ouch, okay, that's crazy.

289
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,340
 That's crazy.

290
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,060
 Here's what I just said.

291
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,000
 If someone gets married and someone raises the case,

292
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,880
 hey, that they're not a virgin,

293
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,940
 they literally had the right, according to the Bible,

294
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,940
 according to the law of that time, to kill them by rocks.

295
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,700
 This is really graphic and really heavy,

296
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,460
 but you need to know this is how the Bible starts out,

297
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,540
 that God really, really cares about this.

298
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,900
 Now, I know where your mind's going,

299
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,460
 a thousand different places,

300
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,700
 and you're like, what about the guy?

301
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,740
 Here's what it says about the guy in Exodus chapter 22.

302
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,500
 It says that if he has sex with a girl,

303
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,400
 if he convinces a girl to have sex with him,

304
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,060
 then they are married and they cannot get divorced.

305
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,900
 I'm not talking about married in God's eyes.

306
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,100
 I'm talking about they are married,

307
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,580
 he can't marry anyone else,

308
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,900
 and they have to stay married forever.

309
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,460
 And he has to pay to be married to her.

310
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,100
 He has to pay her father a dowry.

311
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,440
 And so this is how the Scripture just kinda starts out,

312
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,100
 saying, hey, sex is a really, really big deal,

313
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,380
 and you're like, man, this is crazy.

314
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
 Keep in mind a couple things.

315
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,260
 One, that was written 3,000 years ago

316
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,780
 into a cultural context very different

317
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,700
 than the one that we live in.

318
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,460
 In this cultural context,

319
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,500
 sex was held in the highest regard,

320
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,540
 and purity wasn't even something you'd question.

321
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,580
 Like, everyone, no one would wonder,

322
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,180
 can I have sex before I'm married or not?

323
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,780
 No way, you might, you would die.

324
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,300
 It would cost you your life.

325
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,060
 No one's even thinking about that, okay?

326
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,780
 And you say, man, but that's still crazy.

327
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,940
 Let me tell you a story from my hometown.

328
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,300
 In my hometown, a dad, a father,

329
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,300
 walked up on a man having sex with his underage daughter.

330
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,580
 True story.

331
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,740
 And that dad beat that man to death.

332
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,380
 He killed him.

333
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,220
 Right there on the spot.

334
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,300
 He appeared before the judge,

335
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,780
 and the judge, in a matter of minutes, let him off.

336
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,260
 Said, you're free.

337
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,340
 I hold nothing against you.

338
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,660
 You've committed no crime here.

339
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,940
 I understand why you did what you did.

340
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,820
 And I remember reading that article and thinking, yeah.

341
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,780
 I mean, we're human beings.

342
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,180
 He's filled with passion and rage.

343
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,620
 He sees this happening.

344
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,460
 Of course.

345
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,260
 Now consider that every young lady

346
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,020
 that has ever been born and created

347
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,380
 is the creation of God.

348
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,460
 Like, God brought her into existence

349
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,180
 and formed her body and knows everything about her

350
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,220
 and loves her more than her father does.

351
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,580
 And when you take advantage of that girl, men,

352
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,660
 the scripture, 1 Thessalonians 4 says,

353
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,180
 God is the avenger of these matters.

354
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,100
 That it really, really matters to him.

355
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,420
 And I'm not trying to scare you.

356
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,180
 I'm just reading the scripture to you.

357
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,300
 And so you're like, but wait, okay.

358
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,340
 I thought we were talking about sex being wrong.

359
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,660
 The Old Testament, like,

360
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,780
 we don't follow the Old Testament, right?

361
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,860
 We eat shellfish and pork.

362
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,260
 And so we're not following those rules.

363
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,700
 And I've heard something about, you know,

364
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,340
 there being moral laws and ceremonial laws.

365
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,220
 And so what does this mean?

366
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,140
 How does this matter?

367
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,380
 Well, let's move to the New Testament,

368
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,460
 but let's agree that 75% of the Bible

369
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,380
 says sex before marriage is explicitly wrong.

370
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,180
 75%, that's the Old Testament.

371
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,940
 75% of the Bible's like, oh yeah, absolutely.

372
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,300
 You could get killed for doing that.

373
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,980
 Okay, so let's move into the New Testament.

374
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,420
 And let's just look at different kinds of sex.

375
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,620
 We'll start with sex with prostitutes.

376
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,740
 Can I have sex with prostitutes?

377
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,260
 First Corinthians six, verse 14.

378
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,220
 Do you not know that your bodies

379
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,700
 are members of Christ himself?

380
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,140
 Shall I then take members of Christ

381
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,740
 and unite them with a prostitute?

382
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,420
 Never, okay?

383
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,860
 So I can't have sex with prostitutes, all right?

384
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,980
 That is out.

385
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
 Old Testament, out.

386
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,340
 Sex with prostitutes, also out.

387
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,420
 That is not allowed.

388
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,780
 And you say, well, why does that matter?

389
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,620
 Here's why it matters.

390
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,420
 Because there's only certain labels

391
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,620
 that girls carried in the New Testament.

392
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,580
 So when you think about categories,

393
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,900
 there is no girlfriend category.

394
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
 It did not exist in the New Testament.

395
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,220
 You had mom, sister, adulterer, prostitute, or wife.

396
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,500
 Those were the labels that you'd have.

397
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,140
 You could be a relative.

398
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,540
 You could be an adulterer.

399
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,520
 You could be a prostitute.

400
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,500
 Or you could be a wife.

401
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,020
 There was no girlfriend.

402
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,500
 There was no dating category.

403
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,820
 And so let's talk about something

404
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,240
 that you know the Bible condemns.

405
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,460
 It's adultery.

406
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,700
 We'll talk about adultery.

407
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,780
 It's married people.

408
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,600
 This is having sex with a married person

409
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,260
 or going outside of your marriage to have sex.

410
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,940
 In Romans 7, verse three says,

411
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,620
 so then if she has sexual relations with another man

412
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,220
 while her husband is still alive,

413
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,900
 she is called an adulteress.

414
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,340
 But if her husband dies, she is released from that law

415
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,460
 and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.

416
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,660
 And so the Bible says you cannot go outside

417
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,060
 of your marriage to have sex,

418
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,580
 and you cannot have sex with someone

419
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,620
 who is married to someone else.

420
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,580
 And we say, absolutely, we know that.

421
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,900
 The Bible's really explicit about this.

422
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
 In the New Testament, it says this seven times,

423
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,100
 that you cannot do this.

424
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,740
 This is condemned seven times in the New Testament.

425
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,720
 When something's important, it's repeated in the Scripture.

426
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,260
 And so we see that this is wrong.

427
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,180
 It's like God is saying something.

428
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,020
 He's saying, hey, marriage is a really sacred fence,

429
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,340
 and sex is for marriage.

430
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,500
 And you can't go outside of that marriage

431
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,340
 to have sex with anyone else, okay?

432
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,780
 You don't wanna have sex with anyone

433
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,260
 who's in that fence with somebody else.

434
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,420
 And he's about to tell us, and you don't have sex

435
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,200
 before you get in that fence.

436
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,700
 You say, where?

437
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,760
 Before I go there, Hebrews 13, four,

438
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,700
 just this idea that marriage is a sacred fence.

439
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,380
 Marriage should be honored by all,

440
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,620
 and the marriage bed kept pure,

441
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,860
 for God will judge the adulterer and the sexually immoral.

442
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,520
 There's two terms there, adulterer,

443
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,420
 and then another term, the sexually immoral.

444
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,080
 This word is really important

445
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,700
 in understanding what the Scripture says.

446
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,180
 So let's talk about sexual immorality.

447
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,660
 First Thessalonians chapter four, verses three through five

448
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,740
 says, it is God's will that you should be sanctified,

449
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,060
 that you should avoid sexual immorality,

450
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,940
 that each of you should learn to control your own body

451
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,140
 in a way that is holy and honorable,

452
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,660
 not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God.

453
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,960
 And so whatever sexual immorality is, it is forbidden.

454
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,520
 And it says that we're to learn to control our own body.

455
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,040
 And so here is a word that encompasses

456
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,680
 sex before marriage, okay?

457
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
 And you say, well, why doesn't it say sex before marriage?

458
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,160
 Keep in mind the context that it's written in

459
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,000
 is that people aren't, they know,

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,800
 they know that you can't have sex before marriage.

461
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,560
 Remember the woman who was caught in sexual sin

462
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,080
 in John chapter eight?

463
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,940
 They come around her and they pick up rocks

464
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,080
 and they're about to kill her right there.

465
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,900
 And Jesus intervenes.

466
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,440
 That's them living out the law in Deuteronomy 22.

467
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,720
 This is the context that this is written in.

468
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,920
 And so everybody comes up,

469
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,480
 this is where you become a Greek scholar,

470
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,280
 say, well, that's the word porneia.

471
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,960
 And porneia can mean, you know,

472
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
 all of these different things.

473
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,200
 No, porneia means any sexual activity

474
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,600
 outside of the context of a man and a woman

475
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,560
 who are married together.

476
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,120
 That's what porneia means.

477
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,400
 You can look up the definition anywhere you want.

478
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,280
 It's like, well, how do you know what it means?

479
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,440
 How do I know what up means?

480
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,840
 How do I know what down means?

481
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,560
 How do I know what any word means?

482
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,600
 I can look it up and we know without a doubt,

483
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,560
 without any question, what porneia means.

484
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,760
 Sex outside of God's covenant of marriage.

485
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,960
 Sexual activity.

486
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,500
 Any kind of sex.

487
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
 And so the problem is we all wanna decide

488
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
 what this word means.

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,460
 And we all agree that there's some forbidden sex.

490
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,320
 Right, like I'm just gonna go on a limb

491
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,360
 and I'm gonna assume that everyone here

492
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
 would say like sex with children, that's wrong.

493
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,980
 That's forbidden.

494
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,200
 Let's just assume we all agree that that's wrong.

495
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,920
 But you know there's people that don't agree with you,

496
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,000
 right, there's NAMBLA,

497
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 which stands for North American Men Boy Love Association.

498
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,360
 And it's as outrageous as it sounds.

499
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,080
 And they advocate pedophilia.

500
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,860
 They say that it should be legal, right.

501
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,800
 But we would say no, that's forbidden.

502
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 Why would you say that?

503
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,960
 Where does that come from?

504
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,120
 Well, just a feeling I have.

505
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,480
 Or we could listen to the one who created sex

506
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,760
 and says this is what sex is for.

507
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,720
 We don't get to decide what is right and what is wrong.

508
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,240
 He does and he's made it really clear.

509
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,140
 Remember I said adultery was condemned seven times?

510
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,040
 Pornia, fornication is translated in some Bibles,

511
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,660
 which is a more direct sex before marriage,

512
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,040
 is condemned 26 times in the New Testament.

513
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,900
 26 times.

514
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,360
 And so you think, but why does God say,

515
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,600
 why does he not say thou shalt not have sex before marriage?

516
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
 It's like this.

517
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,960
 It's like God says, there's a building,

518
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,100
 and God says, hey, don't go on the roof.

519
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,400
 Under any circumstance, don't go on the roof.

520
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
 That's this word, pornia.

521
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,680
 It's all encompassing.

522
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,800
 It's all kinds of sexual immorality,

523
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,320
 which includes sex before marriage.

524
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,900
 And God says, don't go on the roof.

525
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,580
 Whatever you do, don't go on the roof.

526
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,240
 Let me tell you 26 times,

527
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,880
 do not under any circumstance go on the roof.

528
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,600
 And we show up and we say,

529
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,840
 well, God didn't say don't jump off the roof.

530
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,960
 Why did he never say don't jump off the roof?

531
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,840
 He's like, no, no, no, you don't say,

532
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
 he put the line way before that.

533
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
 He said, don't even go up on the roof.

534
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
 I'm like, yeah, but he never said don't jump off the roof.

535
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,240
 Did he, really?

536
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,000
 I mean, where, 'cause it's a Greek word.

537
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,360
 It's like God, it's like God didn't say

538
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
 don't shoot someone at point blank range

539
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,160
 16 times in the chest with an AR-15 .223 caliber.

540
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,440
 Where did he say that?

541
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,400
 Well, he said, don't murder.

542
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean, but where does he say?

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,320
 No, no, his rule is even bigger than that.

544
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,760
 But does it include absolutely right in the middle of that?

545
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,840
 Of course, it includes that.

546
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,720
 And you say, well, I'm not convinced, 1 Corinthians 7, 2,

547
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,720
 but since sexual immorality is occurring,

548
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,320
 the only thing I know to do is that each man

549
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,480
 should have sexual relations with his own wife

550
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,920
 and each woman with her own husband.

551
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,220
 This is the only place that this should occur.

552
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,600
 And so the only solution to sexual immorality

553
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 is abstinence or marriage if someone's seeking release.

554
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,040
 And you say, well, I'm not convinced yet.

555
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,480
 And so let's just go one more.

556
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,820
 We got the topic of lust.

557
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,880
 Lust in Matthew 5, this is the words of Jesus now.

558
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,560
 He says, you have heard it was said,

559
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
 you shall not commit adultery,

560
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,600
 but I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully

561
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,340
 has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

562
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,340
 And so Jesus says, hey, I know you've heard adultery

563
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,780
 condemned, but I'm condemning you looking at someone

564
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,920
 and desiring her.

565
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,600
 Lust is sexual desire, and that's what this is.

566
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 And so he says, that's not, even that,

567
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
 even to have sexual desire for someone

568
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,440
 that you're not married to, that is not allowed.

569
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,240
 And you say, well, that's not a reality, right?

570
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,280
 That's not anything that I can do.

571
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,080
 And I would say, you're absolutely right,

572
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,200
 unless the trajectory, the entire trajectory of your life

573
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,840
 and your heart and your mind is to pursue Jesus

574
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,120
 with all you can to love the Lord, your God,

575
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
 with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,

576
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,640
 that that is actually the goal,

577
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,960
 that you're not just trying to not have sex,

578
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,300
 you're trying to love God.

579
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,280
 In fact, your problem is not that you love sex too much,

580
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,440
 it's that you don't love God enough.

581
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,980
 That you, that he would be the biggest thing about you.

582
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,520
 That anybody that you would even think about

583
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,600
 dating or spending time with or desiring to marriage,

584
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,440
 that right at the center of that relationship

585
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,240
 would be Jesus.

586
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,920
 And that anywhere you'd go with her or him

587
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,840
 would be the Holy Spirit.

588
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,860
 And what it would be marked by is not just purity,

589
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
 but holiness.

590
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,980
 That the world would look on and say, man,

591
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,180
 what they have for each other, it's holy.

592
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,460
 It's godly.

593
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,140
 It's God-honoring.

594
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,160
 The Bible says sex is for marriage

595
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,620
 in 1 Corinthians chapter seven, verse nine.

596
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,740
 But if they cannot control themselves,

597
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,600
 they should masturbate.

598
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,680
 Oh no, that's not what it says.

599
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,280
 It says, but if they cannot,

600
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,120
 but if they cannot control themselves,

601
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,680
 they should have oral sex.

602
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,280
 That's not what it says.

603
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,120
 But if they cannot control themselves,

604
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,080
 they should make out.

605
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,240
 That's not what it says.

606
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,540
 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.

607
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,320
 That's really their only option.

608
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,040
 Exclusively their only option.

609
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,260
 For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

610
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,560
 And so we see is sexual activity outside of marriage

611
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,320
 is wrong, that's oral sex, anal sex, sexting,

612
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,640
 any kind of sex that you would have

613
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
 outside of marriage is wrong.

614
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
 And so how far is too far, second question.

615
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040
 How far is too far?

616
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,920
 Let's just acknowledge up front that this question

617
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,560
 is asked by someone wanting to cross the line.

618
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,500
 To cross the line, I mean that we all have a desire

619
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,040
 to go too far.

620
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,060
 That inside of us is an urge to go too far.

621
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,000
 And so if someone comes to me and they say,

622
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,160
 on a building, they say, well how close to the edge

623
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,900
 can I get, how close to the edge of the building can I get?

624
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,540
 The first thing that I'm gonna ask them,

625
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,420
 well let me ask you a question.

626
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,880
 Do you desire to jump off the building?

627
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,540
 Because if you desire to jump off the building,

628
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,200
 stay on the ground.

629
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,560
 Don't even get on the elevator.

630
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,020
 And when it comes to sex, we all need to acknowledge

631
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,280
 that there is a desire in us,

632
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,900
 especially if we're spending time with someone

633
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,380
 that we're attracted to, to jump off the building.

634
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,520
 And so Matthew five goes on to say this,

635
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
 he says, if your right eye causes you to stumble,

636
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
 gouge it out and throw it away,

637
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,720
 it is better for you to lose one part of your body

638
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,440
 than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

639
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
 And if your right hand causes you to stumble,

640
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,340
 cut it off and throw it away.

641
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,520
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body

642
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,680
 than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

643
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,300
 Talking about in the context of lust,

644
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,280
 Jesus is using a hyperbole, an exaggeration.

645
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,240
 He doesn't literally want you to gouge out your eye

646
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
 or cut off your hand, but he is trying to say

647
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,320
 to the religious people there, you need to do

648
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,440
 whatever it takes to abstain from sexual immorality

649
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,160
 and to not lust.

650
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,960
 And it's interesting that when he talks about lust,

651
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,000
 he's saying, hey, your eye causes you to lust

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,840
 because you look at something.

653
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
 And he says, your right hand also causes you to lust.

654
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
 And I believe that is a reference to masturbation.

655
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,320
 And so if you wanna, hey, how far is too far?

656
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,320
 Lusting is too far, masturbation is too far.

657
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,320
 And so let me just break it down very clearly for you.

658
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,880
 Because I know how this works, right?

659
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,680
 Hey, you wanna come over to my apartment

660
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,280
 and watch a movie?

661
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,680
 Sure.

662
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,640
 Is there gonna be popcorn there?

663
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,480
 Yeah, okay.

664
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
 And so you go over and hang out,

665
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
 watch this romantic comedy, you know,

666
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,240
 oh, so funny, it's Jennifer Aniston, I love her.

667
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,920
 And we're just having a good time.

668
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,400
 Hell, I'm tired, I'm gonna, you okay if I lay down?

669
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,720
 Yeah, I'll lay down too.

670
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,080
 Okay, now we just went horizontal.

671
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,040
 Okay, but it's cool 'cause we're just watching a movie.

672
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,400
 Right?

673
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,920
 And then, you know, one hand touches the other hand,

674
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,800
 sparks start flying, move closer, okay?

675
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,360
 Bodies up against each other, there's some rubbing going on.

676
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,760
 Okay, you uncomfortable yet?

677
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,920
 Right?

678
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
 Okay, and then all of a sudden,

679
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,000
 hands start going places, somebody turns over,

680
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,680
 you're making out now, right?

681
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,040
 This is how this goes, right?

682
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,680
 Okay, but we're gonna stop.

683
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,720
 We're just enjoying each other.

684
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
 Here's what you just did.

685
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,760
 You just got on a moving sidewalk.

686
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,520
 You've seen these things in the airport,

687
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,880
 the moving sidewalks?

688
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,440
 You know, you get on 'em, they take you places.

689
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,960
 I got on a moving sidewalk once.

690
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,440
 It was, you know, one that went all the way down

691
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,280
 the terminal.

692
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,640
 I got halfway there with my suitcase, it was full of people,

693
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,480
 and I realized it wasn't the right terminal,

694
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
 wasn't going to the right gate, I needed to get off,

695
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,840
 but it's just slowly moving me down, you know?

696
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,920
 And so I started thinking I'm gonna climb over the side,

697
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,840
 but there was actually two of 'em right beside each other.

698
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
 So I'm thinking, okay, I gotta get them to move,

699
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
 climb over that one, then climb over the next,

700
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,840
 and then somehow, hey, will you hand me my bags?

701
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
 Like, how am I gonna do this?

702
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,600
 Because it's just taking me somewhere, right?

703
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,640
 It just keeps moving me on.

704
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,440
 That's what you did.

705
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,680
 It's leading to two destinations.

706
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,080
 One full of regret, and the other full of regret.

707
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,160
 Right, you either finish,

708
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,520
 or you leave really, really frustrated.

709
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,440
 But it ain't going anywhere good.

710
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,120
 And you stepped on that sidewalk,

711
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,240
 and it just started taking you, right?

712
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,280
 One thing leads to another, and you just keep going.

713
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,680
 So how far is too far?

714
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
 Here's the really clear answer, you ready?

715
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,720
 Really clear, it's transferable, you can tell your friends.

716
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,120
 Here's how far is too far.

717
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,040
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

718
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,360
 you've gone too far.

719
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,480
 Now, do I need to get some,

720
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,800
 I mean, some like, what am I trying to say,

721
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,200
 pictures up here to explain what I mean by this?

722
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,560
 That's not what I was talking about.

723
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,920
 (congregation laughing)

724
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,200
 Let me just say this really clearly.

725
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,480
 When your body, in the way that God designed it to work,

726
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,160
 and operate, and function, and it's an amazing design,

727
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,800
 whether you're male or female, it's an incredible design.

728
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,640
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

729
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,120
 you've already crossed the line.

730
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,720
 And you say, JP, man, gosh,

731
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,080
 then I can't even be in the same room with her.

732
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,660
 Then you can't be in the same room with her,

733
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,720
 at least not alone.

734
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,920
 And for some of you, that's gonna be like,

735
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,200
 well, but then we can't even hold hands.

736
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,600
 Well, then you can't even hold hands.

737
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,360
 Okay, because your body was made to prepare itself for sex.

738
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800
 And that's a great thing.

739
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,320
 Like, that's your body working

740
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,520
 the way that it's supposed to work.

741
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,360
 But why would you start your body only to shut it off

742
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,040
 in a way that it's not supposed to work?

743
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,400
 Why would you train your body to do something

744
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,240
 that it wasn't wired to do, it wasn't meant to do?

745
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,240
 Do you see God's incredibly genius design here?

746
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
 It's an amazing design.

747
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,740
 First Corinthians chapter six, verse 18 says this.

748
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,080
 Flee sexual immorality.

749
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,180
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body.

750
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,760
 But whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.

751
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,520
 Do you not know that your bodies are temple

752
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,480
 of the Holy Spirit who's in you,

753
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,300
 whom you've received from God?

754
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,880
 You are not your own.

755
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
 Therefore, honor God with your body.

756
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,740
 And so we flee sexual immorality.

757
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,240
 The way that we flee sexual immorality

758
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,820
 is we run toward Christ.

759
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,080
 If you're running toward Christ,

760
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,020
 you're running from sexual immorality.

761
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,140
 If you're running toward Christ as fast as you can,

762
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,080
 sexual immorality, I promise you,

763
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,560
 is going to be behind you.

764
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,600
 Jesus and sexual immorality will never be side by side.

765
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
 You will never be pursuing Jesus and sexually immoral.

766
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,880
 It will not happen.

767
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
 And so you can stop playing defense.

768
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,440
 Don't, don't, don't, thou shalt not stop.

769
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,900
 And you can start playing offense.

770
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,000
 Pursue Jesus with reckless abandonment

771
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,080
 and begin to live out your purpose.

772
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,180
 And when you do that, you will not fall into sexual sin.

773
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,860
 You will avoid sexual sin.

774
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,020
 The problem is not that you love sex,

775
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,540
 it's that you're not pursuing Christ.

776
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:24,860
 And so here's what I would tell you.

777
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,340
 I know some folks are like, well, but it's just sex.

778
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,220
 It's never just sex.

779
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,900
 You go on Twitter and search #metoo,

780
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,820
 and you're gonna see that it's never just sex.

781
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,740
 Somebody comes up and they talk to me every Tuesday,

782
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
 right up here.

783
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,180
 They can't look me in the eyes.

784
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,100
 They're broken.

785
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,340
 Some of the most broken people that I've ever met with

786
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,660
 are someone who has sinned sexually

787
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,940
 or been violated sexually in some way.

788
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,900
 And it is a, it's a sin against the self,

789
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,760
 the scripture says.

790
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,460
 It's a unique sin.

791
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,740
 It impact, I'm not saying them being violated is a sin.

792
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,840
 I'm saying that that, the person who sinned against them

793
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
 hurt them in a unique way.

794
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,020
 It was against themselves.

795
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,060
 The scripture puts it in all, you know,

796
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,820
 its own category.

797
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,580
 It says, hey, this one is unique when you do this.

798
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,100
 And this is why you can't get over your ex?

799
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,120
 This is why you wanna get drunk

800
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,000
 and have an excuse to call them?

801
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,220
 We wanna drink too much as an excuse to make a mistake?

802
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,760
 Because you gave yourself to them

803
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,120
 in a way that you weren't supposed to.

804
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,320
 And now they have your heart in a unique way,

805
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,960
 male or female.

806
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,160
 And I know it's true.

807
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,180
 And you know it's true.

808
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,520
 Because the way that God made sex,

809
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
 it's the highest levels of dopamine

810
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,220
 that someone can experience naturally.

811
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,020
 And what happens during sexual release

812
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,060
 is your brain creates a synapse.

813
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,440
 A synapse is like a muscle in the brain.

814
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,040
 It creates a synapse that bonds your five senses

815
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,020
 to your surroundings.

816
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,660
 Okay, this is where sexual perversions come from.

817
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,820
 This is where fetishes come from.

818
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,420
 You think, man, why, you know, is there foot porn out there?

819
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,060
 It's because some dude or some person

820
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,260
 has bonded themselves to feet.

821
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,500
 And that's what the epitome of sexual attraction

822
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,560
 is for them.

823
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,540
 That's what happened.

824
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,780
 The reason that God made us this way

825
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,400
 is so that when we would experience sexual release

826
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,820
 with our spouse for a lifetime,

827
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,640
 they would remain the epitome of attraction to us.

828
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,840
 It's an unbelievable, beautiful design.

829
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
 It's why the scripture says,

830
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,020
 "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

831
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,160
 "and be united to his wife,

832
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,340
 "and the two will become one flesh."

833
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,380
 And today, secular psychologists and scientists

834
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,220
 call this phenomenon sex glue.

835
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,600
 That people during sex are bonded to each other.

836
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,740
 And what happens when you bond

837
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,940
 to multiple two-dimensional images

838
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,080
 in a pornography struggle or addiction

839
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,140
 is you're rewiring your body not to bond.

840
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,740
 And what happens is when you've been promiscuous

841
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,660
 with multiple partners is you're teaching your body

842
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,780
 not to bond, not to stick.

843
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,800
 And you're training yourself for variety.

844
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 You are growing an addiction not to sex, but to variety.

845
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,860
 You are not training yourself for monogamy,

846
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,600
 but polygamy and adultery.

847
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,820
 And for many of you, you just had a light bulb moment

848
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,980
 'cause you look at our world, you see the divorce rate,

849
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,160
 you see how adultery is at an all-time high.

850
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,920
 Divorce rate's at an all-time high.

851
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,540
 Marriage at an all-time low.

852
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,420
 And can I just say something here?

853
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,580
 We are not getting better at this.

854
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,180
 We've got more tips and tricks and techniques

855
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,140
 in the grocery store than we've ever had

856
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,540
 in the history of history.

857
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,940
 And we stink at this in the biggest way.

858
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,140
 Your generation is the worst at sex

859
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,000
 and the worst at marriage than any other generation

860
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,160
 that has ever lived.

861
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,620
 And what's the solution?

862
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,980
 You.

863
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560
 Pursuing Jesus.

864
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,280
 Being an example of what should be,

865
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,160
 displaying the kingdom, redeeming it.

866
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,760
 And I know that right about now,

867
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,960
 the condemnation is at an all-time high

868
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,880
 'cause you feel like you've blown it in a major way.

869
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,080
 And the Rolodex is spinning.

870
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,480
 And you know that last night you were on your iPhone.

871
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,020
 You know on Instagram you clicked those hashtags.

872
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,820
 You know you went down that path.

873
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,460
 You know just this past weekend you drank a little too much,

874
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,900
 you called the ex and said, hey, you wanna come over

875
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
 and watch a movie?

876
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:13,420
 And I want you to know that the enemy's real.

877
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,740
 He hates you, he hates your children,

878
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,320
 he hates your marriage long before

879
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,820
 you've ever met your spouse.

880
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,740
 He hates you.

881
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,840
 He hates creation.

882
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,840
 The reason that he hates creation, this is really important,

883
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,900
 he uniquely targets sex.

884
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,160
 And here's why, because the first Great Commission,

885
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
 God's plan to fill the earth with his followers

886
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,280
 was to be fruitful and multiply,

887
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,640
 fill the earth and subdue it.

888
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
 God literally looks at man and woman and says,

889
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
 hey, have lots of sex and have lots of babies.

890
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
 And raise them up to know me.

891
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,680
 And that's how I'm gonna fill the world with my followers.

892
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,160
 And so Satan, who it's one kingdom after another,

893
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
 he doesn't want God's kingdom to grow,

894
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,960
 he wants his kingdom to grow, he targets sexuality

895
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,840
 and he tries to pervert it in a very unique way.

896
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,300
 The last thing the enemy wants is for you to be

897
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,700
 in a healthy marriage where you have children

898
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
 and raise them to know the Lord.

899
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,760
 That's what he's after.

900
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,700
 He is targeting you.

901
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,260
 And so what do I do if I've gone too far?

902
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,020
 What do I do if I've gone too far?

903
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,220
 You need to know there's grace and forgiveness.

904
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,260
 You do not have to leave here tonight

905
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,940
 feeling guilty or shameful or condemnation.

906
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,180
 So you think, well, I might as well keep on going, right?

907
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,260
 I've already blown it.

908
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,900
 What do I do if I've gone too far?

909
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,080
 What do you ever do if you've gone too far?

910
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,300
 Let's just think about this for a minute, right?

911
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,700
 I do this a lot because sometimes when I drive,

912
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,420
 I just kind of daydream, my mind wanders,

913
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,340
 you know, anybody else?

914
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,700
 And so I'm driving and I'll just like miss my turn,

915
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,620
 especially if my wife's not in the car to tell me

916
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
 'cause she's good at directions,

917
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,720
 but I'll just be thinking about a sermon

918
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,980
 and what I'm gonna talk with you guys about

919
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,880
 and I'll just keep driving.

920
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,460
 I'll miss my turn or I'll miss my destination

921
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,500
 and I'll get down the road and I'll realize that,

922
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,660
 oh, it's back that way, what do I do?

923
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,780
 The first thing I do is I stop.

924
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,660
 I stop progressing 'cause I realize I'm going the wrong way

925
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,860
 so I don't wanna go any further, so I stop.

926
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,500
 And then I turn around and I reorient myself,

927
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,460
 I look at the destination I wanna be at

928
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,940
 and I move toward it.

929
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,060
 And that's what you do if you've already blown it.

930
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,580
 You stop, no more, I'm done.

931
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,060
 I'm not gonna go any further, okay?

932
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,460
 I'm gonna turn around, that's called repentance.

933
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,540
 I'm moving from my sin and I'm turning toward Christ.

934
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,860
 That's repentance, turning from your sin,

935
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,100
 turning toward Jesus, Bible study, community group,

936
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,900
 church, that these things would consume your life.

937
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,260
 All right?

938
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,380
 You confess, guys, this is what I did.

939
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,020
 This is where my boyfriend and I are right now.

940
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,580
 This is where my girlfriend and I are right now.

941
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,820
 This is what we've done.

942
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,380
 Hey, I need to say this out loud.

943
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,340
 Would y'all pray for me in a James 5:16 kind of way

944
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,100
 so that I can experience healing?

945
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,100
 I wanna confess it out loud, all of it, the whole truth.

946
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,360
 This is what I've done.

947
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,740
 You confess it, you bring accountability.

948
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,300
 Hey, guys, would you help me?

949
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,900
 This is a temptation to me.

950
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,460
 Would you text me at this time?

951
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,820
 Hey, I'm going here, would you reach out to me?

952
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,280
 Hey, would you pray for me at this time?

953
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,060
 Would you follow up with a question

954
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,780
 and you invite accountability into your life?

955
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,600
 Some of you, you're in a toxic relationship

956
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,900
 and what you need to hear tonight is break up.

957
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,180
 Others of you, you have addictions in your life

958
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,340
 as it relates to sex and what you need to hear tonight

959
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,840
 is pursue healing.

960
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
 It's been there since the fifth grade.

961
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,720
 It's not gonna go away until you say, I need help.

962
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,940
 I gotta pursue healing.

963
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,360
 My wife and I, this is a part of our story.

964
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,000
 We met as nonbelievers.

965
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,120
 We trusted Christ together.

966
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,200
 Our relationship was a train wreck, manic highs and lows.

967
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
 I love you, I hate you.

968
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,040
 Get out of my car, I can't wait to see you again.

969
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,340
 It was just a mess.

970
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,880
 We come in, Jesus enters our life.

971
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,360
 We're like, whoa, where have you been all our life?

972
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,720
 We realize instant the conviction of the Holy Spirit,

973
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,320
 we gotta cut this out.

974
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,880
 We pulled the parking brake on all things physical,

975
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,920
 but it was hard.

976
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
 It was very, very difficult.

977
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,480
 What we needed to do is to create new lines

978
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,520
 of accountability that had nothing to do with sex,

979
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,320
 like how we spent time together.

980
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,960
 She couldn't stay at my place anymore, obviously.

981
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,180
 We couldn't be alone.

982
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,320
 We had to change up the rules for us to make it to,

983
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,200
 and you know what happened?

984
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,800
 You know what I did?

985
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,880
 Call me crazy, you know what I did?

986
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
 It took me about a month, and I proposed.

987
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,720
 I bought a ring, I'm like, this isn't any fun, man.

988
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,920
 We gotta, you know.

989
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,520
 And we were married four months later.

990
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,480
 That's the truth.

991
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,440
 That's the truth.

992
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,760
 And I didn't get off scot-free.

993
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,080
 Like, I didn't escape all the consequences.

994
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,600
 I brought the consequences into my marriage.

995
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,360
 It took about two and a half years of serious recovery

996
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,840
 to take place in my marriage.

997
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
 But God has done such a redemptive work.

998
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,240
 Such an incredible redemptive work.

999
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,320
 But can I be honest with you?

1000
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,680
 It was a lot of work.

1001
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,760
 It was a lot of work.

1002
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,600
 And some of you, you're gonna leave here,

1003
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,340
 and this is my last word of warning for you.

1004
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,600
 You're gonna keep moving the wrong direction.

1005
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,320
 And I hate that for you.

1006
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,360
 'Cause I know firsthand how costly that is.

1007
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,120
 I grew up painting.

1008
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,760
 I'm an artist, I guess.

1009
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,680
 You know, like some of you guys are football players

1010
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,160
 and athletes and whatnot.

1011
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,840
 Art was kind of my thing.

1012
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,800
 And so I would go to this lady that grew up in a small town.

1013
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,000
 It was Miss Talbert's art studio.

1014
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,680
 And it was this elderly lady.

1015
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,040
 She's since passed away.

1016
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,600
 But she would teach us to paint.

1017
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,040
 And so there was just kids in there,

1018
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,920
 and we would paint on like glass canvases, if you will,

1019
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,840
 China, oil on China.

1020
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,160
 And so oil painting.

1021
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,720
 And whenever you would paint, she would teach you how.

1022
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,600
 If you'd ever mess up, you just raise your hand.

1023
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
 Okay, 'cause there's no way to like erase oil paint,

1024
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,480
 you know, and so you just have to raise your hand.

1025
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,280
 And this lady, this elderly lady,

1026
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,920
 who was an amazing artist, she'd come behind you,

1027
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,380
 and she'd put her hand on your hand.

1028
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,660
 And she would guide your hand on the canvas

1029
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,860
 to make something beautiful of your mistake.

1030
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,120
 And some of my favorite paintings

1031
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,560
 were the ones that I really messed up,

1032
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,720
 because she was so much better than me of an artist.

1033
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,920
 And so, you know, when she would get involved,

1034
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,320
 it would always end up beautiful.

1035
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,560
 And so there would be this brush stroke out of bounds

1036
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,640
 that, you know, it was supposed to be a flower.

1037
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,500
 And it was just, it was nothing that you could see

1038
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,160
 or notice, realize what it was.

1039
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,680
 And she'd come behind me, put her hand on mine,

1040
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,240
 and she'd make the most beautiful flower

1041
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,040
 you can imagine out of that mistake.

1042
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,800
 And this is what God does.

1043
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,360
 You stop.

1044
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,440
 I'm not gonna go any further.

1045
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,560
 I'm gonna turn around.

1046
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,000
 God, can you help?

1047
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,160
 Can you help me?

1048
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,200
 Can you drive from here?

1049
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,840
 And he comes in your life,

1050
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,160
 and he can make something beautiful

1051
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,840
 out of what you've done wrong, okay?

1052
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:28,040
 He makes amazing fathers out of fornicators.

1053
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,840
 He makes awesome moms out of abortionists.

1054
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,320
 He makes pastors out of pornographers.

1055
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,800
 He makes saints out of the sexually immoral.

1056
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,720
 He makes beauty from ashes.

1057
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,260
 That's what he does.

1058
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,060
 I'll give you two examples, and then we'll wrap up.

1059
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,920
 In 1 John chapter eight, I told you there's this woman,

1060
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,040
 she's caught in sexual sin.

1061
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,840
 And so all these guys surround her, and they pick up stones.

1062
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,480
 Can you imagine being this woman?

1063
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,200
 Like she feels guilty, she feels shame,

1064
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,640
 and now she's about to die

1065
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,740
 because they know Deuteronomy 22.

1066
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,760
 They've read it, they know what they gotta do now.

1067
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,040
 She was sexually immoral, and they gotta kill her.

1068
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
 To follow the law, they're gonna kill her.

1069
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,820
 They're gonna throw rocks at her till she stops breathing,

1070
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,240
 except Jesus shows up.

1071
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,920
 He steps in between the woman and the men,

1072
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,060
 holding the rocks.

1073
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,480
 He says, hey, let me ask you guys a question.

1074
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,380
 Whoever, which of you hasn't sinned?

1075
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,900
 Whoever hasn't sinned, you throw the first stone, okay?

1076
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:42,260
 And what you hear is the sound of rocks hitting the ground.

1077
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,580
 And these men walking off.

1078
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,140
 And he looks at her and he says,

1079
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,840
 no one's here to condemn you, huh?

1080
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:57,100
 No, sir.

1081
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,460
 Then neither do I.

1082
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,560
 Go and sin no more.

1083
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,800
 He doesn't say, neither do I.

1084
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,680
 Keep going, keep moving down the sidewalk,

1085
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,080
 keep doing your thing, lady.

1086
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,880
 He says, stop it.

1087
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,600
 Go and sin no more.

1088
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,520
 And I'll tell you another story

1089
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,600
 because that one was for the women,

1090
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,400
 but there's another story about a guy

1091
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,360
 who goes to his dad and says,

1092
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,240
 hey, Dad, I wish you would die.

1093
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,320
 The reason I wish you'd die is 'cause you got some money

1094
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,640
 and I'd like to have your money,

1095
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,920
 and there's lots of things that I'd love to do.

1096
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,040
 And his dad says, oh, well,

1097
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,580
 you don't have to wait till I die here.

1098
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,620
 Why don't you take half your inheritance?

1099
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,600
 He takes it, he goes to Vegas,

1100
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,680
 and he blows it on prostitutes.

1101
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,100
 He blows all the money on prostitutes.

1102
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,960
 He gets the expensive ones,

1103
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,040
 has some of the wildest, most crazy best sex

1104
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,280
 that you can imagine.

1105
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,640
 And he wakes up from a hangover,

1106
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,580
 got cocaine hanging out of his nose.

1107
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,240
 He's hungry, he has no more money.

1108
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,400
 The tables weren't good to him.

1109
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,560
 And he says, you know what I'll do?

1110
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,280
 I'll go back to my dad and I'll ask him

1111
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,280
 if I can be his slave because his slaves can eat.

1112
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,960
 And I can't and his slaves can eat,

1113
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,820
 so I'll go and ask him if I can be his slave.

1114
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,000
 And it says, so he got up and went to his father,

1115
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,680
 but while he was still a long way off,

1116
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,000
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him.

1117
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,580
 He ran to his son, threw his arms around him,

1118
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,200
 and kissed him.

1119
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,560
 The son said to him, father,

1120
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,240
 I've sinned against heaven and against you.

1121
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,540
 I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

1122
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,320
 But the father said to his servants, quick,

1123
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,840
 he interrupted him, quick, quick,

1124
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,000
 bring the best robe and put it on him.

1125
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,720
 Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

1126
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
 Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

1127
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,400
 Let's have a feast and celebrate.

1128
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,000
 For this son of mine was dead and is alive.

1129
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 He was lost and is found.

1130
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,520
 So they began to celebrate.

1131
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,240
 And if you're here and you're ready to be done

1132
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,040
 with the things that you've done and gotten caught up on,

1133
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,960
 you're ready to stop, you say, I'm done.

1134
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
 I realize there's pain in my life.

1135
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,680
 I realize there's hurts and addictions

1136
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,200
 and things that I can't stop.

1137
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,440
 And I'm calling that boy like I'm crazy

1138
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,460
 and I'm stuck on her like I'm crazy, but I'm done.

1139
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,440
 There's a party.

1140
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,940
 There's a party.

1141
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,400
 A party that awaits you,

1142
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,920
 that God wants to celebrate with you.

1143
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,680
 He's not like, well, hold on before you,

1144
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,160
 hey, let's talk about all these things.

1145
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,760
 So tell me about Vegas.

1146
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,840
 Give back.

1147
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,640
 I've been waiting on you.

1148
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,760
 He saw him from a long way off and ran,

1149
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,580
 picked up his robe and ran.

1150
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,400
 That's the God that is pursuing you.

1151
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,120
 You say, how do I know he's pursuing me?

1152
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,240
 Where are you right now?

1153
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,900
 On Tuesday, you're hearing this.

1154
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,080
 The Bible is clear in summary.

1155
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,860
 The Bible is clear that sex before marriage

1156
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,500
 is a sin against God because it is hurtful to his creation

1157
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,780
 and against his design.

1158
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
 How far is too far is the wrong question.

1159
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,380
 How holy can you be in your pursuit of a spouse,

1160
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,620
 in your pursuit of Christ?

1161
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,420
 And there is forgiveness and restoration available

1162
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,420
 to anyone who repents.

1163
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,660
 The old illustration

1164
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,580
 that is still very appropriate

1165
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,380
 is just that sex is like a fire.

1166
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,100
 The fire is powerful.

1167
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,260
 The fire is helpful.

1168
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,180
 The fire is one of, or arguably,

1169
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,980
 the greatest discovery in humanity.

1170
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,420
 It provides warmth and protection from the cold.

1171
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,500
 It provides light.

1172
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,440
 It provides energy.

1173
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,260
 A fire contained in the right place,

1174
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,200
 it makes your car go down the road.

1175
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,900
 But yesterday, I read about a family of four

1176
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,380
 who all died because in the middle of a night,

1177
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,460
 a log fell out of their fireplace

1178
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,700
 and it burned their house down.

1179
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,700
 And all of them died

1180
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,820
 because the fire moved outside the place

1181
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,540
 that it was supposed to be and it became destructive.

1182
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:12,740
 Buddy, there's wildfires going on in Colorado,

1183
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,260
 or has been, and he sent me this picture.

1184
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,820
 His family's house is right around the corner.

1185
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,200
 That's a Whole Foods that you can see right there.

1186
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,260
 And in the background, you see the wildfire.

1187
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,660
 And I would just commend to you

1188
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,500
 that this is our culture right now.

1189
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,620
 Our whole culture is being burnt up on your watch.

1190
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,800
 And some of you, you've experienced this fire

1191
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,620
 because you know your house burned down.

1192
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,760
 Your mom and your dad, they couldn't keep sex

1193
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,860
 where it was meant to be, and your house was torn apart,

1194
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,860
 and it was burned down, and that's a part of your childhood.

1195
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,540
 And you can't tell me that it didn't have

1196
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,140
 a tremendous impact on who you are and what you've done.

1197
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,540
 And some of you, you've already burnt your house down

1198
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,580
 long before you met your spouse.

1199
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,060
 And not because you've done something

1200
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,100
 that is unforgivable or that you can't,

1201
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,320
 or that God can't fix, but because you know

1202
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,320
 you're gonna leave here and you're not gonna change anything.

1203
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:04,980
 50% of sexually active people will contract an STD

1204
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,800
 before the age of 25, half, one in two.

1205
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,680
 The CDC estimates that STDs cause infertility

1206
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,700
 in tens of thousands of women.

1207
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,800
 I told you, Satan hates creation, procreation.

1208
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,300
 Statistics from the CDC would suggest

1209
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,900
 that one in four people in this room tonight,

1210
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,620
 or in any room listening to this,

1211
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,580
 have a sexually transmitted disease.

1212
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:32,540
 Nearly half of all births in the United States

1213
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,640
 are to unmarried mothers.

1214
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,540
 Nearly half of the children born here

1215
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,220
 are not born into a family.

1216
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:46,000
 This is responsible for millions, over a million abortions.

1217
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,700
 The divorce rate amongst couples

1218
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,860
 who have been sexually active before marriage

1219
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,860
 is significantly higher than those who have waited.

1220
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:02,180
 And if you could put sex anywhere, where would you put it?

1221
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,920
 All of these problems would go away

1222
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,260
 if we just had sex in the context

1223
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,500
 of what it was created for.

1224
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,700
 All of them would go away.

1225
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,580
 The divorce rate among couples who waited

1226
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,660
 is less than 5%, less than 5%.

1227
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,820
 From the Journal of Family Psychology,

1228
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,020
 who studied hundreds of couples who had sex,

1229
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,660
 those who waited and those who didn't,

1230
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,100
 they found that couples who waited,

1231
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,780
 both men and women said they had better communication

1232
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,820
 than those who didn't wait,

1233
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,300
 they had better sexual quality than those who didn't wait,

1234
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,160
 they had better relationship satisfaction

1235
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,060
 than those who didn't wait,

1236
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,940
 they had better perceived stability

1237
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,300
 than those who didn't wait.

1238
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,580
 So if you are God, if you are creator,

1239
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,340
 and you could put sex anywhere, where would you put it?

1240
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:55,620
 And what he did is he put it in the confines of a covenant

1241
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:01,180
 between a man and a woman who say crazy things

1242
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,020
 to each other, they look each other in the eyes.

1243
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,260
 And I've been there, I've had a front row seat

1244
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,640
 dozens of times.

1245
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,780
 I promise to love you for the rest of my life.

1246
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,980
 In sickness and health.

1247
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:22,420
 For richer or for poorer.

1248
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,080
 Until death do us part.

1249
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,420
 May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely,

1250
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,220
 if anything but death separates me from you.

1251
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,640
 (soft music)

1252
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,940
 God says that's the place.

1253
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:49,780
 He says in First Thessalonians to learn

1254
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,020
 to control your body in a way that's holy and honorable.

1255
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:57,500
 He says learn to, like it's gonna be challenging,

1256
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,720
 it's something you've gotta learn to.

1257
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,780
 You're gonna have to apply some effort.

1258
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,700
 Discipline yourself for godliness.

1259
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,740
 It's a challenge, you got natural urges.

1260
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,020
 They wanna take you down the conveyor belt,

1261
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,280
 the enemy's gonna work with that.

1262
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,940
 God says I have something better for you.

1263
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,740
 I'm not trying to rip you off, I'm trying to set you free.

1264
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,780
 I'm trying to give you life so that you might have it

1265
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,980
 to the fullest.

1266
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,880
 Your only problem is that you believed a lie.

1267
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,300
 I pray tonight that you believe the truth.

1268
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,820
 If you're not convinced, don't leave.

1269
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,660
 You read some article somewhere,

1270
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,020
 your cousin sent you who's a staunch atheist,

1271
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,580
 come up, we'd love to have the conversation.

1272
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,020
 We'd love to talk with you.

1273
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,980
 I challenge you, I challenge you.

1274
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,340
 If you don't believe, if you're not there yet,

1275
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,460
 you're not convinced, don't leave.

1276
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,860
 Let's have a conversation.

1277
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,200
 Let me pray for you.

1278
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,620
 Father, thank you for just all of these texts,

1279
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,700
 these scriptures, these truths

1280
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,220
 that instruct us in the way of life.

1281
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:13,980
 Father, we are the enemy, the accuser, you call him.

1282
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:20,100
 He speaks lies and he's after us tonight.

1283
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,580
 As we worship, would you move our hearts

1284
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,000
 toward affection for you?

1285
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,260
 Would you remind us that there's nothing that we've done

1286
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,420
 that's going to stop you from loving us?

1287
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,980
 Pursuing us, chasing us and wooing us.

1288
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,940
 And Father, would you turn our hearts back to you?

1289
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,080
 In the name of Jesus, amen.
