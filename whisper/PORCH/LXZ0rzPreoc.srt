00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 All right, let's go.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends up in the loft and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 in stage 2 and 4 in El Paso, Cedar Rapids, Boise, Idaho.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And as we are wrapping up, as JD said, the last course of 2020.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Which is so bittersweet.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 What a year.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We kicked off this year and started a series called Roaring 20s.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Where there was lots of anticipation and excitement.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 It had been a minute since we had been in the 20s.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Specifically it had been 100 years.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And we talked about the last time as a country we were in the 20s.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And we went through, man, the last time as 20s, it was called the Roaring 20s.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And the Roots was around and sliced bread was invented.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Prohibition was a thing.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Women's suffrage, holla at your girl.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Got passed.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And just what so much has changed.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And as I was praying through and starting to think about tonight, I

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 thought I would just start by doing a similar thing.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Not for the last 100 years but for the last 11 months.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Because who would have thought a year ago the world that we live in

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 and the way things would look would have gone through so much change

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 and challenges and hardships.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 In the last 12 months, we saw the year kick off with the Australian

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 brush fires, which people thought would be one of the biggest defining

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 things of 2020.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And oh, how wrong they were.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And shortly after that, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle decided to quit the

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 royal family.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Who knew that was even a thing?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You can just deuce his grandma and we're out of here.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Then the impeachment of the president and his acquittal in January.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And then tragically Kobe Bryant and his daughter on a helicopter crash.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And then not long after that, COVID-19 was introduced and

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 transformed everything.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Phrases like shelter in place.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Mask mandate.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Flatten the curve.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And then what?

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 To things that we're all very familiar with.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Hundreds of thousands of people would lose their life and millions of

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 people would lose their livelihood and their jobs and their homes,

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 their ability to provide.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 The Black Lives Matter protest after the tragic killings of George Floyd,

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And the waves of protests and riots that happened after that.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Chadwick Boseman's also tragic death, the Black Panther actor,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 after a four-year battle with cancer.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Supreme Court Justice, after serving for decades in

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 the Supreme Court, passed away at age 87.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And then the most crazy divided election in our lifetime.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Maybe ever.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 All of which 2020 would hold.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And not only held those things, but think about the things in terms of

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 practical life, the challenges that you,

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 the people that our country, that individuals have walked through.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Where things like going to see grandma has become a thing that comes with

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 significant risk to it.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Graduation parties were done away with.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Sports were done away with.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Weddings that never took place or if they did it was very small ceremonies.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Birthday parties that didn't happen.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So much of what was normal all stripped away.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 This has been a year that has been full of trials.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Where people, a larger number of young adults under 30 live with their

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 parents today than the highest number in our history,

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 which was during the Great Depression.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 52% of young adults under 30 today live back with their parents.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 A sharp increase from where it was a year ago in the 30s.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 The number of people who have gone back on the medication or just the

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 antidepressants and mental health challenges that have erupted.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I mean, people have been walking through trials.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And if that wasn't enough, there's also been increased temptation

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 because whenever you have to live at home, you're staying at home.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 You're all by yourself.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You live in isolation.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 You're cut off from what is normal.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The temptation to cope or to look for something to make life a little bit

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 take the edge off only increases.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So what I want to talk about tonight as we wrap up the year is something that

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I could not think of a more timely passage than just praying through how

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 to end this year.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And that is a passage in James chapter 1 where the apostle James walks

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 through how to handle trials and temptations.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 He walks through what is the truth about trials.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 What is the truth about temptations.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Because whatever trials are behind you, the truth about living in this world

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 is there's going to be plenty of trials in front of you.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 There's also going to be plenty of temptations that are just a part of

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 living in a world with a broken sin nature or broken self-destructive

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 desires in your own self and living in this world that we're in.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Like JD just said, who knows what and when things will exactly get back to

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 normal and even when they do, the trials that come from living in a

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 world that is not the way it was intended originally to be are going to be there.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So we're going to learn from James on the truth about trials, truth about

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 temptation and ultimately the truth about God to hold on to in the midst of that.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So we're going to be in James chapter 1.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Here's what we got to know about James.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 James, you probably didn't hear this growing up in Sunday school.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 James was the little brother of Jesus.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Jesus had at least two younger brothers, a guy named James, a guy named Jude.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Think about that.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 However good your firstborn sibling was, it pales in comparison to living in a

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 shadow of Jesus.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Think about it.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You're sitting at the dinner table, little James, nine years old, first

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 century, sitting at the dinner table, mom telling him, why can't you be more

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 like Jesus?

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I'm him, I'm going, why can't you be more like Jesus, mom?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He's the son of God.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 What am I supposed to do?

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 But James went through life and didn't just grow up in the shadow of his

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 little brother.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Eventually or at some point he found himself going, everybody else thinks

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 that this guy is the son of God and I don't believe it.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Jesus' own brothers, his family didn't believe he was the son of God, which

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 honestly makes sense.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And it's really one of the reasons why James is such a compelling argument for

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 the resurrection and the reasons that we have to believe.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Here's what I mean.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Who has siblings in the room?

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Anybody have siblings?

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Younger siblings?

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Older siblings?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 What would it take for you to believe that your sister is the daughter of God?

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Or your brother is the daughter of God?

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I mean, I'm going to be even further.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I'm not even going to touch that with a 10-foot pole.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Or your brother is the son of God.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I mean, think about it.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 No matter how good or how kind or how perfect everything was to Jesus.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 If he's your brother or sibling and you are like, dude, we grew up

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 together, went on family vacations.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I know all the things.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Definitely not the son of God.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 That's where James was at.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Until one day he saw his brother crucified for a crime he didn't commit.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And they got together and they buried Jesus, this guy with these massive

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 followings.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And James didn't believe it.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 He just thought he's a teacher and he's kind of out there.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And as they went to the funeral and they're burying Jesus, his brother,

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 sealed away in a tomb.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And three days later James sees his sibling Jesus alive, walking around,

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 after being killed and buried in the ground for three days.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And everything changed for James.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 He went from saying, man, I'm telling you, it's just my brother too.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 That is my Messiah.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 He said, one, the Savior of the earth.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And James came to believe in Jesus.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And he writes a letter to Christians spread out throughout the Roman Empire,

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 which is basically where all Christianity took off and took place and was

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 birthed.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And he writes this letter.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And it's been preserved and we have it and we call it the Book of James.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And it's a book of James instructions to Christians everywhere,

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 trying to figure out how to live out their faith.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And he launches immediately into a subject that's so timely for us.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Because he goes real quick, hey, my name is James, let's talk about trials.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And he jumps right in.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And what he has to say is so profoundly relevant, I think God is going to

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 speak and God is going to give us not just handholds for where we are today,

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 but for the Christmas break, for where you're headed to in terms of

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 temptation back at your home, for where we're headed to just in general as we

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 walk through trials.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So we're going to be in James chapter one.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm going to start in verse one and we'll dive right in.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 scattered among the nations.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Greetings.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 many kinds."

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 He doesn't waste any words, jumps right in.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Or your translation may say endurance or patience, the ability to keep going.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete,

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 not lacking in anything."

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 James launches in and says, hey, I want you to consider it pure joy whenever

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 you face trials of various kinds.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 The first thing I want to talk about is the truth about trials.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 On the surface you read that and like, James, how can you say that?

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 That's so insensitive that you wouldn't even say I should consider it joy or an

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 opportunity to have joy when I walk through trials, when I walk through

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 heartbreak and the relationship doesn't work out, when I find out my mom has

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 cancer, when I find out that I have an autoimmune disease, I'm going to have to

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 be on medication for the rest of my life about, when a pandemic strikes and I

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 lose my job.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Joy?

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Really, James?

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 How can you say that?

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Because James is going to give us or he's given us the truth about trials.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 One of the things that he lays out is it's not if you face trials.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's when you face trials.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 That's why I love the Bible.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's so unbelievably honest.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 In other words, there's a lot of preachers or people out there who are like, Luke,

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 you follow Jesus and nothing will form against you that will ever stand.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It's going to be great.

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Everything is going to work out.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Life is going to be, I'm believing for you 2021 or I'm believing for you 2020.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And then things like 2020 happened.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And they were promising things to people who have faith in Jesus that God

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 never promised.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Like if you follow Jesus, everything is going to be easy.

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The Bible doesn't teach that.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 James launches immediately and says, hey, you're going to have hard things

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 come your way.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 But if you let them, they can be an opportunity.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Well, because you know the purpose of those things, you can have joy in the

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 midst of those.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So the truth about trials is they're something that God will use to move us

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 towards stronger faith.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Why can we have joy?

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Because James says in the midst of a trial, in the midst of a challenge,

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 things are not going the way you want them to, something happens.

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And here's what he says in the verse.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They are the testing of your faith.

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Because verse 3, I don't know if they put it back up there.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Put verse 3 back up.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They are the testing of your faith.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Let me really quick leave it up there.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The word faith in this context, a lot of people are not sure what faith

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 means or ambiguously throw it out there.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Faith, what James is saying in this context is confidence in God.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 That's what the word would be synonymous with.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Your ability or confidence that God is who he says he is.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 He's going to do what he said he would do.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He's going to do everything he promised.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And he's accomplished everything he has said in his word.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 That's what faith is in this context.

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Hey, every time you walk through a trial, it is putting to the test your

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 confidence in God.

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Your confidence that God is good, he's in control, he's got a plan for my

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 life, what he says in his word about this life being a vapor is true.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He made me on purpose.

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 He made me uniquely.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 All the things that I say I believe.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 When I walk through a trial, James says, when life, man, just feels like

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 you're getting kicked every day, punched in the face, metaphorically speaking.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 When you walk through those things, it is putting to the test and revealing

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 to you what you really believe.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Not what you say you believe.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Not what you may be pretending to believe.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Not even what you were told as a child, this is what you should believe.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 But what you actually believe.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It puts to the test your confidence in God.

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 James says, hey, it's going to reveal where and what you actually believe

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 about God.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Why could that be a good thing?

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 The word they use for test is the same word in alchemy or alchemist, big

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 word, people who work with metals and gold and diamonds and try to test

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 what is.

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Is this fool's gold or real gold?

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 What do they do to find out if it's real gold or fool's gold?

256
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 They put it to a test and determine the strength of the metal and

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 determine if it's real.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And they're doing what they're like.

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 They're putting to the test what you actually believe.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Why would that be a blessing?

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Why would that be a good thing?

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Which says next in the verse, verse 4, which you can put back up.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Let this testing makes perseverance continue or finish its work so that you

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 may be mature or you may grow and be complete, not lacking in anything.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 In other words, as you walk through those trials, what you're going to

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 do next is it's going to reveal what you actually believe and it's going

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 to give you the opportunity to grow in your confidence in God.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 When you walk through that breakup and you decide despite the fact that

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 this is not what I would have chose, I'm going to trust you, God.

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I'm not going to do what everybody in my life is telling me to do, which

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 is man, just get back on Tinder or get back with that old girl.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I'm going to actually follow what you tell me to in the Bible.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And as you do, your confidence, you're going to grow and you're going to

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 mature in your faith.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 God will allow us to move through and to face challenges and trials.

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 To grow and mature and strengthen our faith.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 My daughter is two years old.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 She loves going to playgrounds, playing in like the tree fort that we have

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 here in Watermark at the Dallas campus.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And every now and then we'll go up to that tree fort, especially during

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 COVID when it's all locked down and nowhere to go.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 One of the few perks of working at this place.

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Nobody there.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 We go up there and play on the tree fort, playground.

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And she would go and have bridges you could run across and we would run

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 across and she would play.

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And there's one bridge that's not made out of wood, it's made out of

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 rope nets that are cross braided together.

289
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And you walk across and it's another form of a bridge.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Because she's two, she doesn't get I can't fall through this and

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 she would go out on the middle of this bridge and panic and go ballistic

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 and be screaming for her father to pick her up and get her off this net.

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 As her dad, here's the weird thing about parenting.

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 There's times where you have to let them learn on their own.

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 That net is not going to fall.

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You're going to be just fine.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Come on, baby girl, keep going.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 You got this.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And she doesn't want to.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And she's not sure that it can hold her.

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 But as her dad, I'm going, I know it can hold you.

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Keep moving.

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 In the same way, in moments of trial, God will allow us to go through

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 trials that we wouldn't choose but that he will use to show us that he

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 is enough.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That every trial in our life, James would say, is an opportunity for you

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 to grow in your confidence.

308
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Everything you say you believe, it's going to be exposed and you'll find

309
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 out what you actually believe.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And in those moments, if you choose to trust God and you keep walking,

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 you're going to find just like that rope is more than strong enough,

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 he is more than strong enough to hold you, to get you through it.

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And James says, that's why you and I can have pure joy.

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 The other blessing, and this is a huge encouragement, I think,

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 this past year, because everybody's been through trials.

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Everyone's been through a lot of trials.

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 If you made it out without facing one, man,

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 we need to have you teach next week.

319
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 We'll extend the porch next week.

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I think one gift that is given to us is that as those trials have come,

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 we get to discover, oh, man, these are some areas of my life and my

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 faith where I don't actually believe God is who he says he is.

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 We've all been confronted with how the chaos and uncertainty and just

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 challenges of life exposes some of the places where we may not really

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 believe God is who he says he is.

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And in that test, we discover where we are.

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It's like this, there's two types of exercise tests.

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 When you go and, you know, you enroll in Orangetheory or CrossFit or

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Bar Method or whatever other fitness class you're out there.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You go in, and the first day they're going to have you do a fitness test.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 What's a fitness test for?

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 It's to basically show you how out of shape you are.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And they have you do this test and they go through it and have you do

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 all the tests.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And it's for the point of discovering where you are so that you can get to

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 where you want to be.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And I'm like, this is where I'm at.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 If I want to get to a fitness goal, I got to know where I'm actually at in

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 order for me to get there.

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And this year has been a chance where God through the trials and testing

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 has given us the ability to discover, man, this I really don't trust him

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 with my singleness.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I really don't believe his way for sex is good or is right.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And I really don't think pornography is that big of a deal.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I really don't think it's that big of a deal to smoke marijuana every once

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 in a while.

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I really don't think it's that important to date the type of person God

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 says that all of us in the midst of trials, in the midst of the things that

349
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 we turn to, in the midst of the decisions that maybe are a byproduct of

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 being in the midst of what we are.

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 We discover where we are.

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And here's what I want you to know.

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 We're going to get to this in a second.

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Wherever you are, the best encouragement I would give you is be honest.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Just be honest with where you are.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I'm going, hey, you know what?

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I really don't believe God is as good as he says he is.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I really don't believe I should date the way that he says I should date.

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I really don't believe sex outside of marriage is that big of a deal.

360
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 The best thing, if you want to move to the direction of actually growing in

361
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 your character, growing in your faith, you've got to acknowledge where you

362
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 are now.

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And James says, if you want to grow and you want to mature, it begins with

364
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 knowing, hey, what do I actually believe?

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 What actually do I think?

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 What am I learning about myself in the midst of -- I know for me, man, I do

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 not like being controlled.

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 People tell me to wear a mask.

369
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I don't want to wear a mask just because you told me to wear a mask.

370
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 There's something that's broken inside of me where I realize, hey, when

371
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 people tell me what to do, I just want to turn into a street fighter and be

372
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 like, I'm going to tell you what to do.

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And that is not okay.

374
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And an area where I need to have God, man, take ground.

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 There's pride.

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 There's confidence.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And I don't want to be that man.

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I don't know what it is for you.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 One of the encouragements I would give you is take an honest evaluation.

380
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Where are you?

381
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 What do you actually believe?

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 What do you actually need God to take ground?

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Second thing he says, or he walks us through, it's not just trials in life.

384
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But it's testing -- excuse me, temptation.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 When he lays out after covering trials and this is what it looks like to walk

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 through that, he says this, verse 13 of James chapter 1.

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 When tempted, no one should say God is tempting me.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So he begins to talk about temptation.

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 He says any time temptation comes, cross one thing out, God never tempts

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 people.

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 So it's not God.

392
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But he is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.

394
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

395
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.

396
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 So James begins to unpack temptation.

397
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 The Greek words for trial and temptation are like crazy close.

398
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 In the Greek there's a little bit of play on words.

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But don't get distracted by that.

400
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 James is unpacking temptation and gives us the truth about temptation.

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I think a lot of us when we think of temptation, people use language, I was

402
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 on my way over here and this guy cut in front of me, not today Satan.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You're not going to have your way with me devil.

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And we're quick to point out that temptation comes from out there.

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And James says, no, no, no.

406
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 There's plenty of temptation that comes from in here.

407
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He doesn't mention the devil.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He says here's how temptation works.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He walks through and says it happens on the inside.

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 The truth about temptation is it comes from within.

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And that we fight it with the truth.

412
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I'll cover that in a second.

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The Bible says it comes from within.

414
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 What do I mean by that?

415
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 The Bible says this makes so much sense.

416
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 If you're not a Jesus follower, I don't know how you make sense of this.

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 What the Bible teaches, the reason why temptation comes from within, we

418
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 have a sin nature.

419
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 What is a sin nature?

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's a nature that comes from within.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I don't have to work to sin.

422
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 It comes very easy.

423
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Nobody has ever said the phrase, man, you know what?

424
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 2021 is going to be my year.

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I'm going to lust more than ever.

426
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I'm going to be angry more than ever.

427
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Really working on upping my selfishness game.

428
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I find myself being the selfless guy.

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I need to work on being more selfish.

430
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 No one has ever done that.

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Why?

432
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Think about that.

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Why is it so easy for you to be a jerk?

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Why is it so easy for you to be anxious and so self-focused and so

435
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 self-obsessed?

436
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Why?

437
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 That's what I mean by apart from the Bible, how do you explain that?

438
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Why can't we all in neutral be like, yeah, I'm just so happy all the time.

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Life is great.

440
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Why is that not possible?

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Why don't I have to work at lusting after other people?

442
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It just comes naturally.

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The Bible says it's because you have a sin nature.

444
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That's key to understanding.

445
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 If you're going to fight temptation, you have to understand where it's

446
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 coming from.

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 It's not from Satan, it's from within.

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 One of the key ways it comes from is not from Satan, it's from within.

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He uses an analogy, he uses two analogies really.

450
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 The first is a fishing.

451
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Lured and enticed and dragged away.

452
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Any fishermen in here?

453
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Anybody fish?

454
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Good.

455
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Two of you.

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 One of you.

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Great.

458
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Awesome.

459
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 2021 or 2020 took fishing away from people too.

460
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 This is how temptation works.

461
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You're fishing, you begin to go, man, that doesn't seem that bad.

462
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I'm interested in that.

463
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Just like a fish seeing bait.

464
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And all of a sudden you're going closer, closer, closer.

465
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And you're lured and hooked.

466
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 It's pretty important to know about temptation.

467
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 The way that temptation works is it always disguises itself as

468
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 something appealing.

469
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It says by your own desires.

470
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 This is how temptation works.

471
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 It appeals to the things you want, things you desire.

472
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 In other words, temptation, when it comes, if you were to put it in

473
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 your mouth, it would be like a fish.

474
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 It's like a fish in a pond.

475
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 In other words, temptation, when it comes, if you were to put it in a

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 food analogy, so to speak, temptation doesn't disguise itself as kale salad.

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Walking around, look at me, no salad, just salt and pepper.

478
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Delicious.

479
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That never happens.

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Temptation is going to come much more, if you will, to use an analogy or

481
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 metaphor.

482
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Like this hostess cake that you scarfed down when you were in second grade.

483
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Where it just pops up and you're going to be more tempted.

484
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's going to come in the form of something, man, that is appealing to me.

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 In fact, who wouldn't want to be tempted?

486
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 It's going to come in the form of something, man, that is appealing to me.

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 In fact, who wants -- all right.

488
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Okay.

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And intercepted.

490
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's harsh.

491
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Okay.

492
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 All right.

493
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Nope.

494
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Okay.

495
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 All right.

496
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Dump them out.

497
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Last four.

498
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Wow, man, you guys got to eat, dude.

499
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Hey, if you have this on, you don't have to eat.

500
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 If you have this on, you don't have to wear a mask.

501
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 All right.

502
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 In other words, temptation, when it shows up, and this is so huge.

503
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Because a lot of us are going to think, oh, man, if temptation is there, I

504
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 would totally see it and I would know it.

505
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And he says, no, no, that's the thing with temptation.

506
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 You don't even realize you're beginning to be pulled in.

507
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 You're walking past it.

508
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And all of a sudden you're hungry and you're sitting there.

509
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 You're like, hey, despite the fact that everybody else is eating one of

510
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 these hostess things, I don't need it.

511
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It's not for me.

512
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I don't want that.

513
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's not that good.

514
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And slowly by slowly, just begin to go, man, that -- it's just like --

515
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 maybe just like a little bit of icing here.

516
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I mean, I've already tried it, so I might have a little bit more.

517
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I mean, look, who even agreed that this was going to be the standard that I

518
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 would hold myself to?

519
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And slowly by slowly, in and in, James says, eventually, you're hooked.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 You're hooked.

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yeah, be careful when you're eating yours.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 [Laughter]

523
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And it doesn't seem that way in the moment.

524
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 This is going to be really hard to get rid of for the rest of this talk.

525
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 But you don't even see it and you're just going, man, it's just a little bit

526
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 or it's not that big of a deal.

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It doesn't really matter.

528
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And pretty soon at the end of every temptation, he says, you're lured,

529
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 enticed, hooked.

530
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 This is why first time, you know, you smoke a cigarette, it's like a huge buzz.

531
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 It's like, oh, man, wow, that's awesome.

532
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Second time, it's not nearly as much.

533
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Third time, fourth time, or vaping or e-cigs or whatever you want to call it,

534
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 it's kind of the same thing.

535
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Eventually you get to the place where you're like, I can't even be normal

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 without a cigarette.

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Like I can't even -- I can't even focus.

538
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 James is like, lured, enticed, hooked.

539
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 That's why you find yourself at home and you came home and roommate is not there

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and you're walking around and you're like, oh, man, we're supposed to go to dinner.

541
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 We're going a little bit.

542
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 There's nobody here.

543
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And, oh, man, I got my phone.

544
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You know, I can't leave yet even though I know I probably shouldn't be here.

545
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Like I struggle with, you know, pornography and I'm all alone.

546
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I just had a hard day.

547
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And when I have a hard day, I'm tempted to turn to porn, honestly,

548
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 because it kind of like lets me numb.

549
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 But I'm supposed to go to dinner.

550
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I got to charge my phone, so I'm going to hang a little bit longer.

551
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I charge my phone and I got to switch the laundry out.

552
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Maybe I'll just sit while I'm waiting.

553
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I'm checking Instagram.

554
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And there's a bikini pic.

555
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And step by step, and I'm back into porn.

556
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 That's why the dating relationship where it's like, hey, we're not going all the way.

557
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 We don't actually have sex.

558
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And we just kind of like -- we just love each other.

559
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I mean, it would be wrong if we weren't sexually attracted to each other, right?

560
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 We're going to get married or pretty much married in God's eyes.

561
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Cross boundary, cross boundary, cross boundary.

562
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Now we're sleeping together.

563
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And we can't even make it work without sex in the relationship.

564
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And James would say, took a little bite, took a little bite, and hooked.

565
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He says it's the way temptation works every time.

566
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And you've got to know, it's not going to come like some, oh, I clearly see it luring me in right now.

567
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 He says that's the challenge.

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You can't see the hook.

569
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 You just see what's on the outside.

570
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 You just see the thing that's appealing to you.

571
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 But every time that you and I walk down the path of sin, he uses another illustration of what comes forward.

572
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And it's such a, like, sobering, like, oh, man, you went from fishing to that?

573
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Or he says this in verse 14.

574
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 In verse 15.

575
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 After saying they're lured by their own desire, you can throw it back up there, Alex.

576
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Verse 15.

577
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 In other words, after that desire, and you're like, oh, man, I want that, I want that, I want that.

579
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 It brings forth and has conception.

580
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 He uses pregnancy language.

581
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 After that conception takes place, that sin, when it's full grown, it gives birth to something too.

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And it gives birth to death.

583
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It's eerily similar to him describing what maybe you've known, people have walked through or you're familiar with, which is a miscarriage.

584
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 That moment where there's a pregnancy and you're excited and it seems like there's life there.

585
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And then what's brought forward is not alive.

586
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 It's dead.

587
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 That's what I mean by it's, like, jarring, sobering.

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 James says that's what sin is like.

589
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It's like, oh, this is going to be awesome.

590
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 There's life here.

591
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And then there's shame.

592
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Disappointment.

593
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That's why, man, I live with a party, go over the weekend.

594
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 It's going to be amazing.

595
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 He says every time afterwards where you think there's life and then afterwards comes death, the hangover.

596
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He says every time sin takes place, there's a hook and it brings and eventually destroys relationships, brings death.

597
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 This is why the high -- and you hear about it, people who have affairs outside of their marriage.

598
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Feels like every other week someone comes out and having an affair.

599
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 You know what they weren't experiencing in the moment they were having an affair?

600
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Death.

601
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 They were thinking, oh, man, this is so terrible, I want to keep doing this.

602
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 They were thinking, man, despite the fact I know this is wrong, probably not right, feels like there's life here.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And then you see them on camera, see the children crying, see the family ruined.

604
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And it brought forth death.

605
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And James says that's what temptation -- you've got to understand the truth about temptation.

606
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 If you follow it, that's where it leads.

607
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So how do we fight temptation?

608
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 The Bible is very clear, and I've got to move really quickly on this.

609
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 The way that we fight temptation is with the truth.

610
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And that feels like a really easy thing to say.

611
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But over and over and over again it says the way that you and I battle or we live out our Christian faith,

612
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 we don't live according to our sin nature.

613
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 We live according to our God nature, the new spirit life.

614
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Those may be words you're not familiar with, you're back in church, but let me explain it as clearly as I can.

615
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 We begin to think, we begin to learn how God says we should think about stuff.

616
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 How do we do that? In God's Word.

617
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 In other words, the Bible over and over and over, we don't have time to go through it,

618
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 says how do you live out your faith?

619
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 How do you live out the new life?

620
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 How do you fight temptation? With the truth.

621
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Jesus attempted three times, Matthew chapter 4.

622
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 He's out in the wilderness, devil comes up.

623
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Gives them these three temptations, pretty crazy story.

624
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Every time Jesus responds with what?

625
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 The Word of God.

626
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Says man, that temptation, that appeals to me.

627
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Here's what God's Word says.

628
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The Bible says the way that you and I live out the new life is by beginning to transform the way that we think.

629
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 By living, knowing, reading God's Word.

630
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Psalm 119, David writes, "How can a young man stay on the path of purity?"

631
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And he means purity sexually, but he also means just like the path of pure life.

632
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 "By living according to your Word."

633
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Hello.

634
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "I seek you with all of my heart. Do not let me stray from your commands.

635
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I have hidden your Word in my heart." David's speaking.

636
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I've hidden God's Word, I've taken your Word, and I hid it in there, and I read it, and I hold on to it,

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and I try to live by it, that I might not sin against you.

638
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 In order for you to live by God's Word, in order for you to,

639
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "Hey, I'm not going to fall for those temptations. I'm going to begin to transform my life."

640
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You have to know God's Word, because you can't live with it if you don't know it.

641
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 In order for you to know it, you have to read it, spend time in it.

642
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Tonight, we're going to give anybody who wants one a Bible.

643
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 We've got thousands of them out there. They're NET, they're great Bibles.

644
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And this break, if you don't have a Bible, that's a gift to you.

645
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Even if you have one, you want a new one, gift to you.

646
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And this break is a great opportunity for you to begin to go,

647
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 "I am going to spend time every day with God and His Word."

648
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Let me challenge you. If you've never done that before, here we go.

649
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Ready for this? I dare you, for 31 days, that's December, read a proverb a day.

650
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 There's 31 of them. You can do one every day.

651
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 If you miss one, you know, pick it up the next day, and you're still marching through.

652
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 That means I open up Proverbs 1, that's what I do December 1st.

653
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Proverbs 2, December 2nd.

654
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Some of you guys are like, "I'm not a 101, I'm a 201 level."

655
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You can do that and walk through the book of John.

656
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And if you're like, "Man, extra credit."

657
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Challenge me. All the Gospels before the porch returns.

658
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Spend time. That's not that much.

659
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 People with good grades can do it tonight. All of them.

660
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And spend time reading, studying, applying.

661
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And as you cross through something that intersects with--

662
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Because most people-- Here's the deal.

663
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 It's not that the Bible-- The problem with most people, when it comes to the Bible,

664
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 and like, "I don't really like to read it."

665
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It isn't that the Bible contradicts itself, because it doesn't.

666
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 It's that it contradicts them.

667
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So every time that happens, I want you to circle it, and write it out, and go,

668
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 "Yeah, this is not what I think in neutral, or not how I normally live."

669
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And you begin to go, "God, help me to live out your word.

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Help me to apply the truth."

671
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Because behind every attractive lie or temptation is a lie.

672
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And the way that we fight that is in that moment, knowing this is the truth.

673
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 I can go down this path. I can look at pornography.

674
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I can have an affair. I can get wasted again.

675
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 But that is not just a moment.

676
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 That is a path that I'm stepping on.

677
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And I begin to go through in my mind, what is the truth, where he calls me,

678
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 to live according to his word, to not set my eyes on anything pure, Job 31 says,

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 to be sober-minded in all things, and I begin to rehearse and live out the truth.

680
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 So if you don't have a Bible, you can go do that.

681
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Others of you, here's what I want to do as it relates to truth.

682
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 This is going to be an acronym. HOPE is really helpful and really profound.

683
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And honestly, if you do the next three minutes worth of stuff, your entire break,

684
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 your future may change, for that I'm about to do.

685
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Because the way that we experience freedom from temptation is the truth.

686
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 One of the challenges that we have is drilling the truth into our hearts

687
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 and ripping out the lies.

688
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 So what I want to do is give an acronym of the word truth.

689
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And you know what truth?

690
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Truth is a choice that you have a decision to apply and live out.

691
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So what does it start with? It starts with you.

692
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Anytime you or anytime you experience an ungodly behavior in your life,

693
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 maybe, and this could be, man, I just like, when I think about my singleness,

694
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 I begin to freak out and I panic and get on 18 dating apps,

695
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 and I honestly make up various fake identities, and I'm like,

696
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 "Oh, do whatever you want. Whatever that is for you."

697
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Or maybe you're like, "I just get angry when I'm driving in traffic,

698
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 and I punch my steering wheel," or "I'm addicted to pornography,"

699
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 or "Me and my girlfriend, we messed up again.

700
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I want to walk through whatever the ungodly behavior is behind everything."

701
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 So you just write that out. You fill in the blank.

702
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 This is the ungodly behavior.

703
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Beyond most, or not most, all ungodly behavior, there's a trigger.

704
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 There's something that triggered you to go there.

705
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That's the T. The trigger, a triggers.

706
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 There's one thing, many things, could be dozens of things that could be behind it.

707
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And beneath that, there is a rooted belief.

708
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I'm going to explain all of this.

709
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Man, this is like life transforming for me.

710
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 There's rooted beliefs that are informing what leads to the behavior that's here.

711
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 There's rooted beliefs.

712
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Wrong beliefs.

713
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Could be wrong beliefs about God.

714
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Could be unrealistic expectations about the world.

715
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Could be just irrational beliefs.

716
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 This is where I have to expose what is driving or informing the ungodly behaviors in my life.

717
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And then the truth in God's Word.

718
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I've got to replace, that's the next T, the truth with the roots.

719
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 I've got to take out God's Word.

720
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Here's what it'd actually say, and I'll walk through a couple of examples to give you.

721
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And then H, which is helpful future response.

722
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 What's a helpful future response as I think about this?

723
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 In other words, hey, I want to change this behavior.

724
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Every time that I get panicked, I turn to something that I don't want to turn to.

725
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Every time that I get overwhelmed at work, I turn to pornography.

726
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Every time that I get stressed, I do a booty call.

727
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Every time, whatever it is for you, I don't want to do this anymore.

728
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I want to actually grow.

729
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 If you're in the room and you're like, actually, I'd like to change, this is for you.

730
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 If you're in the room and you're like, actually, I'd like to get worse, not for you.

731
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Turn out the next five minutes.

732
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 But here, for those who do.

733
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So let's say you struggle with road rage.

734
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Driving down the road, somebody cuts you off in traffic, you're like, oh, no, I didn't.

735
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Boom, punch in the steering wheel, punch in your console, and you're like,

736
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I can't even say any sort of acronym that would do anything.

737
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Words come out, and you're like, I can't believe it.

738
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And you're flying by, giving them the bird, and you're like, what's messed up with you?

739
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And then you've got the fish on the back of your car and everything else.

740
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Anyways, you've got the ungodly behavior, and you're like, man, why did that happen?

741
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Well, you would say, well, what triggered me is a guy cut me off in front of me on the way there.

742
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Maybe, maybe that's one of them.

743
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 That's probably one of them.

744
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Seems like it's one of them.

745
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Could be some other things.

746
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Maybe you had a stressful call, stressful email, something related to your boss,

747
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 that you're like, he's just such a jerk.

748
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 That also triggered you.

749
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 You're disappointed with whatever's going on in life.

750
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 There could be several triggers.

751
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Most people stop there.

752
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And they go, you know what would make my hand stop bleeding from punching things

753
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 whenever someone cuts me off?

754
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 If people would learn how to drive, that's what would make me stop bleeding.

755
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Nope.

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 In fact, to focus on the triggers, whether it's anxiety, things that make you feel that way,

757
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 it's really kind of a useless thing because you live in a messed up world.

758
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 You're going to reduce triggers sometimes, but you can just take Ubers everywhere, I guess,

759
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 but it's not realistic.

760
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 You've got to focus on the root beliefs.

761
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 What are the root beliefs that are underneath that?

762
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Maybe it's just wrong beliefs about, like, hey, God, you promised me an easy life.

763
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 People shouldn't be cutting me off as I'm driving.

764
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 He didn't promise you that.

765
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 He said in this world you're going to have trouble.

766
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Maybe it's just an irrational, unrealistic expectation that everybody should learn how to drive,

767
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 the speed limit, and watch where they're going.

768
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 That's irrational.

769
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 You don't do that.

770
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 There's something where you got exposed and go, man, that is off.

771
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Ultimately, maybe it's just selfishness, that you're just like, you're really selfish,

772
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 and you want your way and you don't want anyone else to do the things that bother you,

773
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 and you're selfish.

774
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 So then you take those and you begin to go, and God says do nothing out of selfish ambition.

775
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 God says this life is not about me.

776
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 God says in this world you're going to have trouble.

777
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 People are going to cut you off.

778
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 They're going to end up driving straight into you.

779
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You're not promised anything.

780
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 I need to begin to rehearse and go through all of those truths,

781
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 correspondence with the root beliefs that are there.

782
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Then I walk through.

783
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 This is the most helpful pregame of all time.

784
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 This is kind of afterwards, your hand's bleeding there, and you're like,

785
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 oh, I need to think of a better response to this.

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I go through a helpful future response.

787
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 By pregame, I mean like I'm thinking, not like pregame,

788
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 but like I'm pregame on what next time I'm going to do when that happens again.

789
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 They're going to cut me off.

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 You know what I'm going to do?

791
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 I'm going to go -- I'm going to change lanes.

792
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 There you go.

793
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Problem solved.

794
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 I'm going to hearse God that you tell me the anger of man is not accomplished

795
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 with the righteousness of God.

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 I'm going to walk through scriptures where you tell me to be slow, to be angry.

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 You know what, I'm going to pray for that person.

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 They're going to cut me off, and I'm going to be tempted to be like --

799
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 I'm going to pray for them.

800
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And you're walking through, anticipating, this is what I'm going to do.

801
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Maybe for you, you would say, man, I just struggle with anxiety,

802
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 and I just get overwhelmed with anxiety about singleness.

803
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 I find myself in an ungodly or unwanted emotion.

804
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 You know what triggered it?

805
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Pulled out my friend on Instagram, just got engaged.

806
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Now I'm overwhelmed.

807
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 I'm going to be alone.

808
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Another one bites the dust, and here I am headed to be cat lady.

809
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 I just feel a spiral.

810
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Maybe that's part of it.

811
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Maybe the other trigger is you just got broken up with.

812
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 You just got out of a relationship.

813
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 You just got out in, like, years.

814
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 So when you see that, you begin to spiral and spiral and spiral.

815
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And you may think, man, I just need to get rid of Instagram,

816
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 or, like, I need to get friends that are not --

817
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 that's the most, like, squirrel thing ever.

818
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 What you need to do is focus on the root beliefs that are beneath that.

819
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Maybe your belief is, like, hey, God, if I follow you, husband,

820
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 if I follow you, wife should be brought into my life,

821
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 and you're not giving me that.

822
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 He never promised that.

823
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Maybe for you it's the idea that you bought the lie or the wrong belief.

824
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 A life where I don't get married is not a life worth living.

825
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 That's a lie.

826
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Jesus had the most abundant, fulfilled, perfect life of all time, never married.

827
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And you bought a lie.

828
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 I don't know what it is for you.

829
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 But you've got to dig to that root belief.

830
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And then you go, what's the truth from God's word?

831
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 The truth from God's word is no matter if I never get married, Jesus is enough.

832
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And that relationship has the ability to satisfy any person in any heart

833
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 and allow me to walk through any hardship that I face.

834
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 The idea that life is not worth living, I'm going to replace it with the lie.

835
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 God, your word tells me this life is a vapor.

836
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 It's not about me.

837
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 And what I'm going to experience for all of eternity pales in comparison to focusing here.

838
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 And then I'm going to walk through a helpful future response.

839
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Next time I see that, see the Instagram pic, I'm just going to say, God, will you help me right now?

840
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Because I feel a little bit discouraged.

841
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Will you help me to find my hope in you?

842
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 I'm going to trust in you.

843
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And then I'm going to go comment and say, heart, heart, heart, love this.

844
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 So excited for you and Steve.

845
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 And I'm walking through.

846
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Some of you truly, like this exercise, you need to spend the next 30 days,

847
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 you need to do this.

848
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 You have an addiction or honestly just some like really dysfunction.

849
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 You need to begin to go, God, will you search me and know me and help me walk through this?

850
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 That's why some of you, honestly, you shouldn't date right now

851
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 because there's so many triggers and so many bad, toxic, messed up beliefs that are underneath

852
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 that the reason you get in a relationship, you're like, yes, I'm trying to follow God and he's a great guy.

853
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 And all of a sudden, boom, three days in, we're sleeping together

854
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 and something triggers that ungodly behavior.

855
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 And it's like, I feel like I've learned my whole life, wrong beliefs,

856
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 that in order to be loved, I need to give sex.

857
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And I got the impression he may not love me, so I go and give him sex.

858
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Like you shouldn't be dating right now because you need to root out those beliefs

859
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 with the truth from God's word before you're ready to date and move forward.

860
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 But the way that we fight temptation is with the truth.

861
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 He lands and ends, and I'm about to land the plane,

862
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 with I think one of the most helpful reminders of all of them.

863
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 So last section we'll go through.

864
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Do not be deceived, brothers and sisters. I love this.

865
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 I want you to think about the last 11 months.

866
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 I want you to think about just life.

867
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 And James would write to you what he wrote to these people,

868
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 facing trial and temptation.

869
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Don't be deceived.

870
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Don't let anyone trick you. Don't fall for the lie.

871
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 What lie, James?

872
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Every good and perfect gift is from above,

873
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 coming down from the father of heavenly lights. I love that.

874
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Heavenly lights is just a word for the stars.

875
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Who does not change like shifting shadows.

876
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth.

877
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 That's the gospel.

878
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 That we might be a kind of first fruits of all that he created.

879
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 James goes in, and I love this, and he ends with,

880
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 "Hey, hold on to the truth about God."

881
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 As you walk through trials, you walk through temptations,

882
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 you've got to hold on to the truth about who your God is.

883
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 The truth about your God, He is good.

884
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 He's not far. He's in control.

885
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Every good thing in this life, every good thing imaginable,

886
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 comes from Him, and He only gives good things.

887
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 And he walks through and he points those things out.

888
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Don't buy the lies of temptation.

889
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 That there could be anything good that is disconnected from God.

890
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 That's where He's coming.

891
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 That our God only gives good things.

892
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 And I'm going to explain how He can say that, how we can know that,

893
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and how we can even believe that.

894
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 My son is five years old, and a couple nights ago,

895
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 we were watching this movie, it was "Arthur Christmas,"

896
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 which I had never seen before.

897
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Not recommending, not opposing, but we were watching it.

898
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And in the movie, it's a Christmas show,

899
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 and it's about Santa Claus and Santa coming.

900
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 At some point, Santa is in the house, and it's kind of a --

901
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 don't get distracted by it, but Santa's walking around,

902
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 he's got the elves, and it's like a 20th century version of Santa.

903
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 So he's suited up, lots of technology.

904
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 The house is in, the boy wakes up, and Santa's in the bedroom.

905
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 And Santa's afraid he's going to get found, so he dives on the floor,

906
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 and he is laying at the foot of the bed, hiding from the little boy.

907
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 It's an average scene, not really much to talk about, unless you're five.

908
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 And your greatest fear in life is something hiding underneath your bed,

909
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 or at the foot of your bed.

910
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 So he begins to play through this tape in his mind.

911
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 I go upstairs, I put him down to bed.

912
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 I don't know, he's playing that tape, and I read him a story, bedtime prayers.

913
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 "Goodnight, son. Love you."

914
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Why was Santa at the foot of the bed?

915
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Santa was at the foot of the bed.

916
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 No, Santa's not. He doesn't come into kids' bedrooms.

917
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 "Santa underneath my bed, Dad.

918
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 I don't want him in my bed, Dad."

919
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 And he's walking through, and he's terrified.

920
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 I'm trying to explain Santa.

921
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Normally, like a one-year-old is terrified of Santa, but a five-year-old, like,

922
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 "Dad, Santa's going to break into our house?

923
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 That doesn't feel safe, Dad."

924
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 And I'm trying to explain, like, "No, no, no, no,"

925
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 because he's still trying to get even Santa Claus,

926
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 and story for another time.

927
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 But as it relates to that, I'm going, "No, no, no, Santa,

928
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 he only comes down the chimney.

929
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 There's a secret about Santa I'll tell you someday,

930
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 but Santa, he just brings good gifts.

931
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 He just brings good things.

932
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 You don't have to be afraid. He's not going to stop by your room.

933
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Please don't let him stop by my room, Dad."

934
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 He only brings good things.

935
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 What happened was he got this wrong impression of what Santa was like,

936
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 though Santa was real anyways.

937
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 But he saw this wrong version of it, and he held on to that.

938
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 And he couldn't wrap his mind around, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

939
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 no, Santa, he only--he brings good things.

940
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Like, Santa, he's jolly, he's great, got the reindeer."

941
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 He held on to a wrong version of him.

942
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 Couldn't see that, "No, no, no, he brings good things in your life."

943
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 And James says to his audience, and he would say to you when he says to me,

944
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 "Hold on to the right version of your God.

945
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 Don't interpret God through the lens of your circumstances.

946
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Interpret your circumstances through the lens of who your God is.

947
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Your God is good.

948
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Every good thing in this life, every good thing that has ever existed,

949
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 it comes from one place, from one source, and that is God.

950
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 He's not only good, he's great, the Father of lights."

951
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 What does that mean? It's the Father of the stars.

952
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 James points out he's the God of the cosmos, he's the God of all that is,

953
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 he's the God of existence, he's not just good, he is great.

954
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 And in the face of temptation, you've got to hold on.

955
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 In the face of trials, you've got to hold on, because what do we all question?

956
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 In the midst of trials, we question, "Where are you, God?

957
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 How long are you going to let this happen?

958
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 Don't you--do you even care what I'm walking through?"

959
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 And we begin to question, "Are you really good?"

960
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 James says, "No, no, no, don't get a wrong version of who your God is.

961
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 He's good."

962
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 And then he lays out the most beautiful verse and powerful truth--you've got to hold on to it,

963
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 but to wrap it up--of how James would say, "Here's how I know he's good.

964
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 Here's how you can know he's good."

965
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 Because it was him who chose us--verse 18, put it back up there, Alex--

966
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 he chose to give us birth.

967
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 That's talking about new life.

968
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 He's talking to Christians. He's saying, "This is what God did for you.

969
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 You didn't do this. I didn't do this for you.

970
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 And your mama didn't do this for you.

971
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 God chose to give us birth through the word of truth."

972
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 That's the gospel.

973
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 That's the message that Jesus, God, came into this world to die for you and for me, for sinners everywhere.

974
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 You don't earn your way to God.

975
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 He extended an invitation where he paid for your sins.

976
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 He says, "Everyone's welcome. I paid for your sin.

977
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 I paid for everything messed up you've ever done.

978
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 And if you will trust not in how good you are, how many times you've been to church,

979
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 or allow whatever bad things you've done to make you think I don't love you,

980
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 if you'll trust in what I did on the cross for you, paying for your sin, and rising from the dead,

981
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 you will have eternal life.

982
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 You will be born again."

983
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 And James says, "You didn't choose that.

984
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 When you walk through trials, you remember who your God is.

985
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 You didn't work your way into a relationship with him,

986
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 which means you can't work your way or send your way out of it.

987
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 It was God who chose to give you a new birth.

988
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 It was God who started all of this.

989
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 He's the one who gave his life, who started this work in you.

990
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 He's not going to let you go."

991
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 He says, "None who are in my hand will ever be able to escape it."

992
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 So when you walk through trials, when you walk through temptations,

993
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 when you feel down and out, you remember who your God is.

994
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

995
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 There's no shifting or shadows in the midst of him.

996
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 He's the Father of lights who's in control, and he loves you.

997
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 And James says, "When you're tempted to believe he's not good,

998
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 his way's not good, hold on to the truth about your God."

999
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 That's the third idea.

1000
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Just like you didn't choose to be born from your parents,

1001
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 no one who is a follower of Jesus chose that.

1002
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 God allowed that to happen.

1003
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Just like I've got two kids.

1004
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Neither one of them played any role in coming into existence.

1005
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 Mama, Daddy played that role.

1006
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 They didn't choose it.

1007
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 They just got brought along, and James says, "He chose."

1008
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 That's the message of the Bible.

1009
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 He chose.

1010
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Every Christian, every person, they don't get credit for it.

1011
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 This is why it's such unbelievably good news that you cannot escape, outrun.

1012
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Work yourself out of a relationship with God if you've trusted in him,

1013
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 and you can hold on to that hope no matter what 2021 has,

1014
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 no matter what the rest of this year has.

1015
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 And James says, "Hold on to the truth about your God."

1016
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 No matter what you face and what you walk through,

1017
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 what he has done, what he will do, he is good.

1018
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 How do I know he proved it, James would say,

1019
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 when he gave his life for you, for me,

1020
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 for anyone who was simply accepted on the cross?

1021
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 Let me pray.

1022
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 I want to do something that we don't often do here,

1023
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 but I want to invite you to close your eyes.

1024
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 I know every single week there are hundreds of young adults who join us

1025
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 that are here for the first time, many of whom have never had a place

1026
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 or a moment where they put their faith in Jesus,

1027
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 and they've trusted in what Jesus did on the cross.

1028
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 And it would be such a miss, and I've just felt this burden from the Lord.

1029
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 There are some in this room who tonight,

1030
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 you feel God calling you into a relationship with him,

1031
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 inviting you to step out of the darkness of your life,

1032
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 out of the pain, out of whatever it is, and into his forgiveness,

1033
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 that you can experience at a soul level,

1034
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 beginning to be healed, forgiven,

1035
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 and what Jesus would say, completely righteous.

1036
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 No matter what you did today, what you do tomorrow,

1037
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
 or 20 years from now, you will be in a moment forgiven,

1038
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 and it only happens one way,

1039
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 by receiving the free gift that Jesus gave us on the cross.

1040
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 And I would hate to end 2020 without giving you a chance

1041
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 for the most significant, important decision you're going to make

1042
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 for the rest of your life, for you to make,

1043
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 which is to put your faith in Christ.

1044
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 The invitation that God has given to just say, "Man, I'm a sinner.

1045
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 "I acknowledge I don't deserve to have a relationship

1046
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 "with the perfect, holy God.

1047
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 "But if what is written in the Bible and the gospel is true,

1048
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 "that you made a way for me to have that relationship

1049
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 "by giving your life for me,

1050
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 "I just want to accept that free gift by faith.

1051
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 "I'm putting my trust, not in me, but in Jesus."

1052
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 And if you're in that place, I want to invite you right now,

1053
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 if you just raise your hand, everybody's eyes are closed,

1054
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 wherever you're at, and I want to lead you just in a prayer.

1055
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 And you're going to make the most important,

1056
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 significant decision you're going to make

1057
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 for the rest of your life.

1058
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Wherever you are, raise a hand.

1059
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 If you're ready to say, "Man, I'm going all in.

1060
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 "I'm ready to accept God's grace, His forgiveness.

1061
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 "It was for me.

1062
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 "It was for me to see you down here, over here."

1063
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 I want to make the most important decision

1064
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 I'm going to make right here.

1065
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 Anyone else?

1066
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 We're here.

1067
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 Those who are raised hands, we just, I'm going to pray,

1068
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 and you just, wherever you're at, quietly,

1069
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 you can pray after me.

1070
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 The prayer to unsave you, the prayer is a reflection

1071
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 of the faith that you are expressing at heart level.

1072
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 There's no magic words.

1073
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 It's putting your trust in Jesus.

1074
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Just wherever you're at, quietly, to yourself,

1075
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 as loud as you want.

1076
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 Father, I know I'm a sinner.

1077
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 I know that I don't deserve to have a relationship

1078
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
 with a holy, perfect God.

1079
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 But I'm putting my trust in what you did

1080
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 through sending your son, Jesus,

1081
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 to die the death I deserved

1082
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 after living a life of perfection I couldn't live,

1083
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 and he did that for me.

1084
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 And I'm putting all of my faith, all of my trust,

1085
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 all of my hopes of eternity

1086
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 on no one other than Jesus

1087
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 and His death and His resurrection.

1088
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 I thank you that because He rose again,

1089
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 I will rise,

1090
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 and I will live forever with you in eternity.

1091
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Take my life, use it,

1092
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 and make me more like your son,

1093
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 my Savior, Jesus.

1094
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 In His name we pray, amen.
