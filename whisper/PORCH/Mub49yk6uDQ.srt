1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,120
 - All right, how's it going?

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,200
 Hey, I don't know if we have met before,

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,120
 unfamiliar face, my name is Graham Shelby.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,480
 I serve on the leadership team here at the Porsche.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,240
 I am so excited to be with y'all tonight.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
 So if you're tuning in here

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,400
 with those who are seated around us in Houston, El Paso,

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,840
 Chicago, for some of my friends,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
 or wherever else you are tuning in,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,860
 we are so excited for you to be here tonight.

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,700
 Hey, I got a quick question.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,840
 Has anybody moved recently?

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,000
 Anybody moved recently?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,080
 Right, it's the summer season, people are in transition,

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,500
 leases are coming up.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,160
 If you have a truck,

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,540
 you just went up like three levels in popularity

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,000
 with your friends to becoming the best friend ever, right?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
 'Cause now your truck is being used to move every couch

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,720
 in your friend group across, right?

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,360
 So let me tell you a story.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,640
 I have moved three times in the last four years,

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,720
 three times in the last four years.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,000
 And really when I was moving,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
 I went through what I think all of us go through, right?

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,600
 Which is I have to start chasing my mail.

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,960
 I have to start chasing my mail

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,360
 because I'm changing my permanent address.

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,880
 And so I'm trying to keep up

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,120
 with telling all of the necessary parties

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,620
 of where you need to send me the relevant mail.

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,840
 And then now I'm trying to sift through all of the mail

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,720
 that seems to be following me that's not my own.

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,240
 You tracking with me on that?

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,740
 So recently, not recently, after college,

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,000
 I moved to Chicago.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,320
 Moved to Chicago for a school teaching job.

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,840
 And I moved in to an apartment

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,960
 with three other guys that I met.

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,080
 And so we get this apartment, we start living together.

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,280
 And of course we get our mail.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,240
 And as we're picking up our mail in the first few weeks,

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,560
 I'm noticing my name, all the other people's names.

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,720
 And then we're noticing this one name that's like,

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,280
 who is this name?

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,480
 And her name's Katie Romero.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
 And all of a sudden we get some letters

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
 and we're like, ah, that's not me.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,320
 But then we start to get a lot more things

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,720
 that are addressed to Katie.

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,320
 Like we start getting Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.

54
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
 And we're like, okay, cool.

55
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
 I don't really know, that's not for me,

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,020
 but I'll take it, I guess, right?

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,440
 And then it starts to become an educational process.

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,140
 Like we start getting these things called Sephora ads.

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,920
 I don't know, I have no idea what that even is,

60
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,200
 but I started to learn what cosmetics were all about.

61
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
 And I was like, okay, cool, Sephora,

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,240
 that's not relevant to for teachers

63
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,880
 that are living in Chicago.

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,960
 I mean, then we're getting things

65
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,640
 like Planet Fitness membership letters.

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
 We were like, man, who is this Katie Romero?

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
 And we started to get, I mean,

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
 we literally got in the mail one time

69
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
 of Victoria's Secret Magazine.

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,220
 And we were like, man, I don't know if Satan

71
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,960
 is behind the United States Postal Service,

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,760
 but we were experiencing some major spiritual warfare

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,720
 because that's not me, right?

74
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,140
 This is not who it's supposed to go to.

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,040
 And I think for many of us in the room tonight,

76
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,900
 for being honest, when we hear about the topic of generosity

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,640
 we think the same way.

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,940
 When we hear someone talk about this concept

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,180
 of generosity and giving,

80
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,760
 sometimes our instinctive reaction is to say,

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,040
 hey, that message is not for me.

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
 I think that's for someone else.

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,600
 It's not a message for me.

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,120
 And we think just like Sephora ads aren't applicable

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,960
 to a household of four guys.

86
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,520
 We say, hey, at least not right now,

87
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
 the conversation of me giving away things

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
 is not relevant to my life as a young adult.

89
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,680
 I think the reason we feel this way is threefold.

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,920
 First off, some of us are sitting in the room here tonight

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,200
 and we say, hey bro, this is your first time here.

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
 You may not know me, but I have student loan debts.

93
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,320
 Did you know that the average student loan debts

94
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
 is $40,000?

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
 I'm working a double job.

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
 I have debt that I'm paying.

97
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,780
 I can't be generous right now.

98
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,800
 I don't think you get it.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,160
 I'm trying to pay rent and just get by.

100
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
 Generosity, great concept.

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,520
 Thanks for teaching, not for me.

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,800
 Other people in the room tonight may say,

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,840
 hey, I don't think you realize,

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
 at least for those live here, that we live in Dallas.

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,020
 Like have you realized that the average vehicle

106
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,020
 driving on the roads right now is a Range Rover

107
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,760
 and I drive a 20 year old Camry?

108
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,200
 It's not making sense.

109
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,440
 The standard of living that I am trying to catch up to

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,460
 and that I'm trying to achieve

111
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,520
 is not one that I currently have.

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,420
 And so as I try to elevate my standard of living

113
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,680
 and chase after that,

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,280
 then I'll be able to elevate my standard of giving,

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,760
 but not right now.

116
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,960
 And I think the last group of us,

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,020
 we'd say, hey, thanks for sharing this,

118
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,040
 but I think I'm generous already.

119
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,220
 Thanks for presenting that idea,

120
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,520
 giving me that piece of mail,

121
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
 but it's not addressed to me because, bro, I'm generous.

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,720
 You know, I give good birthday presents

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
 and I give to that one guy at one time.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,440
 And so thank you, but pass your note along to someone else.

125
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,540
 And I think I'm exempt from that

126
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,360
 because of some perceived percentage, standard or amount.

127
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,720
 And I'll just be honest with you guys.

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,700
 We don't know each other

129
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,500
 because I haven't communicated here ever,

130
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,660
 but God over these last few weeks has grown my heart truly.

131
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,900
 God over these last few weeks,

132
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,340
 as I've been studying the scriptures

133
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,900
 on what it means to be generous,

134
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,180
 God has grown my heart.

135
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,820
 He has wrecked my heart on this topic

136
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,140
 because I showed up

137
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,340
 and I would have thought the last thing.

138
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,060
 I would have thought, you know, I think I'm pretty generous.

139
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,700
 I think I do a pretty great job

140
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,460
 of giving myself my resources away.

141
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,320
 But as I looked at what God's word said,

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,980
 I realized I don't think I'm as generous

143
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,420
 as I thought I was.

144
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,340
 I don't think I'm generous at all,

145
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,260
 according to what God says.

146
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,560
 And it's not because I don't make enough money.

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,340
 It's because I don't fully grasp what God has done for me

148
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,020
 and his intention for my life.

149
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,180
 And I realized that I wasn't stealing from God

150
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,460
 as much as my lack of generosity was stealing from me.

151
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,620
 And I say that in full sincerity.

152
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,140
 And I'll elaborate that on a little bit later,

153
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,460
 but you need to know

154
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,500
 that you don't have some field expert,

155
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,580
 prodigy in generosity speaking to you tonight.

156
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,020
 You have a peer under construction,

157
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,860
 growing in obedience to this concept.

158
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,120
 And I'm excited to tell you what I've learned so far.

159
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,140
 I'm excited to tell you how God's shaping

160
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,620
 and reshaping my heart.

161
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,820
 And I'm excited to tell you who God is

162
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,780
 and challenge you and call you to an abundant life

163
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,060
 that he would have for you.

164
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,940
 The Bible says that generosity,

165
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,440
 if you and I are unable to practice it

166
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,140
 and experience it, it's going to rob you

167
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,260
 both in this life and the next.

168
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,980
 And there's no better time to be generous than right now.

169
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,260
 And most of you, when you hear that,

170
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,340
 all you think about is money.

171
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,660
 Church just wants my money.

172
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,300
 God just wants my money.

173
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,580
 And it's so much more than money.

174
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,180
 And if we don't understand what true generosity is,

175
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,300
 we're gonna miss out on the true life

176
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,940
 that God has intended for us.

177
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,620
 And so tonight we're gonna look specifically

178
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
 at this idea of generosity

179
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,140
 and we're gonna continue it in the series,

180
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,260
 "The Remnant."

181
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,980
 And we're gonna look at three things

182
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,520
 that it relates to this idea of generosity.

183
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,320
 The first one comes from Acts chapter four.

184
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
 So if you have a Bible,

185
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,740
 you can follow along in the book of Acts.

186
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,640
 It's in the New Testament.

187
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,740
 Acts is the book that talks specifically

188
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,420
 about the birth of the church, the remnant,

189
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,180
 the early church that immediately follows

190
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,340
 the life of Christ.

191
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,960
 And in chapter four, we get a really, really good picture

192
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,820
 at how this remnant operated.

193
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,220
 And so in chapter four, verse 32, follow along.

194
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,860
 Now, the full number of those who believed

195
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,340
 were one heart and soul.

196
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,180
 And no one said that any of the things

197
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,940
 that belonged to him was his own,

198
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,860
 but they had everything in common.

199
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
 And with great power, the apostles were giving

200
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,540
 their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.

201
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,700
 And great grace was upon them all.

202
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,060
 There was not a needy person among them,

203
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,180
 for as many as were landowners or had houses,

204
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,340
 they sold them.

205
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,700
 And they brought the proceeds of what was sold

206
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,260
 and they laid it at the apostles' feet.

207
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,860
 And it was distributed to each as any had need.

208
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,180
 My first point from the text tonight is this,

209
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,420
 that true generosity marks the people of God.

210
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,300
 True generosity marks the people of God.

211
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,780
 It's so easy for us to glaze over what I just read

212
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,500
 and to not think and understand how that practically

213
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,540
 plays itself out and just how insane that lifestyle was.

214
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,740
 Like I'm in commercial real estate.

215
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,060
 I work in the commercial real estate industry.

216
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,900
 I don't think I've ever come across someone

217
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,460
 who was like, yeah, I own this building

218
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,740
 and I'm just gonna give it away.

219
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,380
 I'm just gonna sell it and give it to that guy.

220
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,700
 And actually just take the money

221
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,860
 and just give it to the church.

222
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,180
 My mom, she's a realtor.

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,980
 She helps people buy and sell homes.

224
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,460
 I don't think she's ever come across someone

225
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,860
 who's like, yeah, we're just gonna sell our home.

226
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,660
 No, we're not looking to expand.

227
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,980
 We're not looking to get another second story

228
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,100
 or another house for our car.

229
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,980
 We're just gonna sell it

230
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,100
 because we follow this guy named Jesus.

231
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,740
 And we know this guy named John and he was in need

232
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,220
 and we just thought it was our job to care for him.

233
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,700
 And so we're selling our house

234
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,740
 and we'll all go live in an apartment.

235
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,340
 And that's crazy, right?

236
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,860
 You don't hear that happening in our world today.

237
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,580
 And that's how it was.

238
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,100
 They were selling the things that they had.

239
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,940
 I mean, you think about it,

240
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,900
 Jerusalem, they weren't known for their lake houses

241
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
 back in that day, right?

242
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,980
 They weren't known for their second and third homes.

243
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,580
 These people weren't giving out of excess.

244
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,220
 They were giving their essentials,

245
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,300
 the things that were necessary for them to operate

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,820
 and function out of their daily and normal lives.

247
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,580
 And if any of this happened today in church,

248
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,660
 it would make news, front page news, right?

249
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,060
 I mean, if people today were like,

250
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,860
 guys, we're all gonna get the same bank account.

251
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,700
 Hey, what's your name?

252
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
 I'm Graham.

253
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,360
 Nice to meet you, Jerry.

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
 Yeah, okay, cool.

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,300
 And like, we're gonna put all our funds together.

256
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 Yep, we're doing it.

257
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,780
 Like that would be called a cult.

258
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,940
 People would say that's a cult.

259
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,460
 And it's so radical.

260
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,500
 It just doesn't make sense

261
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,620
 to our American individualistic mindset

262
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,460
 that's so focused on the word mine and not the word ours.

263
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,380
 And we just don't understand community.

264
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,700
 I mean, we look at that and we say,

265
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,780
 that's irresponsible at least.

266
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,680
 And we say that that is flat out stupid at most.

267
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,420
 And yet, that's the way the people of God thought.

268
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,420
 They said, everything that we own is not our own.

269
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,600
 Everything that we have is not our own.

270
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,800
 And they said, hey, we're not meant to be a reservoir,

271
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
 but a river.

272
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,280
 And what I mean by that is we're not meant

273
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,460
 to just be an accumulator of things

274
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,160
 that just accumulates more and more stuff,

275
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,040
 but we're meant to be a funnel

276
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
 through which the things that we have

277
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,640
 just flows through our hands consistently

278
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,520
 to give to those in need.

279
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,160
 They just said, we're gonna be a river.

280
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
 And that's insane.

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
 And some of you tonight may be sitting there and say,

282
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,440
 all right, let's just address the reality of this.

283
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,040
 It sounds like that's socialism.

284
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,200
 Okay, sounds like what they're doing is socialism.

285
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
 Here's the difference.

286
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 This is not government mandated socialism, all right?

287
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,720
 This was people that were moved.

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,440
 They were motivated to do this.

289
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,680
 They weren't forced to do it.

290
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,640
 They said, we're moved by something, by someone,

291
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,280
 and we're gonna give everything

292
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,160
 so that all of us have everything in common

293
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,840
 and there is no needy person among them.

294
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
 And it marked them.

295
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,840
 This last weekend, I traveled to Gulf Shores, Alabama,

296
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 a road trip with four other friends

297
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
 who I went to college with,

298
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,440
 and we went east and went to Gulf Shores, Alabama.

299
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,920
 You know how you can identify someone

300
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 who is from Gulf Shores, Alabama?

301
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,440
 By their Southern accent and their mullet.

302
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,960
 And I'm just kidding.

303
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
 No, I'm just kidding.

304
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
 But I mean, not a comedian.

305
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
 Thought that would work.

306
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
 Anyways, but what, truly though,

307
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,480
 we were on the beach and we're like, man,

308
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
 I mean, you could tell immediately

309
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,720
 when people would open their mouths

310
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,520
 and you'd see three missing teeth.

311
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
 I'm just kidding there too.

312
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 Just kidding there too.

313
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
 Love Alabama, love Alabama.

314
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
 No, but they would open their mouth

315
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,640
 and they'd speak and you'd hear this twang, right?

316
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,360
 You hear this Southern twang and you'd be like,

317
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,160
 I know where your home is.

318
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,200
 I know where you're from.

319
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
 And I'm not from that home, right?

320
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
 And in the same way, in the same way,

321
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,320
 people of God, just like the people of Alabama

322
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,600
 are marked by their accents,

323
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,560
 the people of God are marked,

324
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,560
 identified obviously by their radical generosity.

325
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,340
 And you can tell where their home is.

326
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,720
 You can tell where they're from.

327
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,400
 That it just doesn't make sense

328
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,560
 that they just might not be from this place

329
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,280
 and that they live in a way that's different.

330
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 I wanna ask you tonight, are you marked by generosity?

331
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,040
 Like if you thought about it

332
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,640
 and you had actually the courage to ask your friend

333
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,280
 who you came with and you said,

334
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,840
 hey, is generosity something that marks me?

335
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,680
 Like when you're describing me to people,

336
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,900
 are you just describing my hair color and how tall I am?

337
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,300
 Or is generosity a descriptive word

338
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,140
 or a concept that you would mention

339
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,100
 when you're telling others about me?

340
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,980
 Is generosity the fact that you are willing

341
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,760
 to give things away normal and in your life?

342
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,300
 The concept was so foreign to us,

343
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,220
 is so foreign to us of what the early church was like.

344
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,260
 It's almost like we just don't even have a category for it.

345
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,420
 But I think the reason why it's even more foreign

346
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,180
 is because we've lowered the bar.

347
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,500
 We've lowered the bar of generosity.

348
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,260
 I've asked people lately over this last month,

349
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
 these three questions and I'd love to ask them to you.

350
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
 These are the three questions

351
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,220
 that I've asked people in conversation.

352
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
 I've asked coworkers, roommates, close friends,

353
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,540
 college friends, you name it, poor cheese.

354
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,020
 All the people that on Tuesday,

355
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,420
 I will literally just ask people these questions.

356
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,100
 And it's this, do you think that you're generous?

357
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,260
 Question number one, do you think you're generous?

358
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,220
 Number two, do you think that others would think

359
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,940
 that you're generous?

360
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,100
 Question number three,

361
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,700
 do you think that God thinks that you're generous?

362
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,940
 And you know what's crazy?

363
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,060
 As I asked all sorts of different circles of people,

364
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,620
 I got similar answers, similar answers.

365
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,900
 Most people would say, generically, yes,

366
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,940
 I think I'm generous.

367
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,180
 I don't know whether or not

368
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
 I think my friends think I'm generous

369
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,980
 and probably not.

370
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,300
 I don't think that God thinks that I'm generous.

371
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,740
 But here's what was even crazier

372
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,660
 is when I would ask why and I'd say,

373
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,740
 hey, why do you think that?

374
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,900
 The answers were insanely different

375
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,260
 in the logic that people will say,

376
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,940
 hey, this is why I think I'm different.

377
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,220
 See if you see yourself in any of these.

378
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,580
 Some answers that I got

379
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,980
 on why people thought they were different.

380
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,500
 I think I'm generous because I give more

381
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,260
 than the average person.

382
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,220
 According to what I know,

383
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,300
 I think I give a little bit more.

384
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,860
 I think I'm generous because I live on less means

385
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
 than other people, relatively.

386
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,140
 I save more than most people.

387
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,380
 I think, you know, I'm a saver,

388
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,780
 so I spend less on myself.

389
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,060
 And so I think I'm generous because of that.

390
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,380
 Here's one of my favorites.

391
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,540
 I think I'm generous because I started doing

392
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,380
 my girlfriend's laundry.

393
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,700
 I literally had someone tell me that.

394
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,620
 I think I'm generous because I've started

395
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,140
 to do my girlfriend's laundry.

396
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,020
 I give great birthday presents.

397
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,700
 I think that I'm generous because I am the best

398
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,580
 at giving great birthday presents

399
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,780
 on the birthdays that I remember.

400
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,380
 I think that I'm generous because I walk

401
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,340
 my neighbor's dog sometimes.

402
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,540
 You know, like when they're out of town,

403
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,020
 like I'll walk him once or twice.

404
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,940
 I think I'm generous.

405
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,020
 I usually say yes when people ask for money.

406
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,220
 Or maybe this is you.

407
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,540
 When I'm at CVS and they ask after I've purchased something

408
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,820
 if you'd like to donate a dollar,

409
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,340
 I always say yes, that's me.

410
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,300
 I always do that, right?

411
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,500
 And someone that was like, hey,

412
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,820
 when they always ask for that SPCA,

413
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,740
 like I help the stray kittens, I'm always there.

414
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,940
 I say yes every time, saving it $1 at a time.

415
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
 That's me, I'm generous.

416
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,260
 And we look at what the Bible says, right?

417
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,740
 And they're giving fields, houses,

418
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
 their various essentials away,

419
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,340
 and we're doing laundry and we're calling it generous.

420
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,860
 And it's just like, man, maybe they aren't the crazy ones.

421
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,820
 Maybe they aren't crazy and for us to think

422
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,980
 that they were living a generous life,

423
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,860
 maybe we're the crazy ones and our standard is embarrassing,

424
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,820
 embarrassingly low.

425
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,260
 We're the richest people in all of human history

426
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,860
 by all historical accounts.

427
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,420
 And when we look at the first century church that was poor,

428
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,460
 it's like we're playing on a different scoreboard, right?

429
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,300
 Almost all examples that we have in reference

430
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,140
 to our generosity are giving in excess.

431
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,140
 And everything that they were doing was giving

432
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,140
 sacrificially out of need, out of what they had to live.

433
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,940
 And that's what marked them.

434
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,140
 So what does it look like for you today in 2018?

435
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,180
 What does it look like for us to be generous,

436
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,900
 to give sacrificially?

437
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,580
 Let's look together at what Paul says

438
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,860
 to the words of Timothy, which are found in 1 Timothy.

439
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,460
 Chapter six, Paul says this,

440
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,220
 "As for the rich in this day, which is you and I,

441
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,980
 "by all historic accounts, even if you don't feel like it,

442
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,500
 "that's us.

443
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
 "As for the rich in this day,

444
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,260
 "charge them not to be haughty,

445
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,820
 "nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,

446
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,580
 "but on God, who richly provides us

447
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
 "with everything to enjoy.

448
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,660
 "They are to do good, to be generous.

449
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,300
 "They are to do good, be rich in good works,

450
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,540
 "to be generous, ready to share,

451
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,620
 "thus storing up treasure for themselves

452
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
 "as a good foundation for the future,

453
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,620
 "so that they may take hold of that which is truly life."

454
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,620
 The second point from the text tonight is this,

455
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,700
 true generosity is about how you live,

456
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,820
 not just the money you give.

457
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,140
 True generosity is about how you live,

458
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,060
 not just the money you give.

459
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,180
 There are three categories that the Bible

460
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,860
 gives with how we're to be rich towards God,

461
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,860
 and that's with our time, our talent, and our treasure.

462
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,300
 Our time, our talent, and our treasure.

463
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 And so we'll start with our time.

464
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,900
 We all have 24 hours in a day.

465
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,820
 We all seemingly have jam-packed calendars

466
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,140
 that need to be scheduled.

467
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,020
 How can you give your time?

468
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,060
 Maybe it looks like leading a Bible study

469
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,900
 of college students this summer.

470
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,740
 Maybe it looks like giving your time on Wednesday nights.

471
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,860
 Like I know so many of you already do,

472
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,260
 to helping disciple junior high and high school students.

473
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,340
 Maybe it looks like getting involved

474
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,260
 in different parts of our city,

475
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,500
 like South Dallas at Mercy Street, mentoring kids.

476
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,220
 How can you give your time that's not your own

477
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,700
 for other people generously?

478
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,860
 Let's look at talent.

479
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,540
 What unique experiences

480
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,420
 that only you have, giftings that only you have.

481
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,260
 We're at this stage of life

482
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,660
 where we probably have figured out

483
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
 whether we're good at singing or we're not good at singing.

484
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,300
 Whether we are gonna make it to professional sports or not.

485
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,260
 Whether we had an engineering path

486
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,300
 or we just can't get it right with the numbers.

487
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,660
 And we know what we're good at

488
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,980
 and we know the experiences that we've alone been given

489
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,340
 that we can use and utilize.

490
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,460
 Maybe you're a nurse.

491
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,620
 Maybe you serve at Quest Care, at a clinic nearby.

492
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,740
 In a way that I never could as a real estate broker.

493
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,860
 Maybe you're an attorney

494
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,340
 and you partner with some of my friends at ACT

495
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,180
 and you help rewrite and reshape the judicial system

496
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,460
 in our city, here locally.

497
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,260
 And help those who are unable to help themselves.

498
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,420
 Maybe you're like some of the artists here

499
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,860
 that have given their time

500
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,940
 to make everything that you see tonight,

501
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,300
 exceptionally great.

502
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,580
 That you have no idea about.

503
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,860
 You just got excited about that launch video.

504
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,100
 You just got excited about the bumper videos.

505
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,260
 All of the details that you see here.

506
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,300
 That's done by people who are paid to do that

507
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,860
 on a daily basis.

508
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,380
 And yet they're so sold out

509
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
 and they believe in the cause of Christ

510
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,660
 that they say, I wanna donate.

511
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,820
 I wanna give everything that I'm excellent at

512
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,740
 so that Jesus can be known

513
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,580
 and so that thousands can experience it.

514
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,860
 That's what people do here with their talent.

515
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,260
 What can you do?

516
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,060
 What do you have that you can give?

517
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,380
 And your treasure, somewhat self-explanatory

518
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,300
 and it goes without saying,

519
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,460
 but how are you distributing your money?

520
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,340
 How are you giving your funds to the kingdom of God?

521
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,340
 Are you giving your money to the kingdom of God?

522
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,780
 Are you actually doing it?

523
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,740
 Are you holding it?

524
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,700
 As I've said earlier,

525
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,220
 this is something that as I go through these things,

526
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,500
 when I went through these things,

527
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,620
 I thought I was generous and I kind of went in that order.

528
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,180
 And that's why I thought initially that I was generous

529
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,500
 because I said, you know what?

530
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,820
 I give my time.

531
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,220
 I serve here.

532
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,980
 I help out in different ways.

533
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,140
 I give my time.

534
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,260
 I know what I'm gifted at and I give that freely

535
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,780
 and I love to do it and it fires me up.

536
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,940
 And so I'm generous.

537
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,540
 And then that last part, treasure.

538
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,780
 And I said, I don't like to do that.

539
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,300
 If I was speaking to my preferences and being honest,

540
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,020
 I would much rather give $10,000 worth of my time

541
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,620
 than $10,000 of my dollars.

542
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,180
 I just don't wanna do it.

543
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,500
 It's the truth.

544
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,820
 I just don't wanna do that.

545
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,600
 And here's the reality that I need to confess to you guys

546
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
 is that I let that preference bleed into a faulty priority.

547
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,680
 That I, for the last year, just said,

548
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,080
 hey, because I do these things,

549
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,200
 because I give in these other ways,

550
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,000
 I am justified and exempt from giving financially.

551
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,120
 That was me.

552
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,360
 I neglected giving to this place

553
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,480
 because I said I already give of myself.

554
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,420
 And so they don't need my dollars.

555
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,480
 They already have my time.

556
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,360
 And I wanna tell you, God wasn't missing out.

557
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,640
 I was.

558
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,160
 I was missing out.

559
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,640
 For as much joy as it gives me to give my time

560
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,760
 and my talents, it gives me joy

561
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
 when I give my money as well.

562
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,800
 I can tell you that where your treasure goes,

563
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
 your heart will go also.

564
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,240
 I know that.

565
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,560
 And yet for some reason, for some reason, for a long time,

566
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,920
 I said not here.

567
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,520
 And I made excuses.

568
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,200
 I made excuses.

569
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,560
 And that changed this last weekend

570
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,000
 in Gulf Shores, Alabama, of all places.

571
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,200
 I went with those friends and we talked about our money.

572
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,320
 And we said, what do we have?

573
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,540
 And what are we doing with it?

574
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,440
 We asked the questions.

575
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,280
 What are we gonna do with the money that God has given us?

576
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,000
 And I got to confess to my friends and say,

577
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,520
 guys, I don't think I'm doing it right.

578
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,240
 And it's not because I see that y'all are.

579
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,820
 I see that God has given me so much

580
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,800
 and that for some reason there is a mistranslation.

581
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,920
 That for some reason, I don't fully grasp who God is

582
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
 and the generosity He's given

583
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,360
 because I'm holding something back.

584
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
 And I get to confess that.

585
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
 And I got to make a change and make a plan

586
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,040
 and gather accountability and take a step

587
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,320
 and actually click the button and actually give dollars.

588
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,160
 And we got to do that together.

589
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,620
 And it was amazing.

590
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,120
 So maybe you can follow that process.

591
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,280
 Maybe it's not money, but it's anything else

592
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
 that if you're sitting here and you're like, man,

593
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,320
 I recognize that I am withholding something.

594
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,400
 That God's not demanding, but He's asking,

595
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,520
 He's saying, if you want to live the abundant life,

596
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
 it's found through giving, not getting.

597
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,320
 And maybe for you, if you are recognizing some area of that,

598
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,680
 a great next step is to gather people around

599
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
 and confess that.

600
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,280
 And to say, I'm not living as I should.

601
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,240
 I'm not living as I say I should.

602
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,160
 And I want to tell you what's going on.

603
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,200
 And I want to do something about it.

604
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 I want to change and gather accountability

605
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,180
 and lock arms with people that are going to help point you

606
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,140
 in a different direction.

607
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,900
 The reality is I didn't have a behavior problem

608
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,740
 this last year.

609
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,880
 I had a belief problem.

610
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
 There was a fault in my belief that I didn't fully

611
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,840
 understand the goodness of God.

612
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,040
 And so let's take a look at the why of generosity,

613
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,800
 the belief behind the behavior.

614
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,560
 And it comes from 2 Corinthians 8, verse nine.

615
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,320
 Paul is writing to this church in Corinth.

616
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
 It's culturally like modern day Las Vegas.

617
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,900
 He calls them to be, the church isn't,

618
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,560
 the city is where that church is.

619
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,520
 And he calling them to be generous.

620
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
 And this is what he says in verse nine.

621
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,840
 He says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus,

622
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,880
 that though He was rich, yet for your sake, He became poor,

623
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,560
 so that you by His poverty might become rich."

624
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,520
 My last point tonight from the text is that true generosity

625
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,440
 is a response to God's generosity.

626
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,440
 True generosity is a response to God's generosity.

627
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,080
 Paul's point here is that because you know the generosity

628
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,780
 of Jesus, because of what He's done,

629
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,600
 He's associating our act with an act that's already been done

630
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,940
 before us and to us.

631
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,300
 He's saying the why of giving is because someone else

632
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,380
 has given to you.

633
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,980
 You know what he does not say?

634
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,020
 He doesn't say you give to earn your way to heaven.

635
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,060
 Bible doesn't say that.

636
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,140
 He doesn't say you give because it makes you feel

637
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,180
 really good.

638
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,740
 Doesn't say that.

639
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,340
 It didn't say you give so that you get a tax write-off

640
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,640
 and a benefit financially.

641
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,520
 He does not say that.

642
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,900
 He says you give because of what Jesus has given to you.

643
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,220
 That God, very God of very God, became man.

644
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,180
 He took on human flesh and He gave you His very life.

645
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,460
 And in response to that, not as a requirement,

646
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,300
 but in response, you give your life freely to Him.

647
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,900
 And so in summary, true generosity marks the people of God.

648
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,740
 True generosity is about the life that you live,

649
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,080
 not just the money that you give.

650
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,080
 And true generosity is a response to God's generosity.

651
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,860
 I wanna close with a story that I found

652
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,140
 that was just mind blowing to me

653
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,420
 that really relates to this third point

654
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,360
 and then the overall message.

655
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,340
 It's about a guy two or three weeks ago,

656
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,260
 about a guy named James Harrison.

657
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,060
 I don't know if you read it much about Australians,

658
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,960
 but this guy's an Australian guy.

659
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,960
 And when he was a teenager in the '60s, 1960s,

660
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,440
 he had a life and death moment

661
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,040
 where he had to go into some really intense surgery.

662
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,320
 Wasn't gonna make it.

663
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,200
 They needed someone to donate blood.

664
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 And some anonymous person decided to donate their blood

665
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,280
 and it saved James Harrison's life.

666
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,760
 He was so moved by that reality

667
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,700
 that someone he didn't even know

668
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,880
 would give their very life for his.

669
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,980
 And so he said, man, I wanna give in response to that.

670
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,480
 I wanna give because someone's shown amazing kindness to me.

671
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
 Shortly thereafter, there was a problem in Australia

672
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,400
 where a lot of the expecting mothers,

673
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,180
 pregnant women in the country,

674
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,960
 a part of the complications that were happening at that time

675
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
 these medical experts said,

676
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,820
 hey, I think your blood type, you have a unique blood type.

677
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,760
 And I think that it might be the solution to this problem.

678
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,900
 Would you give that?

679
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,640
 And he said, absolutely.

680
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,640
 And so he gave his blood once a week for 60 years.

681
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,720
 60 years straight.

682
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,640
 The only reason we know about this story

683
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,960
 is because two weeks ago, he retired from giving blood.

684
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,200
 And it wasn't even because he chose to.

685
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,320
 It was because by Australian law,

686
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,140
 you can't give blood past 81 years old.

687
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,440
 Insanity, right?

688
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,280
 Insanity.

689
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,440
 And so they flip back and they say,

690
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,120
 man, this guy's given for how, 60 years.

691
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,500
 How, every week.

692
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,520
 Oh my gosh.

693
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,680
 And they roll back the tape and they recognize and realize

694
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,400
 that James Harrison, through his blood donations,

695
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,400
 saved 2.4 million babies with his blood.

696
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,840
 One of which was his own granddaughter.

697
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,680
 And you listen to that and you're like,

698
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,320
 oh my gosh, it's amazing.

699
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,820
 2.4 million lives, I could never do that.

700
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,200
 Or you're like, 2.4 million lives,

701
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,840
 I wanna save that tomorrow.

702
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,640
 I wanna do something great now.

703
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,440
 I don't wanna wait 60 years when I'm 81 and old

704
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,840
 and boring, I wanna do that now.

705
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,800
 And the reality is, it probably wasn't that sexy

706
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,560
 showing up every week, having your arm inserted

707
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,560
 with a needle and taking a little bit of blood.

708
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,120
 It probably wasn't that impressive.

709
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,760
 It probably wasn't that exciting,

710
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,600
 but consistent faithfulness over a long period of time,

711
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,040
 yielded an amazing impact.

712
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,720
 And if you are impressed by an 80 year old man

713
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,840
 who saved 2.4 million babies because of his blood,

714
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 then you need to know the man that has saved

715
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,160
 more than that by a long shot.

716
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,680
 Offering salvation with his blood by a long shot.

717
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,440
 Ultimate Jesus juke here.

718
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,440
 But Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ came to earth

719
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,280
 and he came and he offered his life completely.

720
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,760
 He lived a perfect life.

721
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,560
 And he said, I wanna give it for people that don't know me

722
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,360
 and that won't respond to me.

723
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,600
 I'm gonna give it to them anyways.

724
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
 I'm gonna give them everything.

725
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,240
 I'm not just gonna give some of my blood

726
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,000
 that's gonna be a benefit to them

727
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,400
 so that they can have a better life.

728
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
 I'm gonna give my entire self

729
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,440
 so that they can live with me for eternity.

730
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,360
 He offers that freely and he wants you to know him,

731
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,480
 not as a requirement so you'll feel guilty and obligated

732
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,680
 like you have to pay a God tax

733
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,460
 and give some of your money away,

734
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,520
 but so that you will experience the life

735
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,320
 that he intended for you,

736
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,940
 that you will experience the life of generosity

737
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,360
 that when you give,

738
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,520
 you will realize it's more blessed to do so

739
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,240
 than to receive.

740
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,040
 And so my plea for you tonight

741
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,520
 is that for those who don't know that,

742
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,120
 that you would look at the cross,

743
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,400
 that you would look at Jesus and you would realize,

744
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,920
 man, there's something that that guy did.

745
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,040
 And inside of my messed up brokenness,

746
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,960
 this guy pursues to know me

747
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,320
 and offers me more than the prestige of Dallas ever could

748
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,600
 or success in my 20s and 30s ever will.

749
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,260
 And I want you to see the cross and see his generosity,

750
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,640
 that he is infinitely more generous

751
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,000
 than James Harrison ever will be.

752
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,220
 And he offers that to you who he knows.

753
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,640
 And for those in the room tonight

754
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,720
 who do know that generosity,

755
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,160
 who do know that kindness that was shown to you,

756
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,960
 I hope that this motivates you.

757
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,040
 I hope that this,

758
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,980
 that further just convicts and stirs your heart and says,

759
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,680
 man, I want to give more of myself.

760
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,160
 I wanna be more of a river and less of a reservoir.

761
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,040
 I don't wanna hold on to stuff anymore.

762
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,640
 I wanna let it go through

763
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,800
 because that's what God's called me to.

764
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,220
 That's the life that he's offered us,

765
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,600
 that he has died for.

766
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,560
 Let me pray for us.

767
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,320
 Thank God I pray for my friends.

768
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,680
 I pray that we would know

769
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,400
 that there is nothing that we can do to please you.

770
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
 There's no amount of money that we can give away

771
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,760
 that's gonna wow you.

772
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,520
 You don't ask for money, God.

773
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,120
 You want us to respond to your generosity.

774
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,500
 You are the giver.

775
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,520
 It's not us, it's you.

776
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
 So I pray for my friends in the room

777
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
 that they would know that generosity,

778
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,320
 that they would respond to it,

779
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,180
 that they would not do so in isolation,

780
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,600
 that they wouldn't just say, man,

781
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,320
 generosity is this lifestyle and virtue

782
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,520
 that I practice on my own.

783
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,720
 I pray that they would realize

784
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,160
 that it is best practice in community.

785
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,360
 And I pray that they would experience the fullness of life,

786
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,520
 that they would realize that it is better to give

787
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,200
 than to receive,

788
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
 and that things would change tonight,

789
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,640
 that plans would be made,

790
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,080
 and that action steps would be taken.

791
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,300
 I pray that tonight.

792
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,600
 It's your name we pray, all these things, God, amen.

793
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:57,600
