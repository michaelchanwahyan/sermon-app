[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.480]   He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.400]   He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.080]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.360]   are with me.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.400]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.080]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.760]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.400]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.680]   in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.000]   What's up Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.640]   Hey my name is Timothy Atik and I'm one of the teaching pastors here on Sunday mornings
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.800]   in here at the Porch.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.280]   If this is your first time with us, I am so glad that you made it.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760]   Welcome here in the room and also to everyone watching online.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520]   I want to say hello to Porch Life, Des Moines and Tulsa, Boise, Scottsdale.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.040]   So glad that you are tuning in tonight.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.800]   It is a really important night because we're starting a new series.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.080]   It's going to last about five weeks and we are walking through the most famous chapter
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.800]   in the entire Bible.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   So even if you're new to the Bible or new to Christianity, the chances of you having
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.120]   heard the 23rd Psalm are very, very high.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000]   And so I'm so glad that you made it.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.280]   It's going to be a great series.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.200]   I want to start just by sharing with you that when I started dating my wife, Catherine,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.400]   on our third date, I took her to the State Fair of Texas.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   So when we were at the State Fair, I decided that there's no better way to get to know
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.280]   someone than by riding the Texas Skycoaster, which is the crane that lifts you up 189 feet
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.440]   in the air while you're strapped together in a harness.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.240]   And then you pull a cord and it drops you and you swing through the sky.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.520]   The reason that I wanted to do that with Catherine is because you can learn a lot about someone
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.240]   at 189 feet in the air.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   Because if you just put yourself in a position where you have no control, who you really
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.520]   are comes out.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   And so if you want to know who someone is, just put them in a place where they feel little
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.960]   control at 189 feet in the air.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.840]   I'll just tell you what Catherine learned about me while we were hanging in the sky.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.720]   As we were being lifted into the air, I didn't choose to do this.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.480]   I just did this involuntarily.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.560]   I just began to sing.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.120]   It's just what apparently I do when I feel no control.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   So as we were being lifted up, here's what I did.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   I go, "It's a beautiful day.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   Skies are all afield."
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.120]   That's a U2 song from a long time ago.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.640]   If you're like U-Hoo, U2, they'll change your life.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   Anyway, that's what I did while we were being raised up.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.520]   And then when I pulled the cord and we began to swing through the sky, I began to Christian
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   cuss.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.200]   I was going to seminary at the time.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.560]   And so I just began to scream, "Oh my gentle Judas!"
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.360]   That is what came out of my mouth.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   That's what happens when Timothy Atik is not in control.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.840]   And I tell you that because as we start this new series, it's just good to think about
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.740]   where you're at in life right now.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.440]   And I just want you to think, what is the area of your life right now where you feel
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.480]   little to no control?
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.020]   Is there an area of your life where you feel little to no control?
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.760]   What is the one area of your life where you can't exactly see if everything is going to
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   work out?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.880]   For you, it might be your relationship status.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760]   It might be your job status.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640]   It might be your financial status.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.160]   It could be your physical health status.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.720]   I don't know what it is for you.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.200]   But if you feel little to no control over a certain area of your life, I just wonder
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.120]   if we bought the video of your life's skycoaster, what would we see you doing as you grasp for
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   control?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   Because it's interesting, when people are being raised up on that Texas skycoaster,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.440]   it's like they begin hugging themselves, like grabbing onto the harness is going to do something.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.400]   And when we feel out of control, we begin to panic.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.920]   And so if you feel out of control in your relationship status, you might quickly settle
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.600]   for the wrong person because you're nervous that it's not going to work out.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   Like the wedding circuit has already passed through one round, and more and more of your
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.320]   friends are getting married, but you're not.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   Or maybe you're just in that place where you're in your second job right out of college.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.720]   You've already gone through one, and you're getting that three, four, five-month itch
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.960]   where you're like, "You know what?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.400]   This just isn't my dream job.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.960]   I'm just not that happy.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.800]   I need to start looking for something else."
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.000]   I don't know what it is for you.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   Maybe you have a struggle with pornography, and the reason that you're struggling with
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.760]   pornography, it's a control issue.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.920]   You're like, "I have no clue that that is why I'm looking at porn."
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's because you're scared of rejection, and so you can slip into a fantasy world, and
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.520]   there is no rejection.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.600]   It's the one place where you can control every aspect of your sexual experience.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.000]   And so it's just good for us to dial in.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Like if there is a video of the skycoaster of your life, whatever that area is of your
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.920]   life where you feel little to no control, how do you panic?
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   Like what does it look like for you to panic?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.040]   And what I want to do tonight is I just want to show you that there's a better way.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.320]   We're looking at the most famous chapter in the Bible, and it was written by a guy named
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.960]   David.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.880]   If you're new to the Bible, I guarantee you there's a good chance that you know something
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   about David.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.120]   David's the guy who slayed the giant with a sling and a stone.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.680]   And David writes this psalm, and listen to how he starts it.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.520]   He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.120]   Another translation puts it this way, "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.520]   Another translation puts it this way, "The Lord is my shepherd, I have all that I need."
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.120]   And you might be sitting there saying, "Yeah, but he was king.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.320]   Of course he had all that he needs."
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.720]   You just need to know exactly who's writing this.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.560]   David had some high highs.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.040]   Yes, he was king.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   Yes, he did conquer a giant, but David also lived on the run for 15 years.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.240]   Like he didn't sleep in his own bed for 15 years.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.840]   He was hiding out in caves because the current king was trying to kill him.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.740]   His best friend was killed.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.800]   His daughter was raped.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.160]   Four of his sons died prematurely.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.040]   He had to lead his country through a multiple year famine.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:47.280]   And yet that guy is able to say, "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.360]   And so what I'm trying to get you to understand is that David walked through life with peace,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   but that peace wasn't because of what he had.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   That peace was because of who had him.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.800]   And so what I want to do is I want to invite you from panic to peace.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.420]   Like whatever area of your life feels out of control, the good news is this, you don't
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.360]   have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.880]   And so I am inviting you from panic to peace tonight.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.080]   The key is to know God as shepherd.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.000]   David says, "The Lord is my shepherd."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Have you ever thought, what does David mean when he says that the Lord is my shepherd?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.320]   Like if we're not careful, we'll just blaze right past that.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.960]   But we have to take the time to understand what does it mean that the Lord is our shepherd?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.040]   That's a tough analogy because, I mean, maybe there's like one person in here who's spent
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.600]   some time around some sheep, but for the rest of us, it's kind of not our thing.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.840]   Like we're not very familiar with sheep.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.480]   And so the analogy doesn't connect, but for David, it did connect.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   Like you need to understand the reason that David used the imagery of the shepherd was
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.680]   because David's dad was a shepherd, but it wasn't just that David's dad was a shepherd,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   David was a shepherd.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.160]   And it's not just that David was a shepherd of sheep, kings in the ancient near east were
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.200]   referred to as shepherd kings.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.240]   So David shepherded the nation of Israel when he was king.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.920]   But not only that, David was written into God's story.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.200]   And in the old Testament, if you were to read the old Testament, you would see that God
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   is pictured as a shepherd of his people.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.000]   That's why Psalm 78, 52 says, "Then he," that's God, "led out his people like sheep and guided
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.240]   them in the wilderness like a flock."
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.640]   So when David used this analogy, it's like a football coach using a football analogy.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.760]   Nothing makes more sense.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:09.680]   In fact, David wrote just a little over half of the Psalms.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.440]   And up until this point, when he refers to God as shepherd, it's the most intimate analogy
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.280]   that he has used of God to this point.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.920]   Very intimate for David.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.880]   But if we're not careful, we'll just blow past the beauty of God being our shepherd.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.760]   But peace is found in knowing God as shepherd.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.160]   What I hope you see tonight is this.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.200]   Here's the key, don't miss it.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.240]   His identity, God's identity as shepherd brings peace to our reality.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.840]   So whatever your reality is right now, whatever feels out of control for you, wherever you're
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:55.160]   hitting the panic button, his identity brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activity.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.320]   So who he is informs how we live.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.000]   His identity brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activity.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.280]   So we want to dial into what it means when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd."
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.520]   And the reason that we need to fight for clarity is because Jesus actually picks up the imagery
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.960]   of the shepherd in John 10 verse 11, when he says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.040]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.000]   So here at the porch, our hope is that you would see Jesus clearly.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.680]   By us understanding what David means when he refers to God as shepherd, we will see
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:43.360]   Jesus more clearly because Jesus picks up the analogy and calls himself the good shepherd.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.280]   When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," I believe that he is saying at least five
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.700]   things.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.880]   And I want you to understand God's identity so that it will bring peace to your reality
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.480]   and clarity to your activity.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.720]   First, when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," I believe that David is saying, "The Lord
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560]   is my leader."
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.720]   The Lord is my leader.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   Why do I say that?
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.280]   Well, look at the verbs that David uses as he continues in the psalm.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   He starts out in verse one of Psalm 23.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.480]   He says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   Verse two, watch this.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.000]   "He makes me lie down in green pastures."
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Now watch the verb.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.760]   "He leads me beside still waters.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.520]   He restores my soul.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.240]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake."
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.920]   God is leader.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:36.600]   In the ancient Near East, shepherds didn't drive their sheep from behind like Western
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.000]   shepherds do.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.580]   No, the shepherd would go in front of the sheep and the sheep would follow the shepherd
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.580]   as the leader.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.960]   When David says that God is leader, here's what that means for God to be leader.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   It means that he is in charge of the path and the pace.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.760]   He's in charge of where we go and how fast we get there.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.560]   So think about David's life.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.360]   If you don't know much about David, he was told that he would become king of the nation
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.080]   of Israel at around the age of 15.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.200]   Do you know what age he actually became king?
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.040]   At the age of 30.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.440]   So for a 15 year period, do you know what the path was?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.880]   The path was being on the run from the outgoing king trying to kill him.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.160]   What was the pace?
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.840]   15 years.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.680]   When God led the nation of Israel like a flock, what was the path?
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.960]   It was wandering around in the desert.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.600]   What was the pace?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.880]   40 years.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.440]   God is in charge of the path and the pace.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.560]   Another way to say it is God is in charge of the where's and the when's of our lives.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.480]   And the reason that that is so important for us to identify is that the majority of the
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:03.960]   questions that we are asking that cause us stress either start with where or when.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.800]   When am I going to finally meet someone?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.360]   When and where am I going to meet my people in Dallas?
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   Where am I supposed to get plugged in?
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.760]   Where am I going to live?
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.040]   Where am I going to work?
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.720]   Where am I supposed to invest?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.580]   When am I going to get out of debt?
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.040]   When am I going to start feeling better?
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   When am I going to get a better job?
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   When am I going to finally figure out what I'm supposed to do with my life?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.440]   It's the where's and the when's that cause us stress.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.000]   These are questions about the path and the pace.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.760]   If you are frustrated with God right now, you're probably frustrated about his leadership
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.680]   because he's in charge of the path and the pace.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.520]   You don't like where he's leading you and how fast he is leading you there.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:06.480]   We moved to Dallas from College Station right at the end of 2021.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.920]   So we showed up to Dallas basically January 2nd of 2022.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.240]   And I'm just being straight up honest with you guys, 2022 was the hardest year of my
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   life.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.360]   Hardest year of my life.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.520]   We loved our lives in College Station.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.560]   We loved the ministry that we were a part of in College Station.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.240]   We were content in College Station and God interrupted our lives and he called us to
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   Dallas.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   Like, it was just so abundantly clear that we were supposed to leave what we were doing
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.480]   in College Station and come to Dallas.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.720]   And we came to Dallas.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.400]   And man, we just faced one challenge after another.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.560]   We had housing issues.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.240]   We had schooling issues.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.840]   We had significant issues on several different fronts.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.080]   Some stuff if I share with you, you'd be like, that's crazy.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   Truly.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:12.400]   And there were moments during 2022 where I found myself talking to God as honestly
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.520]   as I could saying, why did you call us here?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   Do you know what it is a question of?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.640]   It is a question of the path.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   God, I don't like the path that you have us on.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.400]   I like the place where you had us and now you're leading us on this path which is filled
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.680]   with trials, filled with heartache, filled with confusion.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.400]   It's a question about the path.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.280]   Fortunately in 2023, he's led us to greener pastures.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:50.600]   But man, I know what it is like to struggle with the path or the pace.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.280]   But I still remember sitting right there on that front row during a worship service and
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.920]   we began to sing the goodness of God.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.640]   And it says, your goodness is running after me.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.200]   That's a line from Psalm 23.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.400]   And it was in that moment that I realized that all of 2022, the hardest year of my life,
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.320]   God's goodness was chasing me the entire time.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.320]   Which is pretty cool to think that God was going before me because he was my leader.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.280]   And yet somehow he was coming behind me with his goodness.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.120]   And so I was able to trust him as my leader, even though I didn't like the path and I didn't
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.360]   like the pace.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.280]   Some of you guys are trying to decide if you should trust God's leadership by looking at
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.000]   the path and the pace.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   But you've got to flip it.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.960]   You have to learn to trust the path and the pace from looking at the leader.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.240]   Don't look, don't flip it.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   Don't figure out if you'll trust the leader by looking at the path and the pace.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.560]   Look at the leader so that you know you can trust the path and the pace.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.680]   You can trust the character of God.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   God's identity informs our activity.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.120]   He is leader.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.000]   So we follow.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.640]   When David says, the Lord is my shepherd, he is saying, the Lord is my leader.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.920]   The second thing that David is saying when he says the Lord is my shepherd is he's saying
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.520]   the Lord is my owner.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.080]   Now that's weird wording.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   Where do I get that from in scripture?
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.880]   Okay, because I'm not just going to throw out opinions to you.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.320]   Like we stand on the word of God here at the porch because we think that God has gone to
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.800]   great lengths to give us his words.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.680]   So where I find that is in John chapter 10, which is the most thorough passage where Jesus
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.080]   picks up the analogy of being the shepherd.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.520]   He says in verse 11 that he is the good shepherd.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.480]   Now watch this in verse 12 of John chapter 10.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.760]   Jesus says, he who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, he who is a hired hand and not
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.360]   a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.600]   And the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.920]   He flees because he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   I'm the good shepherd.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.640]   I know my own and my own know me.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.560]   Jesus is talking about ownership.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.040]   He says, look, the hired hand, the hired hand does not what?
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   He does not own the sheep.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.440]   The shepherd owns the sheep.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.600]   To say that the Lord is my shepherd is to say the Lord is my owner.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.640]   Now I want you to see the correlation that Jesus makes between ownership and care.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:47.200]   Because he says that the hired hand doesn't own the sheep, but he says he flees because
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.680]   he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.160]   So because he doesn't own the sheep, he doesn't care about the sheep.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.840]   So the inverse must be true.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.280]   For the shepherd to own the sheep means that the shepherd cares about the sheep.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.040]   And here's the reality.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.360]   This is just the way things work in our world.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.880]   When you own something, you are the one who cares about it the most.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   That's the reality.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.200]   When you own something, no one cares more about it than you.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.400]   Like I'll give you an example from my life.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.720]   When we lived in College Station, I would drive to Houston to speak a lot.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.240]   And I left a speaking engagement.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.800]   It was on a Wednesday night.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.200]   I had not eaten dinner.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.840]   I was driving back to College Station.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.600]   It's about an hour and 15 minute drive.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.040]   And I was super hungry.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:47.000]   And so I Google Maps to Chick-fil-A. And so I found a Chick-fil-A on Highway 290 in Cyprus.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.120]   And it said that Chick-fil-A closed at 10 o'clock.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.240]   And my map was showing that I was going to arrive at 958.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.280]   So I was coming in hot, people.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.040]   Needed a 12 count, some sweet tea with two Chick-fil-A sauce and two ketchup.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.960]   So I'm coming in hot.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.560]   I come around the corner.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.040]   I come around the corner into the parking lot.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.080]   I can see the drive-thru at the end.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.160]   And I am making my way to the entrance of the drive-thru.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   And out of the corner of my left eye, I see a high school kid in a red shirt sprinting
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.000]   across the parking lot.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.440]   And I'm like, life goes into slow motion at that point where I'm like trying to figure
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.960]   out what is happening.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'm driving to the drive-thru.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   Small man in a red shirt sprinting across the parking lot.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.800]   And then I realized he's racing me.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   And he's trying to beat me there to put a cone in the entrance to keep me from getting
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.080]   my 12 count and the sweet tea.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.640]   So what did I do?
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.280]   I floored it.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.400]   I floored it across the parking lot.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   I beat him to the entrance.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   I rolled down my window.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.200]   I said, were you racing me?
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   He goes, yeah.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   I was like, cool, man.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   Sorry.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.760]   And I pulled around and I ordered.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.920]   But in that moment, do you know what I was reminded?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.280]   I was reminded that kid does not own Chick-fil-A. He doesn't.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.320]   He is not an owner.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.800]   Because I've interacted with multiple Chick-fil-A operators.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.080]   I've even had a chance to talk to Dan Cathy for two minutes.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:40.560]   And it is clear if you talk to someone who operates or owns Chick-fil-A, it is very clear
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   that they care about their customers and chicken.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.720]   They care deeply.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:54.360]   It is their pleasure to care about their people.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.440]   Because that's what owners do.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.200]   Owners care the most.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.240]   To know Jesus as your shepherd is to know the one who cares the most about your life.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.360]   So I just want to say something and it's just going to fly past some of you and then some
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.480]   of you it's going to hit you between the eyes and it's the one thing God brought you here
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.860]   to hear.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:26.300]   No one cares more about you than Jesus Christ.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:34.420]   Jesus Christ cares more about you than you care about you.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:42.900]   Like he cares more about you than even you care about yourself.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:51.260]   So that's why Peter's words in 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 7 should be what some of you take
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.020]   as your application for tonight.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.020]   Because what does he say?
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.180]   He says cast all your anxiety on him.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.380]   Why?
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.860]   Because he cares.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.140]   Because he cares for you.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.260]   Cast all of your anxiety.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.220]   So whatever that area is of your life where you can't see around the corner, you don't
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.540]   know how it's going to turn out, you can't control the outcome, whatever that thing is,
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.060]   cast all of it on his shoulders.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.540]   Take it off of your shoulders, drop it on his, his shoulders are far more sturdy than
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:30.820]   yours are, you can walk in freedom that you don't have to carry it because he cares for
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.500]   you.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.220]   The Lord is your owner.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.580]   But it's not just that the Lord is our leader or our owner.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.340]   Verse 3 when David says the Lord is my shepherd is he's saying the Lord is my provider.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.460]   He's my provider.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.020]   That's why David is able to say in verse 1 the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:55.140]   I shall not want, I lack nothing.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:01.260]   So remember the Old Testament positions God as a shepherd who led the nation of Israel
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.980]   like sheep.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.300]   Well God led them through the desert for 40 years.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.820]   How did God provide for them?
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.240]   Well he made a deal with them.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.700]   He said here's the deal.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:20.100]   If you want to eat, like if you want food to eat, here's how things are going to work
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.280]   in my economy.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.060]   You're going to wake up in the morning and there is magically going to be food for you
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   to eat.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.740]   It's just going to appear.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.980]   But only take what you need for that one day.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.700]   Don't save anything.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.300]   Don't store it up.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.940]   Don't get out any Tupperware and pack stuff up.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.700]   You eat what you need and then you trust that when you wake up the next morning there will
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.540]   be more food.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.620]   What did the Israelites do?
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.220]   They tried to stockpile it.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.860]   That's what we do.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:04.300]   They tried to stockpile it just in case God's buffet closed for cleaning one day.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.700]   And so it begins to get moldy and has bugs growing in it.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.740]   How long did God expect them to operate with that type of provision rhythm?
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:24.700]   Exodus 16, 35 says the people of Israel ate the manna 40 years.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.740]   For 40 years God expected the nation of Israel to just trust that when they woke up in the
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.200]   morning he as their good shepherd would provide for them.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.500]   It makes sense now that when Jesus teaches us to pray the Lord's Prayer, what does he
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.020]   teach us to pray?
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.900]   Give us this day our daily bread.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.340]   Like Jesus wants that type of relationship with us where we need him to daily show up
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.980]   and provide in our lives.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.140]   Here's the issue though that we have.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.660]   We believe that peace and joy is found in control.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.660]   Like we believe that our greatest peace and our greatest joy will be found when we feel
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.060]   in complete control.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.340]   And Jesus is like, no joy isn't found in control.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.840]   Joy is found in dependence.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:21.580]   Your greatest joy is found in Jesus showing up in significant ways in your life.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.880]   But we don't want to trust.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.920]   So just think about it, when the pandemic hit, like if you remember like the first week,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:37.000]   it was March 2020, like when the world went like, went bananas, like everyone lost their
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.920]   minds.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   What did everyone do?
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.800]   They went to the stores and what's the one thing everyone bought?
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.240]   Toilet paper.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.960]   People were like, I can't live without toilet paper.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.520]   Like I'm not going to lose a sock.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:57.760]   I am going to buy, I don't care if anyone else has something to use when they're going
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   to the bathroom, but I'm buying the whole shelf because if I've got to go into hibernation
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:12.660]   for the next decade, I'm going to have three squares per moment for 10 years.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.160]   And that's fine.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.360]   I mean, that's fine if a pandemic hits and you want to stockpile toilet paper and bottle
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.440]   water, you can.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.520]   But there are certain things you cannot stockpile in this life.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.600]   Like you can't just stockpile like job offers.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.640]   You can't just stockpile people who want to marry you.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   Can't just, some of you are like, I can, that's a problem.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.560]   Can't stockpile everything.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.920]   You will have to trust the Lord to provide.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.800]   And that's where joy is found.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:01.720]   So when we were moving from college station to Dallas, we decided like at the end of November,
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.880]   we were actually going to come to Dallas.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.320]   And then we decided we were going to try and get here for our kids to start school by January
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   2nd.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.840]   And some of you are like, oh man, that, that gave you a whole month to pack up the back
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   of your car and move.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.000]   No, people got three kids.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.400]   It, it took like two 26 foot long trucks to move the Atik family.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.920]   This isn't like popping the back window and just putting some stuff in.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.720]   So we found ourselves in a place where we needed to sell our house really quickly.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.160]   We needed to find a house really quickly and we needed, we were looking for a learning
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.360]   different school for one of our kids and we had none of those things.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.940]   We were trying to sell our house in two days before we were going to put it on the market.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:56.160]   Some guys came to fix our wood floors and this guy ruined, like we were trying to replace
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.920]   just two feet of wood from the door to here.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.800]   He started chopping wood back here and then I watched him stop and realize that he had
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.760]   made a mistake and we have this massive divot in our floor two days before we're going to
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.360]   put it on the market.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.720]   Then we tried to find a house to buy and it was at the point where the market was at the
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.920]   peak and there was nothing for sale.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.600]   And then I came to Dallas and I visited six different learning different schools for my
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.920]   kids and none of them were a fit.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.160]   So I called the public school and they were like, we don't have room for them.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   We'll have to send them to a different public school temporarily.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.480]   And I was like, God, what are you doing?
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.840]   Like this makes no sense.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.480]   You called us to go to Dallas.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.740]   I've got a divot in my floor.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:48.740]   We can't find a house to buy and there's no place to, not even the public school can take
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.180]   my kid.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.140]   And it put us in a place where God had to provide.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:31:01.660]   So God worked a miracle and some other wood company came, replaced the floor.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.860]   An elder at a church made a phone call and there just happened to be someone renting
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.260]   a house, few streets from the public school we were hoping to go to.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.380]   And then the public school called me back and said, we've got a space for your kid.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.800]   And each of those things happened in the short period of time.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.740]   And it was all the Lord just saying, wait and watch.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.820]   Don't panic.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.120]   Just wait and watch.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.900]   It makes me think of John chapter six, where Jesus feeds the 5,000.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.100]   He asked his disciples a question.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.900]   He says, where are we going to get enough food to feed all these people?
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.060]   And I love what the text says.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:49.380]   It says, he asked this knowing, he asked us to test them because he knew what he was going
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.460]   to do.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.140]   That's so encouraging.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.940]   He said this to test them, knowing what he was going to do.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.940]   I just wonder if there's times where God's like, oh my gosh, where are you going to get
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   a job?
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:10.220]   Where do you even get those?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:18.660]   And I just wonder how many moments in our life, like the, the parentheses reads, he
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.900]   said this to test you because he already knows what he's going to do.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:34.580]   Our job is to wait and watch, is to trust in our Lord who is provider.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.780]   Here is the reality, and I need you to hear this.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.820]   You might not always have what you want, but you will most certainly always have what you
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.580]   need.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.980]   You might not always have what you want.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   You might not.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.020]   You might not always have what you want, but you will most certainly always have what you
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.020]   need.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:03.700]   And some of you are like, wrong, wrong, because I don't have what I need right now.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.540]   And I would just say, you might not have what you think you need, but just remember Jesus
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   cares more about you than you care about you, which means God knows what you need more than
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.340]   you even know what you need.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:23.100]   So the fact that I know that he has given you what you need is explained by you being
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.620]   here tonight.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.860]   The fact that you're still standing.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.700]   Some of y'all might be like, but I'm hanging by a thread, but you're still hanging by a
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:42.220]   thread because God has given you this day's bread.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:48.020]   And tomorrow he will be enough for what you need tomorrow.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:53.300]   And if you ever question God as a provider, all you have to do is read what Jesus says
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.140]   in at the end of John 10, as he still uses the shepherd imagery.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.820]   He says, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.900]   Watch this verse 28.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.020]   I give them eternal life.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.820]   I give them eternal life.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.140]   They will never perish.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.780]   No one will snatch them out of my hand.
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.140]   My father who has given them to me is greater than all.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.260]   No one is able to snatch them out of the father's hand.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   He has given you what you need most.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.980]   What do you need most?
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.380]   Him.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:35.340]   Everything you need is found in having Jesus and being had by Jesus.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:41.500]   And when you put your faith in Jesus, he gives you eternal life, life with him.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.100]   So when David says, the Lord is my shepherd, he's saying the Lord is my leader, saying
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.420]   the Lord is my owner, the Lord is my provider, but he's also saying the Lord is my protector.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.580]   The Lord is my protector.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.640]   Remember the most famous story about David.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.140]   It's where he conquers Goliath.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.220]   Well, why was David even at the battlefield?
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:07.680]   Because David was about 18 years old at the time and you had to be 20 years old to fight
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.740]   in the army.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:17.180]   David was there because he was basically his dad's chicoterie board boy.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.440]   His dad, you're like, what does that even mean?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   What is that?
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.660]   And where do you get them?
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.280]   David's dad says, here's some cheese and some bread.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.460]   Go feed your brothers who are at war.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.100]   So he's basically the cart boy.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.260]   Shows up with some cheese and bread.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:42.740]   And while he's there, he hears Goliath taunting God's people.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.700]   He says, this is a problem.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.020]   I'm going to do something about it.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.680]   And so he goes and he stands before the king and tells the king that he wants to do something
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   about it.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.220]   And Saul, the king is like, look, you don't stand a chance.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.020]   You're a kid.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.020]   That guy's a champion.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.540]   He's a warrior.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.300]   Listen to what David says because he uses shepherd imagery and it gives us some explanation
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.940]   about what it means for the Lord to be our shepherd.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.700]   David said to Saul, your servant used to keep sheep for his father.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:18.660]   And when there came a lion or a bear and took a lamb from the flock, I went after him and
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.580]   I struck him and I delivered it out of his mouth.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.060]   And if he arose against me, I love this.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.780]   This is such a boss thing to say.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:31.260]   He says, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.420]   That is something I will never be able to say in my life.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.700]   Like I grabbed the beard of a lion and dropped him.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.860]   It's amazing.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.020]   But what's his point?
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.620]   His point is I'm the protector of my sheep.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:51.620]   So when David says the Lord is my shepherd, he's saying, you're my protector.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.740]   Just as I would protect my sheep, you protect me.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:01.140]   And when we know Jesus is our shepherd, he is our protector.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:06.020]   Because what David did to that lion is what Jesus has done to Satan, sin and death.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.700]   When Jesus Christ went to the cross and declared, it is finished.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.420]   And then when he was put in a tomb, and then especially when he walked out of that tomb,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:21.620]   it was him grabbing Satan, sin and death by the beard, striking them and killing them,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:29.180]   delivering the death blow that will resound throughout eternity.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.660]   Jesus Christ is our protector.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.940]   He went to the cross to deal a death blow to Satan, sin and death.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.460]   So the victory has already been won.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.580]   Like it's March Madness right now.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.620]   Satan is basically that guy who looks at the score, he's like, I've already lost, but I'm
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.980]   just going to foul as much as I can on the way out.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.980]   He's already lost.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:56.460]   He's just trying to foul until the end.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.580]   So my encouragement to you is to get behind Jesus, your protector.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.420]   You're like, well, what does that look like?
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:07.300]   Well, there's three practical ways that Jesus offers us protection.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.060]   Number one, he gives us his word.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.940]   He gives us his word so we can know his ways, so we can walk in his will.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.800]   And his will is described as being good, pleasing and perfect.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.320]   Number two, he gives us his spirit.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.740]   God actually comes and lives inside of us.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:32.820]   And the spirit of God is active and has every intention of living a life through us that
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:40.460]   is marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.900]   And then the last one's huge, self-control.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.620]   And then God has given us his people so we can gather here on Tuesday nights and Sunday
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.540]   mornings and we can remind ourselves of what is true, but then we can leave here and we
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.340]   can walk together through life and we can encourage each other.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:02.660]   We can go to battle for one another and we can hold each other up.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:07.540]   We can remind one another of what is true so that we can walk in victory.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.540]   He is our protector.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.260]   So if you feel beat down by sin right now, maybe you're living with the schema in your
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.860]   mind, I'm a failure.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.180]   There's no way out.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.380]   I will never break free from this.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.580]   What a lie from the pit of hell.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.220]   Because when you say, "I'll never be free from this," no, Jesus Christ, when you put
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:34.180]   your trust in him, he already freed you from the penalty of sin and he actually freed you
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.020]   from the power of sin.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.380]   It's just that we keep putting the chains back on.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.100]   And Jesus is saying, "No, drop them.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.820]   Take them off."
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.100]   But that might mean you changing your relationship with his word, changing your relationship
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.260]   with his spirit where you actually begin to wake up every day and say, "Spirit, fill me.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.260]   Fill me full.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.100]   Bear the fruit of self-control in my life."
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.740]   And it might mean changing your relationship with God's people where you allow yourself
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.660]   to be fully known and fully loved.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:12.820]   Finally, when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," he's also saying, "The Lord is
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.580]   my physician."
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.980]   The Lord is my physician.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.420]   There's a guy, Philip Keller, who wrote a book, "As a Shepherd."
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.580]   He himself is a shepherd.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.140]   He wrote a book on Psalm 23.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.700]   Here's what he said.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.900]   He said, "Sheep require more than any other class of livestock, endless attention and
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.420]   meticulous care."
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.700]   It's no accident that God has chosen to call us sheep.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.980]   The behavior of sheep and human beings is similar in many ways.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.540]   Our mass mind or mob instincts, our fears and timidity, our stubbornness and stupidity,
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:50.820]   our perverse habits are all parallels of profound importance.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.060]   When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd," he's saying, "Look, the Lord is my physician.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:02.500]   He is, he's the one who deals with the hurts and habits of my own life."
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.780]   And so let me just say this.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.400]   Like God sees you.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.780]   He sees all of you.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.540]   You can't hide from God.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.380]   You don't want to hide from God.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.940]   But God isn't coming for you in judgment.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   If you know him, he wants to bring you in and heal what is broken in your life.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:31.260]   And if you don't know him, like turn to him today.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.700]   Because if you don't, there will come a day of judgment.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:40.540]   But today he is inviting you into relationship with him and he wants to be your physician.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.260]   Because we all have things in our lives that are broken.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.460]   You're like, "What in my life is broken?"
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.460]   Let me ask you this.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:53.700]   If, if everything you do, the clothes that you wear, the way that you talk, the car that
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:42:00.340]   you drive, if it is all to win people's approval, can't we agree there's something broken with
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.580]   that?
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:11.580]   Like if, if, if it does not take much for you to lose control of your temper and you
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:17.420]   rage like on a dime, can't we agree there's, there's something, there's something broken
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   there?
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.500]   If, if you look in the mirror and all you see is something negative, you only see the
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.180]   negatives in your life.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.860]   Can't we agree there, there's something broken there?
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.940]   If you regularly lie, exaggerate, or tell half-truths about who you are, what you have,
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.740]   or what you've done to make yourself look better than you really are, can't we agree
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:43.380]   there's something, there's something busted there?
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:54.700]   If you use guys or you use girls to make yourself feel significant, invaluable, you're using
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.700]   another person.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.820]   Can't we agree there, there's something busted, broken there?
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:05.180]   If you continue to do things that you don't want to do, you continually run to porn or
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.940]   alcohol or drugs or whatever it is for you, can't we agree there's something broken there?
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:16.860]   I don't say that to shame you, I, I say that to call you to your good shepherd who wants
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.300]   to be your physician.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.700]   And we all have something broken and we all need healing.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.180]   And it is his joy to heal us.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.580]   God wants you to know him as your shepherd.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:35.860]   His identity is what brings peace to our reality and clarity to our activities.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.620]   So because he is leader, look, because he is leader, we don't have to figure out the
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.280]   future now.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.020]   We don't.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:50.700]   Because he is owner, we can rest tonight in the fact that he cares more than we care about
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.700]   ourselves.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.100]   Because he is provider, we can rest in the fact that we might not always have what we
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.860]   want, but we will certainly always have what we need.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:10.580]   Because, because he is protector, we can, we can look to his provision for us, of his
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.620]   word, of his spirit, of his people, and we can take steps towards victory.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:25.020]   And because he is physician, we can step out of brokenness into healing.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.900]   Would you know your good shepherd tonight?
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.820]   And then I'll, I'll finish just by saying this.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:36.740]   Some of you tonight, like my hope is that for the majority of people, you're going to
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.620]   leave here and this week, all throughout the week, you're going to find yourself just whispering
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.620]   under your breath.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.380]   And especially when you feel stressed out or you begin to panic because you're not in
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:49.020]   control, my hope is that all throughout the week, under your breath, you're going to find
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.740]   yourself saying, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.820]   The Lord, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.820]   I shall not want."
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.700]   You're going to put it on your, your home screen.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.620]   You're going to tape it to your computer screen.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.780]   You're going to put it all over, all over the place, on your mirror, on your dashboard,
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.860]   just to remind yourself, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.220]   I shall not want."
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:13.020]   But some of you tonight just need to realize that you can't say with full integrity, "The
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.860]   Lord is my shepherd."
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.380]   You might be able to say, "The Lord is a shepherd," because you just heard a message about Jesus
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:28.260]   being shepherd, but you can't say with authenticity, "The Lord is my shepherd," because you've
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.300]   never put your trust in Jesus Christ.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.300]   You've never turned from your sin and put your trust in Jesus.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.220]   And so maybe God brought you here tonight simply so that you could hear the words of
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.780]   Isaiah 53 6.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   It says, "All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:49.300]   We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   all."
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.300]   What does that mean?
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.600]   It means that every single one of us has wandered away from God in sin.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.660]   And because of our sin, we deserve eternal separation from God.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.900]   But the good news is Jesus in John 10 11 says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.500]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:20.660]   What's interesting is Jesus, as the good shepherd, laid his life down as a lamb without blemish.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:25.580]   And he was the good shepherd by becoming the lamb that would take away the sins of the
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.580]   world.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.380]   He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and on the cross he bore all of our sins.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:36.100]   He was put in a tomb, and on the third day he walked out of it, conquering Satan's sin
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.820]   and death for all those who had put their trust in him.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.300]   If you don't know him, then my encouragement to you is to come to him in faith tonight
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.140]   and invite him into your life to be your good shepherd.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:51.500]   To know Jesus as Savior is to know him as shepherd.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   Let's pray together.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:47:09.180]   Lord Jesus, if there is anyone in the room right now who does not know you, then I pray
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.180]   that they would just sense in this moment that you are calling them by name.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.180]   John 10 says that.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.340]   "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me."
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:25.580]   I pray that right now someone would hear your voice just calling out to them to come and
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.440]   follow you.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.980]   And I pray that they would receive you as Savior and experience complete forgiveness
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.980]   of sins.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.060]   Lord Jesus, I thank you that you are in fact a good shepherd.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.300]   I pray that we, your sheep, would do business with you right now and our weeks would look
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:46.100]   different because we submit to your leadership and we rest in the fact that you are our owner.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.580]   You care about us the most.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   You're our provider and our protector and our physician.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.100]   So do a great work in our lives.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.620]   May we not just leave here unmoved or unchanged.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.940]   Speak to our hearts now.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   We love you.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.700]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
