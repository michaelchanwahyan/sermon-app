[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.320]   Love it.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.080]   We are wrapping up the series AD tonight.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.920]   Yes, tonight.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.120]   Welcome, friends in the room.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.920]   Welcome, friends downtown, friends
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.880]   in Fort Worth and Houston.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.800]   How y'all doing?
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.300]   Very good.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.240]   Love it.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.720]   The Olympics are here.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.400]   Let's go.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000]   Team USA, man.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   I think girls soccer team won tonight, too.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.080]   Who doesn't love America?
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   Is baseball an Olympic sport still?
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.360]   Man, it's like on again, off again, on again, off again.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480]   I'm going to start with a story related to baseball.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   And not related to the Olympics, but here we go.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   So a couple of years ago, I was going
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.720]   to see my nephew, who had just become old enough
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.880]   to begin playing baseball.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.340]   So he's like five or six years old.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.760]   This is his first baseball game.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.560]   I'm pumped.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.760]   First of me and my siblings' kids
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.640]   that are at age to be able to play in competitive sports.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.080]   So as a guy, you're like, yes, finally somebody is there.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.880]   We can go root them on.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.840]   This is going to be awesome.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.120]   We can live through this kid.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.760]   And so we're at--
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.440]   I go to the game.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.200]   I'm wondering, how do they throw?
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.120]   Is it underhand?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.760]   How fast do they throw the ball to a five or six-year-old?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.120]   Show up at the game.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.480]   They don't throw the ball.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.840]   They use a tee.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.040]   It's like golf, essentially.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.160]   They set it on this tee, and this baseball is set on there.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   And so these five or six-year-olds will come through,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   and they'll attempt to hit.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   So I'm waiting, see my nephew, come up to the plate.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   I'm all in.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.920]   I'm watching.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.720]   I'm rooting him on.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.000]   His name is Pierce.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   Comes up to the plate, takes his first hack,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   and it wasn't pretty.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.920]   Hits the tee, ball falls right on the ground.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.760]   It's all right, slugger.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.600]   Pick the ball back up.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.760]   Everything's going to be OK.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.000]   Coach puts the ball back on the tee, one strike.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920]   OK, I'm thinking, you got two more.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   This is going to be great.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.680]   Don't embarrass me.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.400]   That's not what I was thinking.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   But I was thinking, this is going to be awesome.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.800]   You got two strikes.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.520]   Takes his second cut, totally misses the tee and the ball
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.040]   in general.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.400]   I'm like, dude, it's 20 inches away from you.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.640]   How did you miss?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   It's all right, though.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.360]   That's only two strikes.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.320]   We got one strike left.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.520]   This is going to be great.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.960]   Rears back, takes his third cut, hits the tee,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.120]   ball goes right down, strike three.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.400]   I'm like, man, buddy, you struck out.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   It's all right.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.000]   I struck out once, too.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.400]   And I'm expecting to see him-- that's so not true.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   I'm expecting to see him, hey, you've
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.920]   got to head back to the dugout.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's OK, three strikes.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.840]   It's all right.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.040]   Maybe next time you struck out.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.280]   And all of a sudden, the coach picks up the ball
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   and he puts it back on the tee.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.160]   And I'm going, did I miscount?
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   What happened here?
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.080]   OK, watch it again.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.280]   Takes a swing, misses it again.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   Coach takes the ball, puts it back on the tee.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.080]   I'm like, that's four strikes.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.440]   What is he doing out there?
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.520]   Misses again.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's like six, seven, eight strikes.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.600]   I'm like, what type of game is this?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.280]   First off, everyone gets a trophy,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.400]   and then everybody gets a guaranteed hit.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.560]   The coach continues to put the ball on there saying,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.880]   hey, look, you have not struck out.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.200]   Everyone continues the hit.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   You have not blown it.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.360]   You have not missed your chances.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.040]   And he continues to put the ball on there
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.720]   so that he waits for each kid until they get a hit.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   Then they run to first base.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.960]   Now, the reason why I start there
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.640]   is because I think a lot of us, when it comes to God,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.580]   we feel like his perspective of us
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.840]   is not dissimilar to mine on my nephew at that point.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.920]   I'm like, hey, buddy, you only got this many chances
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.780]   and you struck out.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.720]   It's over.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.400]   That when we think of how Jesus sees us,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.480]   we're in the room tonight and we are interested in God.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   Maybe we wouldn't say we're a Christ follower.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   Maybe we're not a believer or not there yet.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.520]   You're interested.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.300]   You wanna go to heaven.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.400]   But when you look at your life,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720]   you think that you have struck out when it comes to Jesus.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.680]   When it comes to God, you've just made mistakes.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   You can look in the rear view mirror and you're like,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.060]   look, if there is a God out there,
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.800]   I'm pretty sure that when he looks down at me,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.200]   he's a little disappointed going like,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.600]   hey, take a seat on the bench.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360]   Maybe I'll let you back in, maybe not.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.880]   And the perspective that you have,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.280]   if that is your belief, is off.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.760]   And there's either something about God
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.960]   that you don't realize or you don't know him at all.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.040]   Because as we're gonna discover,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.820]   and I'm gonna attempt to convince you tonight,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.920]   and I believe that this will revolutionize your life,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.200]   that just like in that scenario where Jesus,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   or where that coach continues to put the ball on the tee
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.020]   and says, hey, you don't get just two chances, one chances.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.800]   I'm a God of unending chances.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.000]   I will continue to pursue, continue to encourage,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.240]   continue to be here to see you hit the ball off the tee.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.440]   Just like that, in the same way,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.500]   Jesus comes to all humanity and says, I will not give up.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.000]   You have not blown your chance with me.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.020]   And if you're ever gonna know me,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.660]   it's gonna come by you understanding and embracing,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.160]   that's the type of God that I am.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.640]   And so tonight, we're gonna see that
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.320]   as we wrap up the series and we continue to explore AD.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   AD is a series that's been based on encounters
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.740]   that people have with Jesus.
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.380]   Encounters with really God in the flesh.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.620]   The Bible teaches that if you ever wanna know
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.140]   what God looks like, you see that in Jesus.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.340]   Jesus is, as we've said, God in a body.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.500]   He's God on the planet with skin on.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.460]   That's who Jesus is.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.780]   So if you wanna know what does God look like,
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.400]   when God looks down at me, what type of face
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.340]   is looking at me or what type of person,
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.800]   what character is looking at me, what is God like?
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.300]   You see it in the face of Jesus.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.000]   And so tonight, we'll see it an additional time
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.700]   in the story of Jesus and maybe the most notorious person
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300]   of all the encounters that we've looked at in this series.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.140]   We're gonna be in Luke chapter 19.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.500]   Luke chapter 19, if you have a Bible,
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.340]   you can flip open there.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.740]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.360]   On that note, we have free Bibles if you're in Dallas
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.140]   in the Welcome Center for you.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.840]   If you don't have a Bible, we'd love to give that to you
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.520]   as your gift in Fort Worth.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.580]   I'm not sure where they are over there,
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.180]   but Garrett, get 'em some Bibles.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.300]   And so flip open to Luke 19.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.700]   Here's what's going on in the chat, Book of Luke.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.340]   Luke was a doctor.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.720]   Dr. Luke wrote down and recorded the gospel.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.620]   He went around interviewing all these different people.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.700]   He records one of these stories with a guy named Zacchaeus.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.940]   If you grew up like me in Sunday school,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.580]   you know that Zacchaeus was a wee little,
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.780]   a wee little man was he.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.460]   That's right, he climbed up in a--
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.740]   - [Congregation] A forest tree.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.820]   - Man, I love it.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.020]   Let's go, VBS, represent.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.860]   Let's go.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.740]   And we're gonna explore his story
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.440]   because Zacchaeus was not just a wee little cute story
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.860]   from VBS, but was one of the most notorious sinners
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.360]   and traitors in all of the Bible, if not the most.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.380]   And so we're gonna explore what that looks like
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.700]   as we see Jesus's encounter with him.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.780]   Like Luke said, next week we will kick off
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.780]   the dating series that you do not want to miss.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.980]   So Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.620]   This is towards the end of Jesus's last week,
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.580]   or right before he's about to start his last week on earth.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.180]   And he chooses to spend time,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.720]   and he interacts with this man.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.820]   So here we go, starting in verse one.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.340]   Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.140]   Now, Jericho is like Beverly Hills at this time,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.980]   like for real.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.180]   Jericho, there's writings from this time that said,
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.820]   "Look, you can wear," it's so funny,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.040]   "You can wear linens all year round.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.380]   "You can wear that," that's literally in the literature
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.540]   from a historian of this time,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.260]   where it was like Beverly Hills.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.380]   It had this really warm 70 degrees year round.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.580]   Everyone wanted to live there.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.740]   And on top of that, it's the richest city
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.140]   in the whole country.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.280]   There was lots of money coming in and out of here.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.660]   Jesus is walking through the city on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.380]   Here's what happens.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   And a man there, and a man was there by the name of Zacchaeus.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.540]   Now, Zacchaeus was a tax collector, and he was wealthy.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.980]   So the narrative just changed
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.460]   for the original audience who read this.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.660]   All of a sudden, they're told not only is his name,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.100]   there's a guy whose name's Zacchaeus,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.460]   they're told something about them
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.700]   that would have triggered all kinds
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.220]   of emotional responses in them.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.780]   He was a tax collector.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.100]   Now, we think tax collector, we think like IRS,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.940]   and they're still not like,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.780]   "Yeah, that's just what I wanna be when I grow up."
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.700]   But we don't have the perception of hatred
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.540]   that people would have had
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.780]   in the first century for tax collectors.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.900]   Tax collectors, here's what Rome did.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.140]   They'd go to a place, and they'd conquer it,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.740]   and they were ruthless.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.820]   And they basically go, "Hey,
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.800]   "we're gonna take you guys' money.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.000]   "And the way we're gonna do it is,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.260]   "whoever has the highest bid for having the position
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.500]   "of collecting money gets to be the tax collector."
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.740]   So Jews especially hated Romans,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.100]   and they hated tax collectors
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.300]   'cause they had betrayed their countrymen.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.980]   And the way that Romans got 'em to do it was they said,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.320]   "Hey, look, if you become a tax collector for us,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.160]   "you can tax as much as you want.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.600]   "You can take money from anybody
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.460]   "for any amount at any time."
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.420]   They were known of being corrupt.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.140]   They were hated by their people.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.980]   It was a job, a position in society.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.260]   It would be like being the drug cartel in Mexico
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.380]   or a mob boss in Italy.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.380]   It was a position that even by being
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.100]   in that position or profession,
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.720]   you're like, "That dude is not, he has no faith.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.560]   "He has no morals.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.260]   "He is just, he is nothing."
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.220]   And so Zacchaeus was a hated man, hated and feared
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.460]   because he'd show up on the street,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.180]   and he could take anything he wanted to from you.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.500]   And so we're introduced to who he is.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.820]   Not only that, we're told something else.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.540]   It says he was a chief tax collector.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.620]   So he's not just been in this game
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.800]   for a short amount of time.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.940]   He's been in it, he's been ruining people's lives for years
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.060]   and years, had totally abandoned any faith.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.400]   And it says this.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.200]   But he wanted to see Jesus.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.460]   But because he was short, he could not see over the crowd,
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.200]   so he ran ahead and he climbed a sycamore tree
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.420]   since Jesus was coming that way.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.580]   So Zacchaeus runs ahead.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.000]   Jesus at this point in his ministry,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.980]   like this is towards the end, he's like a rock star.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.460]   Everywhere they go, people are like,
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.020]   "Dude, that guy raised somebody from the dead.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.300]   "My cousin was dead, he's alive."
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.100]   Words getting around, Jesus, everywhere he goes,
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.940]   like, "I've seen him."
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.540]   He literally, he touched somebody's eyes
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.820]   and they could see again.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.420]   So Jesus, people are passing word.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.660]   I think the Messiah's in town.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.180]   I think the Messiah's coming through.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.860]   The Messiah's coming through Jericho.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.980]   A parade begins to form around.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.700]   Zacchaeus shows up at the parade.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.440]   He can't see Jesus because he's too small.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.220]   Now, to be called the word that is used for small
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.200]   in this time period would have been roughly around this,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.900]   it would be under five foot, essentially.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.080]   So think like he's Simone Biles height,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.920]   if you know who that is.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.960]   And if you don't, you are not an American.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.240]   And, (laughs)
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   she's a gymnast.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.280]   He's like Danny DeVito.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.360]   He's like Danny DeVito being like,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.400]   "Hey, guys, let me in here."
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.360]   So he can't see and he runs over and he's like,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.400]   "I wanna see Jesus."
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.800]   So he begins to climb up this tree
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   and he climbs in this tree, he's watching the parade,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.520]   he sees Jesus, he's walking by,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.840]   he's trying to see this man they think is the Messiah.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   All of a sudden, Jesus stops right in front of the tree.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.120]   Here's what happens.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.840]   When he reached the spot, Jesus looked up and said to him,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.880]   so he's now looking up into this tree
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.960]   and he sees a man and he says,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.820]   "Zacchaeus, come down immediately.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.840]   "I must stay at your house today."
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.680]   So he came down at once and he welcomed,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.760]   Zacchaeus comes down and he welcomes him.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.880]   Glad that you wanna stay at my house.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.520]   Nobody wants to stay at my house.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.360]   Nobody likes me.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.760]   You wanna stay, Jesus, the Messiah wants to stay at my house?
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.920]   And all the people saw this and they began to mutter
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   and he said, "He, Jesus, has gone to be the guest
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.800]   "of a sinner."
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.060]   In this society, to say, "Hey, I'm gonna come have a meal
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.800]   "or I'm gonna stay at your house."
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.420]   It's not that dissimilar to really in our own society,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.100]   but it's saying, "Hey, I wanna associate with you.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.340]   "I wanna identify with you.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.640]   "I want us to have a relationship.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.760]   "I wanna be friends with you."
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.240]   It'd be like if you go into town
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.800]   and you stay in whatever town you're from
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   or you have friends and relationships with,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   who are you gonna stay with?
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.600]   People that you identify, people who you're friends with.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.520]   And they say, "You're staying with Zacchaeus?"
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.600]   And you may be thinking like, "Man, this is why I love Jesus
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.020]   "because he's always going after the marginalized,
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.680]   "you know, the prostitutes, the beggars,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.640]   "all the people that."
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.080]   Zacchaeus is not the marginalized.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.560]   He's not a victim of the system.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.000]   He's the dude running the system.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   He's the guy who's ruined other people's lives.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.800]   He is the pimp behind the sex trafficking thing.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.080]   He's the guy that's not like, "Oh, man, I feel so."
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.760]   Zacchaeus doesn't feel bad for Zacchaeus.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.520]   Feel bad for what, man?
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.420]   All the money that I got?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.160]   The house that I got?
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.280]   You feel bad for me?
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.160]   Zacchaeus doesn't.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.060]   And the crowd, that's why they respond and say,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.440]   "What is Jesus?
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.300]   "Surely this man's not the Messiah.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.880]   "Does he know who he's associating with?"
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.460]   And Jesus goes into the home to be with this man.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.920]   It brings us to our first idea from the text
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.560]   that when it comes to God's acceptance,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.280]   there are no exceptions.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.160]   Said otherwise, there are no exceptions
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.960]   to God's acceptance.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.120]   In other words, there is no person in this room,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.580]   in history, in our world, in any time
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.920]   throughout the human race that has ever been outside
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.880]   of the boundaries of God's acceptance.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.780]   There's no person who God has looked at and he said,
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.820]   "Look, your behavior has placed you outside of the boundary
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.440]   "of someone that I would associate with,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.880]   "someone that I wanna be friends with,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.820]   "someone that I accept, someone that I love,
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.160]   "someone that I would pursue,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.780]   "someone that I will be around.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.640]   "Before you ever do anything right, Zacchaeus,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.820]   "I'm coming to your house.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.360]   "There are no boundaries on my acceptance."
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.440]   Said otherwise, there are no exceptions
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.400]   to God's acceptance.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.980]   Like this is what God is like.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.720]   When Jesus, who shows us what God is like, shows up,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.000]   he says, "I'm gonna spend time not just with the prostitute,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.540]   "with the thugs.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.620]   "With the gang leader.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.100]   "Because there's no one who's outrun my love.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.900]   "There's no one outside of the boundaries
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.020]   "of my acceptance of them.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.460]   "There are people who may not accept my acceptance
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.260]   "and have placed themselves outside of the boundaries
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.700]   "of those who I would accept, but it's not coming from God."
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.500]   I think a lot of us feel like the crowd would feel,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.540]   I mean, that's why the crowd gasps, right?
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.460]   'Cause the crowd is going like, "Dude, are you serious?
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.340]   "Do you know who this, this is a bad dude, Jesus.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.500]   "This is not a good person,
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.820]   "and you're going to spend time with him?"
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.100]   Because they think, like many of us think
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.140]   or have thought in seasons past,
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.460]   that God's opinion of us or God's love for us
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.860]   is based on what we do or based on what we have not done.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.820]   Like we feel like if God's gonna have a relationship,
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.260]   if God's gonna like us, honestly,
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.700]   one of the biggest lies that is all over our world,
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.540]   that God's opinion, God's love for us
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.220]   is based on what we do or have done.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.060]   God's love for you is not determined
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.420]   by what you've done or what you do.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.700]   He doesn't need you to get your house
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.820]   and get your life in order,
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.340]   in order for him to pursue, to approach,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.180]   for him to be a part of your life.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.500]   Said otherwise, I think a lot of us think like,
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.340]   in order for God to want to be with me,
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.340]   I've gotta like make some changes.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.500]   Like I gotta get it together.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.020]   I need to start going back to church,
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.860]   that's why I'm here tonight.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.420]   'Cause I'm like, man, if God's gonna like me,
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.380]   I'm sure I've just done too many things.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.580]   I've messed up too many times.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.020]   I've made too many mistakes.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.020]   When God looks at me, I just think he's disappointed.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.860]   And the story of Zacchaeus,
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.340]   really the message of the gospel
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.620]   is that there is no person,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.860]   there's no exception to God's acceptance.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.460]   And you don't have to get it all together
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.780]   before he will approach and wants to be a part of your life.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.940]   It's not dissimilar from this.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.180]   My community group meets,
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.340]   so I'm a part of this small group.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.860]   We meet once a week, Thursday nights.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.660]   We meet at someone's different house.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.300]   We've been in this season where we've been meeting
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.940]   at my house, me and my wife's house on Thursday nights.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.700]   So on Thursday nights, we gather at the Marvin's house,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.860]   we're getting together, it's all great.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.420]   Here's what that means for me.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.100]   And this is just gonna be a free tip
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.460]   for all the guys in the room who someday may get married.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.780]   It means that after work on Thursdays,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.620]   we have one objective in our home.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.180]   It is for me to rush home from work, come home,
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.300]   and all of a sudden, it's cleaning time.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.980]   We gotta get everything vacuumed,
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.860]   we gotta get the dog get off the couch,
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.500]   we gotta get things cleaned up, we gotta fold this,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.300]   we gotta put this stuff in this closet,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.100]   we'll deal with this later, we gotta clean things up,
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.940]   we gotta light a candle, playing some music.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.200]   Here's some cookies I baked.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.380]   We gotta get everything out, right?
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.300]   We gotta get everything in order, and I'm like, why?
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.820]   And she's like, because they're coming over.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   I'm like, they're our community.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.140]   This feels inauthentic.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.740]   We don't have cookies every night, I need you to know.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.140]   (laughing)
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.900]   Oh man, I'm gonna get in trouble for that.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.580]   And, (laughing)
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.820]   oh man, I'm so off track.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.580]   So anyways, I'm going, hey, we do not need
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.340]   to get all these things in order.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.260]   In the same way, right or wrong in that situation,
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.740]   it's not wrong to wanna get things in order
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.860]   for your community group to come over, I guess.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.220]   But, in the same way, I think for many of us,
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.680]   as it relates to God, that's how we think about him.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.020]   Like, hey, I think God is here,
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.940]   I need to make sure I'm in church,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.060]   and I haven't looked at porn in two weeks,
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.580]   and hey, I'm getting out of this relationship,
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.860]   and God, I'm trying to tithe a little bit more,
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.700]   and I'm trying to do this better,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.740]   and we try to hold everything,
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.580]   we try to make ourselves look presentable,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.060]   as though that is going to be the thing
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.260]   that allows God to be welcomed in our home,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.180]   or will make God want to be a part of our life.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.980]   And it's just ridiculous.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.780]   And so many of us have bought into that idea,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.140]   where you're sitting in the room,
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.460]   and if that's a part of your story,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.900]   if you're going, does God, when he looks at me,
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.140]   is his opinion of me, one of like,
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.900]   man, I would not wanna be a part of your life.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.860]   The story of Zacchaeus is for you.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.220]   Because the story of someone who did way worse things
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.940]   than I promise you you will ever do,
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.940]   he financed the murder of his family.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.620]   He financed the murder of Jewish people around him.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.260]   That's what tax collectors did.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.300]   We're gonna pay for the Romans,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.400]   who are the guys killing us all around here.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.980]   We're gonna pay for them.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.620]   And even that person, Jesus says,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.420]   no person is beyond my acceptance.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.320]   The other group in the room that's fallen for a lie,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.160]   that God's opinion of them is related to the behavior,
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.700]   is those who think, man, God does love me,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.940]   'cause I'm a good person.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.180]   Like, you know, I followed the DARE program
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.420]   when I was growing up, and I saved myself for marriage,
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.100]   and I pay my taxes on time, and I try to be nice,
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.780]   and I'm a good person, and I read my Bible,
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.740]   and I'm not like those crazy people who smoke that,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.380]   and do that, and drink that.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.780]   I'm one of those good people.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.460]   And so God probably is a little bit more pleased with me.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.140]   God is pleased.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.540]   And both of those, whether you think God can't love you,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.340]   or God does love you, because of your behavior,
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.660]   you're thinking like the crowd,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.260]   you're not thinking like Jesus,
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.700]   and you're not thinking in line
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.480]   with how God sees humanity.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   That there is no exceptions to those that God will accept.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.220]   Your performance does not determine his love.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.880]   God's love for you is not determined
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.700]   on what you've done or what you do.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.320]   I mean, even, and this, we'll move on.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.760]   Even the fact, I mean, think about this,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.960]   and I know this is so common, so I'm hitting this hard,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.540]   'cause I believe that, like, as much as we're like,
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.380]   yeah, it's not, there's part of us that still believes that.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.940]   Even think about the idea of, like, if it was based
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.320]   on your behavior, God doesn't see humanity
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.400]   like we see humanity.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.060]   Like, you're like, yeah, Thursday and Friday,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:50.960]   it's been a great week.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.660]   I think God's probably like, hey, that a boy.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.820]   Champ, go get him.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.060]   That that's how God's looking down, and it's like,
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.380]   hey, it's been a great week, and I just feel close to God.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.300]   God doesn't see Thursday.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.860]   He sees six years from now all the things
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.180]   that you're gonna do between now and then,
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.620]   for all eternity.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.200]   And he sees everything in your past,
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.860]   and everything you're gonna do next week,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.780]   things you haven't even thought about,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.660]   people you haven't even met yet,
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.700]   and the ways that you've treated them.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.980]   And despite knowing all of that, he says,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.180]   I'm gonna die on a cross for you.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.700]   That's how much I love you.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.460]   That's how much my love for you is not determined
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.460]   by what you've done or by what you do.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.740]   I sit outside of time.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.140]   I see all of it.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.640]   Don't buy the lie that your behavior puts you
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.420]   outside of the boundaries of my acceptance.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.980]   You may put yourself outside if you do not accept
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.480]   the free gift that I offer.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.580]   But I'm not the one placing you outside of there.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.960]   And Zacchaeus' message is a testimony.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.620]   There's no exceptions to God acceptance.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.860]   It also tells us something else.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Here's what happens.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.420]   They go in and they have this meal.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.020]   He's sitting down with Jesus.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.340]   Well, did it last four hours?
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.740]   Did it last an hour?
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.980]   Did it last a night?
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.500]   He said, I'm gonna stay with you.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.700]   Maybe it took all night.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.760]   But Jesus and Zacchaeus have this meal,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.340]   and at some point, everything changes.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.820]   In other words, at some time between verse seven
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.780]   and verse eight, which we're about to look at,
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.340]   everything changes.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.380]   Zacchaeus changes.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.220]   Here's what happens.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.580]   He sits down at this meal, and all of a sudden,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.140]   at some point in the meal, maybe he goes through the steps
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.180]   that happen when you become a Christian.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.800]   There's conviction and then a conversion.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.140]   And it leads to this repentance.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.980]   And here's what he says.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.940]   And the meal stands up.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.300]   Maybe he takes his glass, ding, ding.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   And he says this, Lord,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.260]   here now I give half of my possessions to the poor.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.460]   If I've cheated anybody out of anything,
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.220]   I will pay it back four times the amount.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.780]   At some point between verse seven and verse eight,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.460]   he goes and he has this meal, and everything changes.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.520]   That Zacchaeus bumps into Jesus,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.100]   and everything begins to change.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.980]   And how powerful is this testimony?
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.300]   I mean, how powerful, this that takes place,
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.820]   how crazy is this gonna be for everyone inside of the town
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.260]   as they begin to bump up into Zacchaeus,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.140]   who has now met Jesus, his life has been turned around.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.900]   He says, this is Bill Gates saying,
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.780]   I'm gonna sell half of everything that I own,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.580]   and I'm giving it to the poor.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.740]   And anybody, this is the cartel leader,
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.620]   and anybody that I've wronged,
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.460]   I'm not just gonna make up for it by saying,
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.220]   hey, look, I stole this from you,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.600]   I'm gonna give it back to you,
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.260]   I'm gonna give four times the amount of what I've stolen.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.620]   You ever had something stolen from you?
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   Like if your car, like my car's been broken into,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.700]   and they steal your radio.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.300]   This would be like somebody showing up six months later
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.700]   on your front porch going, hey, I met Jesus,
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.100]   and I brought your radio back, and four other radios.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.300]   That's what Zacchaeus just did.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.100]   He says, look, anybody that I've defrauded,
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.700]   whatever I've done, I mean, think about it.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.340]   How powerful is that?
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.060]   Hey, honey, Zacchaeus is at the door.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.660]   Act like we're not home.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.460]   I think he knows we're home.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.940]   Yes, open the door, Zacchaeus is there.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.320]   Look, I've stolen from you, I have a tax refund for you.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.460]   The amount that I took, and four times that amount,
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.580]   I met Jesus, my life has changed.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.700]   I gave half of everything that I owned to the poor.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.180]   I mean, how crazy and amazing is that story?
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.500]   How powerful is that to showcase
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.160]   that Jesus can change anybody?
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.100]   Which brings us to our second idea from the text.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.100]   There is no mess that he cannot use to be a ministry.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.160]   There's no part of your life, no mess in your life.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.180]   By mess, I mean mistakes, ways that you have just said,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.700]   man, I look around, and everywhere that I look,
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.540]   I've blown it.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.260]   There's no part of your story in your past,
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.140]   no addiction, no abortion, no anything,
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.020]   no relationship, no sexual promiscuity,
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.620]   where you're just like, man, I had one partner
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.460]   after the next.
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.540]   There's no part of your story that God cannot say,
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.220]   I'm gonna take that mess, and I am going to make
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.740]   a ministry out of it.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.260]   I'm going to use it to be a part of ministering
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.820]   to the world around you.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.120]   And Zacchaeus, who, if there was any person
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.640]   who had made a mess in his life,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.940]   who had made mistake after mistake,
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.620]   who had run from God, all of a sudden encounters Jesus,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.100]   and everything changes, and his mess becomes his ministry.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.620]   I met Jesus.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.940]   I'm giving this away to the poor.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.780]   Even the fact that how much he gives back,
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.420]   how much he restores, is four times the amount
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.900]   of what was legally required.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.380]   Like, he goes way above and beyond.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.300]   He radically encountered Jesus, and he radically changed.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.140]   Here's what I mean.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.860]   The law said, if you steal, you give exactly back,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.460]   like, if you steal 100 bucks, you give $100 back,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.100]   and 1/5 of what you stole.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.380]   So if you steal $100, you give back 100, plus $20.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.380]   Zacchaeus says, I'm giving back $500.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.780]   I'm going way above the law.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.740]   This isn't about law, this is about love.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.660]   I've met a person who changed me.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.940]   He changed me from a greedy person to a generous person,
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.140]   and everything changed.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.220]   There's no part of your story
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.660]   that if you and I will allow God to step in,
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.820]   he will not use and change to be a ministry for him.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.460]   I mean, honestly, this is how he works all the time.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.940]   So many of the ministries at Watermark
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.980]   are people who blew it,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.900]   or people who were sinned against,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.560]   and all kinds of pain was a part of their life,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.460]   and in the midst of that, they turned to God,
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.900]   and they said, God, this is where I'm a broken person,
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.140]   but I trust in you.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.260]   You're the God who comes into broken people's lives,
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.860]   and you change them, you take a mess,
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.020]   and you make it a ministry.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.700]   I mean, MEND.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.140]   MEND is a ministry for men
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.880]   who've been experienced sexual abuse.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.220]   They've come in, and they just said, look, God,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.060]   this is all the brokenness here, will you use it?
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.220]   And a guy who had experienced sexual abuse
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.160]   started that ministry.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.420]   Someone Cares was started by a girl who said,
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.740]   hey, I had an abortion, it was part of my past.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.320]   I want you to take God, if you will, my mess,
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.480]   and will you turn it and use it for ministry?
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.040]   All over the place, region, region.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.120]   The people who run region were suicidal,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.200]   alcoholics, had a shotgun in my mouth.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.980]   I met Jesus, and everything changed.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.320]   Every single direction you look,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.160]   all over this place, there's stories
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   of people who said, God, I'm bringing you my mess,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.640]   and you're the God who takes messes,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.820]   and you make it a ministry.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.120]   Will you do that here?
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.080]   And whatever your story is,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.640]   that's exactly what he wants to do with you.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.360]   Whatever that part of you that you're like,
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.780]   man, I just can't, I've never told anybody this.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.520]   Whatever that part of you that you're like, I hate.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.460]   I don't know if it's like this thing,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.580]   that it's alcoholism, maybe it's cutting,
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.780]   maybe it's an eating disorder,
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.560]   maybe it's same-sex attraction, whatever it is,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.880]   there's no part of your past that God can't take
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.540]   and make a platform for his power.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.200]   If we just surrender and hand it over to him,
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.840]   and just like in Zacchaeus' case,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.580]   he takes messes and makes a ministry out of it.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:07.240]   Personally, I've experienced firsthand
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.880]   the pain of outside circumstances,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.400]   which maybe that's part of your story in the room.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.940]   You're like, I was, maybe you experienced sexual abuse,
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.760]   or maybe you experienced divorce of a parent,
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.900]   and maybe you experienced just something in a job
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.160]   where you were robbed by somebody around you.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   In my own story, personally, I felt the pains
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.920]   and feel the scars of having a father that wasn't around.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.840]   And you know what's weird?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.600]   It's like that over and over again,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.320]   God uses me to have a voice or a microphone
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.400]   into the lives of people who, just like me,
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.560]   did not have a father around.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.120]   That he takes this father wound
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.360]   and through the body of Christ, works in it, heals in it,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.880]   and brings about an opportunity to just say,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   hey, this is what I'm walking through.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.600]   'Cause honestly, all over the room, I mean, 50%,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.880]   we are the fatherless generation.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.160]   And in my story, that's what he's done.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.240]   He's used that.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.400]   There's girls on our staff,
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.680]   one of the best ministers of the gospel I know,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.400]   abortion was part of her story.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.120]   She didn't hide it, she didn't hold it back.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.240]   She brought it to the Lord, and everything changed.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   She ministers to women week in and week out
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.160]   who have that a part of their story.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.460]   And you may be in the room thinking,
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.520]   man, well, I did not have a rebellious stage in life.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.720]   I mean, what is my ministry?
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.200]   What is my testimony that I can just say,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.880]   hey, this is how God worked?
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.900]   That is the best testimony in the room.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.740]   Like that is, if you're the person who says,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.240]   hey, I was raised in church,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.480]   I never really had that season
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.600]   where I ran away from Christ,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.120]   like God in his grace protected me.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.840]   That is the testimony that all across this country,
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.160]   really our world, people are praying that people would have.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.200]   If that's your story, you have nothing to be ashamed of,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.320]   you have everything to be proud of
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.680]   because God, he didn't need to show you how bitter sin was
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.200]   for you to know how sweet it is to know Jesus.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.920]   You just believed it and you trusted
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.360]   and experienced the sweetness of God.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.540]   I pray that my son has that testimony.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.360]   Everyone on our staff prays that their children
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.200]   would have that.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.540]   Every person in the world's like,
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.080]   they're like, man, I wish that I had a crazy testimony
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.480]   that was like strippers and drugs and sex and rock and roll.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.400]   But if my children, I definitely don't.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.640]   And the person that I marry,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.440]   I'd like them to be a little more straight laced too.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   And so everyone, nobody's like, oh, that's a,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.000]   if that's your story, you have an amazing testimony,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.600]   the best testimony of God's grace.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.800]   And that's your opportunity to use that microphone
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.880]   and say, man, God protected me.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.460]   I've walked with him.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.060]   I've seen and tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   I don't need to eat vomit or dog poop to know it's not good.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.040]   I believe that it wasn't good
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.240]   when everybody else was eating the,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.040]   what a weird illustration, dog poop.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.560]   And that is your ministry.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.120]   And Zacchaeus ate the dog poop.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.840]   That's not true at all.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.280]   But whatever your story is in this room and in Fort Worth
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.720]   and in Houston and downtown, God wants to take it
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.760]   and use it to minister all the parts,
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.840]   all the dark parts, all the light parts,
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.800]   to minister for him.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.840]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.080]   And here's Jesus' response as we close up.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.600]   And Jesus said to him,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.760]   all right, Zacchaeus, we're gonna wait a few weeks
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.160]   and see if this really sticks,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.800]   'cause I'm not really sure that this is a genuine conversion
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.640]   Senator always said.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.560]   Here's what he says.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   Today, salvation has come to this house
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.880]   because this man too is a son of Abraham.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.080]   In other words, this man too
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.840]   is a child of God's covenant family.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.480]   This man too is a child of God, you could say.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.560]   For the son of man,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.200]   which is Jesus' favorite title for himself,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.760]   came to seek and to save the lost.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.400]   That in response to Zac, Jesus says salvation has come,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.960]   personifies salvation.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.320]   And it's like it showed up at this house
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.480]   and he's a child of Abraham.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.600]   But it didn't come through him trying harder.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.880]   It came through him encountering a person.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.640]   Like the third idea from this text,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.520]   if you take notes, you run it on third point here,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.080]   is that we don't need a second chance.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.340]   We need a savior.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.860]   The message to all humanity,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.640]   the message that Zacchaeus responded to
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.800]   and everything changed was not,
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.480]   hey, if you try a little harder, Zacchaeus,
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.400]   here's a new law, here's a new principle,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.120]   here's a new thing to adopt, then God will accept you.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.200]   He didn't need a second chance or a third chance.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.120]   He needed a savior.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.920]   And when he encountered that savior, which was a person,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.800]   everything changed.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.880]   Another way of saying this is Jesus personifies,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   man, I love this.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.680]   He says salvation came to this house.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.840]   Wait a second, Jesus, you came to the house.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.660]   Salvation came to the house.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.800]   Salvation has a name, Jesus.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.880]   In other words, salvation does not come through a process.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.160]   And listen to me very closely
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.520]   because a lot of you in the room
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.840]   were raised in denominations or church beliefs
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.280]   or maybe religious expressions
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.240]   where you were not taught this.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.800]   You were taught that salvation comes through a process,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.640]   that it comes through keeping some sacraments
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.400]   or doing this prayer a certain amount of times
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.000]   or doing a certain amount of actions that God will love you
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.640]   if you do over 50%.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.680]   The Bible teaches salvation does not come through a process.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.560]   It comes through a person.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   That person has a name, Jesus.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.440]   And if you're ever gonna encounter the living God,
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.040]   if you're ever going to spend,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.520]   if you're ever gonna spend eternity with God,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.880]   it will not happen through you adopting a process,
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.920]   through you keeping a certain number of sacraments,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.720]   through you doing a certain number of good deeds.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.840]   It will happen the day that you encounter a person
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   named Jesus, a Savior,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.360]   who didn't come to give a second chance
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.320]   so that you could try harder.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.880]   He came to save you and to save me.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.680]   And just like Zacchaeus, who was undeserving,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.920]   who was broken,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.280]   who was anyone that did not deserve God's love,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.300]   it would be him.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.960]   Jesus shows up
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.680]   and he says, "I'm coming to your house.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.240]   "I'm coming to change you."
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.920]   If you ever have a relationship with God,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.680]   it will happen in encountering the God
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.000]   who has come to you in the form of Jesus,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.200]   not going through a process, but meeting a person,
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.800]   encountering a person.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.760]   If you wanna have the righteousness that God requires,
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.840]   in other words, the Bible teaches that,
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.360]   and really all religions teach,
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   in order to have a relationship with God,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.000]   you gotta have righteousness.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.640]   What makes Christianity different
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.100]   from every other religion is they all teach
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.680]   what other religions teach.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.240]   Righteousness is something that we pile on
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.160]   and we bring to God.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   And God, I'm gonna do this,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.840]   I'm gonna do a little bit more of this,
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.660]   and I'm gonna do a little,
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.640]   and here I'm bringing you my righteousness.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.180]   Christianity teaches righteousness
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.000]   is something God brings to you,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.460]   that God brings to Christians,
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.720]   that it's not something you earn,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.540]   it is something that a person named Jesus
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.080]   shows up and delivers.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.400]   Salvation is not in a process,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.520]   but it's found in a person,
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.740]   and in encountering that person, everything changes.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.980]   That's when change begins to happen.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.820]   Just like in,
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.520]   when I got married,
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.780]   all of a sudden, I like encountered this person
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.420]   and everything began to change.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   Like I was 25, I got married,
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.180]   her name was Callie, still is,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.560]   and it hadn't changed.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.500]   And all of a sudden, like we got married
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.740]   and everything changed.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.060]   We went from like, oh, I'm living in this,
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.880]   you know, kind of corner of this house
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.060]   with like eight other guys,
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   to oh, no, we have to have our own place.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.140]   And all of a sudden, not only where I live changed,
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.420]   but like the things inside of my home,
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.860]   we got these things called decorations.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.620]   And then we got things like called like a candle,
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.020]   like what's a candle, you light it.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.720]   And then everything that we,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.460]   the way that I ate changed.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.300]   The way that it's like,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.360]   hey, you can't eat that every night.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.140]   The way that the TV shows that we watched,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.660]   it was like, we're not watching ESPN at all.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.060]   Things around us, and the futon is not coming in our home.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.860]   All these different things on like how I slept,
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.380]   where I lived, everything began to change
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.920]   because I encountered a person.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.740]   And in the same way, that's what Christianity is.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.800]   It's not a principle.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.680]   It's not you encountering a new law.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.260]   It's encountering a person named Jesus.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.140]   And the day you encounter him,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.340]   the day you begin to walk with him
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.180]   is the day that everything changes.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.460]   For some of us in the room,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.540]   and I'll close here and give kind of application,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.980]   and we'll close with a story.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.340]   I think some of you here tonight is your night,
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.460]   and you need to accept the acceptance
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.720]   that God is offering to you.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.260]   Like some of you in the room, just like Zacchaeus,
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.420]   you think that if God's looking down at you,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.740]   either he's pleased with you, like, hey, God does love me
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.540]   'cause I've been a pretty good person,
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.620]   and I'm trying to do good,
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.980]   and I'm trying to keep things together.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   And the message for you tonight is your night
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.640]   to accept that you are not a good person.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.100]   The Bible doesn't even teach that good people go to heaven
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.620]   and bad people go to hell.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.780]   It teaches forgiven people go to heaven.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.920]   And the only way to get forgiven
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.220]   is by putting your faith in Jesus,
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.140]   trusting that Jesus on the cross paid for your sin.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:18.220]   And he offers a free gift to anyone who will accept it.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.980]   That, hey, I will cover, I've covered your sin.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.260]   The check cleared, I rose from the dead,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.940]   showing the payment was more than enough.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.820]   And anyone who will just accept that message
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.980]   will have eternal life.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.620]   And the message for you tonight is will you accept it?
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.740]   That is the question that remains for all mankind,
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.060]   is not has God and would God accept them?
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.120]   It is he already has,
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.100]   but have they accepted his free gift on the cross,
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.660]   dying in their place?
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.040]   And tonight is your night.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.500]   Regardless of where you're sitting,
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.420]   regardless of where you are, if you're listening online,
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.380]   if you're listening in Houston, tonight is your night
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.540]   where you don't have to wonder anymore
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.620]   how God feels about you.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.660]   You don't have to wonder anymore
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.020]   where you're gonna spend eternity with.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.980]   You don't have to wonder anymore
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.320]   if you die on your way home tonight,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.720]   which God forbid happen.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.240]   But you can have peace, rest,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.720]   in the fact that Jesus on the cross paid for it.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.920]   If you'll just accept it, what does that look like?
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.900]   It means trusting that Jesus paid for your sin.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.580]   That when it comes to everything that you've ever done,
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.760]   God, you paid for it.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.080]   You did away with it.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.920]   You paid for it.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.740]   I didn't deserve it.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.160]   I'm not deserving.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.280]   But I need a savior because I'm a sinner.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.720]   And in light of that, despite everything that I've done,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.360]   you loved me enough to pay for it.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.600]   And tonight, if in a moment of faith,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.980]   if you say, I believe that, not just say the words,
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.440]   but you believe it in your heart, everything will change.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.920]   Your eternity will change.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.420]   Your life like Zacchaeus will begin to change.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:49.440]   Many of us in the room have experienced it firsthand.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.980]   And it all begins in that moment of accepting the God
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.080]   who's already accepted you,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.780]   who's already reaching out to you.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.960]   A lot of times people will pray a prayer in their seat,
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.840]   wherever you are.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.320]   It's not a prayer that saves you.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.740]   It is believing and trusting your savior that saves you.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.320]   And if you're in the room tonight, tonight is your night.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.760]   And we wanna talk to you afterwards,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.600]   if we can lead you through what that looks like.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.640]   Do not leave this room.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.400]   There's no decision that will matter more
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.300]   for all of eternity than that one.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.960]   And for those of us in the room who have accepted it,
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.040]   we have this amazing opportunity and responsibility
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.260]   to now go extend it,
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.640]   to extend it to a world that's full of Zacchaeuses
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.120]   like you and I, who never deserved it,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.240]   who don't still deserve it.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.880]   And yet God, despite all of that,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.040]   is the God who says, "I'm gonna put the ball back on the tee
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.140]   "out of my love for you,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.040]   "despite everything you've done or do."
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.480]   That's the God who is there.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   And that's why we take, that's why we do ministry.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.700]   That's why we do everything that we do.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.320]   It's why we're downtown right now.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.840]   We're trying to reach the city of Dallas,
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.960]   reach the city of Houston,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.200]   reach a world who is bought into this lie
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.720]   that I'm convinced is the best lie
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.080]   that Satan's ever told.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.320]   That if you're a good person,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.120]   then God's gonna like you more than if you're a bad person.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.580]   And so just be a good person.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.760]   And it's a lie.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.920]   It's a lie, and to use extreme language, from hell.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.600]   And anyone who buys into it
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.920]   will not spend eternity with their Savior.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.760]   And we have a responsibility and opportunity now
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.920]   to go extend this amazing free gift,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.680]   this message that God has accepted
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.940]   all those who will accept his free gift.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.640]   I'll close here because I think for many of us
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.560]   in the room, we have, and what Jesus says to Zacchaeus
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.460]   is that you're a child of God.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.400]   And yet all throughout the portraits
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.920]   that we've looked at the past few weeks,
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.280]   when it comes to the story of Zacchaeus,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.640]   when it comes to the story of really Jesus
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.780]   and the narrative we see inside of the Bible,
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.960]   I think there's a lot of us that struggle to believe
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.800]   that God could be as good as he is.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.160]   That he looks at me and he sees me like a child,
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.680]   that God really does look at you right now
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.400]   and look at you just like a child, like his child.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.080]   And all the emotions and all the care
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.520]   and all the ways that that plays itself out on earth
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.280]   only to a times 10 degree
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.740]   is the way that God feels about you and me.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.760]   Like here's one example.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.720]   This past week, my son, who's eight months old,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.680]   his name's Crew, he started crawling.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   He's crawling around the house.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.040]   It's awesome because it's a race to see
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.920]   versus all your other kids or all your friends
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.240]   who have kids the same age who crawls first.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.440]   And so we're winning and that's not true.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.500]   He's crawling around the house.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.760]   He's beginning to do this next phase where he stands up
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.520]   and he picks up, he'll pull up.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.360]   It's awesome.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.880]   And he'll begin to like try to move
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.560]   and he'll take a step and he'll take a step.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.400]   And all of a sudden he'll like hands off
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.920]   and he'll take one step and it's like,
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.520]   oh my gosh, look at him, he's walking.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.480]   And we're of course like first time parents, we're freaked.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.520]   Are you getting this on camera?
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.800]   Is this on camera right now?
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.640]   Are you serious?
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.480]   It's not working, pull it up.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.880]   Oh, he fell, oh my gosh.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.040]   So we're trying to document all this.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.640]   It's amazing, we're going crazy.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.320]   Like our son, he's taking a step.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   And then all of a sudden like he'll fall.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.640]   Like it happens over and over and it's like he's fall.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.240]   And you know how to don't go, I'm not like,
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.520]   oh man, I can't, unbelievable, man.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.960]   This is, delete the video, this is ridiculous.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.400]   Are you serious?
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.720]   It's not that hard, buddy.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.000]   Look at me, I've been doing it for years.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.640]   No, it's not what you do.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.560]   You go, hey, it's okay, it's okay.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.200]   Here we go, are we gonna try again?
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.600]   And he takes a step and you're like,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.480]   that's my boy, he just took a step, this is unbelievable.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.280]   When he does like nothing, when he falls on the ground,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.480]   you're like, it was a leaning step, this is amazing.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.680]   The portrait that the Bible tells us about Jesus,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.480]   the portrait the Bible gives us about God
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   is that God is not a father who goes,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.120]   unbelievable, really, you fell again?
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.040]   You tripped and fell?
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   Oh my gosh, it's not that hard.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.680]   Look at me, I'm amazing, I'm perfect Jesus.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.000]   You can't do this.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.480]   But he looks down at his children
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.880]   and in the same way that a father just goes crazy,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.480]   like I don't want you to fall,
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.360]   I don't want you to get hurt, my son, me,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.440]   I don't want him to fall and hit his head.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.880]   I don't want him to get hurt, all those things.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.740]   But at the same time, my love for him
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.600]   doesn't go up and down.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.920]   When he does, I rush and I pick him up
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.480]   and I celebrate like crazy.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.840]   He took steps, he's walking.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.600]   He took a step and Jesus, God in a bod,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.920]   God himself, when he looks down at you and me
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.480]   at the same way that he doesn't rejoice when you stumble,
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.040]   he doesn't get caught up there and he celebrates
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.840]   when his children are taking steps and walking with him.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.520]   Some of you in the room, you need to know that
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.640]   because you're so caught up and you may think like,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.960]   Zacchaeus thought individually that,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.360]   God, I'm just such a failure.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.920]   I'm so, I fall all the time, God.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.280]   Could you really love me?
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.480]   And he looks at you like a father with their child.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.240]   That's the picture we're given.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.720]   In fact, at one point, Jesus even says,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.420]   hey, God's relationship is like a father with a child,
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:07.040]   even though you guys are evil fathers, is what he says.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   He says, God, who is a perfect loving father,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.800]   is like that with his children and he looks at you
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.360]   and he celebrates when you take those steps,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.400]   he celebrates when you move in his direction
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.800]   and he goes, that's my girl.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.520]   That's my girl who's walking with me.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.880]   That's my girl who's dating the way that I want her to.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.320]   Man, she fell down today, but she's gonna get back up.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.720]   We're gonna pick her back up.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.640]   That's my boy.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.320]   And he looks at you with eyes of a loving father
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.640]   and the same hands that reached out to Zacchaeus
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.840]   and changed his life,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.600]   the same heart that desires to seek out
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.800]   those who are far from God is the same heart
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.480]   that is crazy about you
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.040]   and wants you to know him if you don't
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.720]   and wants you to know how much he loves you if you do
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.080]   and really regardless
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.800]   and wants you to know how much he celebrates when you walk,
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.100]   when you just take a step.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.860]   I'm gonna pray that that would mark our lives.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.540]   The perspective that Jesus gives us
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.100]   all throughout this series,
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.700]   that we would encounter Jesus
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.620]   because everything changes then
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.340]   for Zacchaeus, for me, and for you.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.180]   Let me pray.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:29.780]   God, I can't even get my mind around the idea
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.900]   that you love us like a father with their child.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.540]   That you love us enough not just in the ways
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   that you don't just love us because we behave, Father.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.180]   You love us despite knowing every way that we haven't,
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.500]   every way that we don't,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.020]   so much that you'll say, "I'll die in their place."
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.940]   I'm crazy about 'em.
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.660]   And I know in this room, there are men and women
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.540]   who don't know and don't believe that.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.380]   And so, Lord, would you do what only you can do,
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.900]   which is would you grab their heart?
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.300]   Would you win in their heart?
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.060]   Would you win in their heart?
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:10.540]   For those who don't believe that they need a Savior,
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.220]   don't believe that they're as messed up as Zacchaeus,
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.060]   would you win in their heart, Father?
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.660]   For those who right now see themselves as that Zacchaeus
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.420]   and they're going, "God, could you love me?"
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.540]   And I know they're gonna come up after this message
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.660]   and they're still buying into that lie
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.940]   that God's love for them is based on what they do
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.260]   or what they haven't done.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.460]   Would you pierce through with the truth, Father,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.100]   of who you are, of your love for us?
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.660]   And would you win tonight?
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.460]   Would you win more of our hearts,
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.300]   win more of those souls that are in this room?
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.580]   Father, we love you, we thank you for Jesus,
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.340]   our ultimate victory, amen.
