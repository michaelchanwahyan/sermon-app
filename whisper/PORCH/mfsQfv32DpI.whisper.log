[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.960]   - All right, what's up everybody in the room?
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   Everybody tuning in, I want to welcome
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.520]   PortsLive locations, Ports Indy,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.220]   Ports Greater Lafayette, Des Moines,
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.840]   Cincy, Midland, wherever you're tuning in from,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.940]   and of course Dallas, Texas,
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.680]   the home of the Dallas Mavericks,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   about to launch the greatest comeback in NBA history.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.920]   Happening man, Luka's going off 42,
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   you'll see it after tonight.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.720]   Okay, hey, we're continuing the series,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   Point of View, if you were just joining us,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.800]   we are in a series where we are looking
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.620]   at the point of view of people who interacted
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.080]   with the son of God when he was on the planet,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.240]   and tonight we're going to continue,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.560]   and let me ask a question to set up
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.680]   where we're going to be going tonight.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.040]   What is the best movie soundtrack of all time?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.920]   (audience shouting)
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.720]   Parent, parent, parent trap?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.960]   It is definitely not the parent trap, that is for sure.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.380]   Tarzan, what else?
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540]   (audience shouting)
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.980]   What?
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.300]   La La Land?
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.260]   All right, Lion King,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.600]   I don't know which one it is for you.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300]   It is definitely not the parent trap though,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.660]   I'm going to reiterate that.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.820]   I think arguably, at least in the top five,
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.460]   you've got to put Lion King in there,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.660]   probably Tarzan, maybe you overwound it.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.620]   My kids recently, I've got a six year old,
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.040]   about to be a four year old, and a four month old,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.820]   and with our older two, of course,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.460]   Disney is just, you just live and breathe it.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.420]   And so we go back and we watch the Disney movies
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.620]   that I grew up on as a kid,
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.740]   and one of those being Lion King,
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.980]   and recently we watched Lion King,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.940]   and I don't remember, I don't know if you've seen it,
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   or remember the plot, I'm about to spoil it,
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.540]   but you're 25 years late, so I don't care.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.660]   Anyways, in the plot, you know, Simba,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.960]   he's born, he's got Mufasa,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   and eventually that evil Uncle Scar sets this thing up,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.320]   Simba ends up being a part of seeing his dad die,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.920]   and he runs off to live with Timon and Pumbaa,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.720]   and eat bugs, eventually the monkey shows up,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.400]   and he sees his dad in the sky,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.620]   and he goes back, defeats Scar, wins the setup.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.060]   Now my kids are seeing this,
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.680]   and recently watched it for the first time,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.320]   and of course, they're going to latch onto the music,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   and so whenever we drive around,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.800]   they want to listen to Disney soundtracks of music,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.280]   so it's Tarzan, Lion King,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.680]   and recently they were singing,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   and they had just watched the movie,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520]   and they were singing in the car this past Wednesday,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.000]   we're just jamming out, and they're singing,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.880]   I Just Can't Wait to be King, as you do,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.960]   and eventually my six year old,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.000]   and my four year old are sitting there,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.360]   and we're singing it and driving in the car,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.640]   and my six year old goes,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   wait, why does he want to be king when he's younger,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.320]   but when he gets older, he doesn't want to be king anymore?
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.780]   And we just entered into this serious conversation,
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.160]   and before I get to answer it,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   my four year old, and she's three months to be four,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.960]   and she is at that stage where she can't pronounce her R's,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.680]   and yet she thinks she knows everything in the world,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.520]   so she's like to her brother, Crew,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.400]   Crew, Crew, he doesn't want to be king,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000]   'cause he wants to be with Timon and Pumbaa,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.680]   and it's like, no, that's not it,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.640]   yeah, he wants to be with Timon and Pumbaa eating the bugs,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.720]   and it's like, no, that's not why he doesn't want to be king,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.220]   and I'm trying to figure out how to articulate
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.800]   that Simba carries this shame
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.560]   that he blames himself for for his dad,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.720]   and that leads him to run away
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.600]   and try to run from his problems,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.560]   and we're in this conversation,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.760]   and what's ironic or interesting about it
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.120]   is in so many ways,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.800]   that encounter with someone experiencing shame,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   regret, remorse, blame,
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.400]   and it leading to them running
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.260]   or seeking to escape from the problems in their past
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.560]   or the problems that they have is,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.500]   it's a common human experience.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.720]   In other words, this is a lesson they're learning
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.580]   at six and four, but they're gonna be exposed
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.280]   to people that do this for the rest of their life
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.620]   that may even be something they do in their life,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.540]   and what does that have to do
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.180]   with what we're gonna talk about tonight?
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.880]   We're gonna look at a story
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.240]   that involves someone who is covered in shame
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.480]   and see how Jesus deals with it,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.920]   brings healing to it,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.720]   and my hope, 'cause I think about that story,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   and candidly, I think inside of this room,
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.520]   that some of you guys, you carry shame and regret
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   and remorse over things
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.340]   that you've been carrying for decades,
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.800]   and as I was preparing this message
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.640]   and just thinking through the text
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   that we're gonna look at,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.440]   my hope and prayer is that some of us would leave
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.360]   and just the weight of shame
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.600]   that we're carrying would be lifted.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.240]   Maybe it's shame from not even something you chose to do
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.180]   was done to you, a form of abuse.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.340]   Maybe it's shame in your relationship with God,
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.440]   and if you were honest, you feel like every time
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.840]   you go to pray, you're just flooded
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.960]   with all of the different sin in your past
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.720]   or maybe your present.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.440]   Maybe it's shame from an eating disorder
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.200]   that no one knows,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.840]   and everything looks normal on the outside,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.400]   but you know, and when you're all alone
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.880]   and you're staring at the ceiling,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.380]   it just, it haunts you.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.800]   Maybe it's a decision in your past
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.840]   from some sexual experience
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.240]   that you never thought that would be a part of your story,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.720]   but it is, and it is something you carry with you every day,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.040]   and what you're gonna discover and I'm gonna discover
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.300]   is that Jesus wants to meet us in that
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.840]   and help us experience freedom from that,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.360]   and so we're gonna look briefly at a story
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.160]   in John chapter 21, and it involves Jesus being seen
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.280]   through the point of view of the most famous
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.560]   of all the disciples, Peter,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.960]   and it's in a moment where Peter is carrying tremendous shame
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   from arguably the worst failure in the New Testament,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.320]   where he had abandoned and denied this guy
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.680]   that he'd followed for years and that he promised
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.200]   that he would never abandon.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.880]   He would go to his death for, go to prison for,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.200]   and yet he didn't, and he's now carrying this shame,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.020]   and Jesus has died and resurrected,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.560]   and he's even appeared to the disciples.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.100]   That happened in John 20.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.000]   We don't have time to go into it,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.960]   but he's ascended, he's back alive,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.640]   and he shows up to the guys,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.000]   and then Jesus goes off again,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   and Peter and the disciples are wondering,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.600]   like, is God done with us?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.080]   All of us abandoned him in our worst hour of need,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   and so we're gonna look at four brief takeaways
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.840]   from this story, and then we're gonna walk through,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.280]   and I believe God wants to set some people free tonight
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.200]   and lead a life where you're not gonna carry,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.720]   you can clap for that, you're not gonna carry
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.300]   for the rest of your life what he carried.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.920]   All right, this is just getting weird now, okay?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.400]   So let me, let me,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.940]   oh, y'all are out of control, man.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.600]   All right, John chapter 21, but before I go there,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.640]   I'm gonna read John chapter 20, because, thank you,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.080]   John chapter 20, because it's a really interesting take.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.360]   The way that chapter 20 ends, it's as though the book
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.720]   is over, and yet John introduces
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.400]   an entire new chapter afterwards.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.300]   In other words, let me read this.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.000]   This is the end of John chapter 20,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.080]   where it says this in verse 30.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.520]   At the very end, you would think the book is over.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.240]   Now, Jesus did many other signs in his presence,
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.600]   or in the presence of the disciples,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.120]   which are not written in this book,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   but these, everything I just talked about,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.080]   the last 20 chapters, are written so that you may believe
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.760]   Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   and that by believing, you may have life in his name.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.360]   Now, that is a great ending, and it's as though John
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.920]   is like, oh, man, through the Spirit of God,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.840]   inspired, oh, there's one more story I need to write,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.540]   because there's some unfinished business related to Jesus
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.280]   and the leader of the disciples, who is Peter,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.400]   and he launches into this interaction
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.460]   that would forever change the church in general
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.120]   and Peter and his ministry in life,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.440]   and John knows this, and he launches into that story.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.800]   He says this in verse one.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.000]   After this, this being the resurrection,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.960]   Jesus appearing, Thomas, you know, stick your hands,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   see my scars, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.120]   by the Sea of Tiberias, which is another name
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.640]   for the Sea of Galilee, and he revealed himself in this way.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.000]   Now, Simon Peter, Thomas, called the twin,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.260]   Nathaniel of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.660]   that's James and John, and two other disciples were together.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.640]   So, there's seven total out of the 11,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.560]   'cause there's not 12 disciples, now there's 11,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.620]   'cause Judas is out, and he drops James and John
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.200]   and Nathaniel and Peter and Thomas,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.900]   and then perhaps the greatest,
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.240]   like, you know that moment where somebody has a picture
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.160]   and they tag everybody in the friend group except for you
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.560]   and you're on social media and you're like,
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.780]   what the heck, man?
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.300]   This is probably the greatest example of that of all time,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.780]   because it's eternal, and that he says,
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.880]   there was James and John,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.240]   then there were these two other guys
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.780]   that don't even get mentioned,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.740]   and Simon Peter said to them, I'm going fishing.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.140]   And they said to him, we'll go with you.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.120]   They went out and they got into the boat,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.840]   but that night they caught nothing.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.160]   Just as the day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.880]   yet the disciples didn't know it was Jesus.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.740]   And he called out to them, children, do you have any fish?
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.960]   And they answered him, no.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.680]   He said, cast your net on the right side of the boat
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.780]   and you'll find some.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.120]   And so they cast it,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.240]   and they were not able to bring in the net
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.000]   because of the quantity of fish.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.840]   That disciple whom Jesus loved,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.260]   which is how John describes himself
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260]   over and over in his book, you gotta love it,
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.400]   therefore said to Peter, it is the Lord.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   Now when Simon Peter heard it was the Lord,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.240]   he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.440]   and he threw himself into the sea
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.880]   to begin to swim towards the sea.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.400]   The other disciples came in the boat,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.680]   dragging the net full of fish,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   for they were not far off from land, about 100 yards off.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.360]   The first thing I wanna highlight
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.340]   is how Jesus runs towards us in our shame.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.640]   Jesus runs towards us in our shame.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.400]   So what just happened, the disciples are there
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.100]   and Peter says, I'm going fishing.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.920]   Now Jesus had said, I'm gonna meet you on a mountain
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   near Galilee, and Peter's not at the mountain,
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.520]   and he's certainly not where he's supposed to be
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.420]   because he's carrying all this shame
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.320]   from a decision that he had made.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.720]   This is about three weeks after Jesus was crucified,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.800]   and on the night before Jesus was crucified,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.240]   he had his boys together
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.600]   and he had what we call the last supper.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.000]   At the last supper, he sits down, they have this meal,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.240]   and during the conversation,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.860]   Jesus says, every one of you will abandon me.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.360]   It's been written that God will strike the shepherd
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.440]   and the sheep will scatter.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.680]   Jesus says, you're all gonna abandon.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.780]   And Peter stands up and he says,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.240]   in several different accounts, in Luke 22, he said,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.360]   Lord, I'm ready to go, Luke 22, verse 33 and 34,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.960]   I'm ready to go to prison, even death with you.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   In another version or in Mark's point of view,
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   he says, even if all of these guys abandon you,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   I never will.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.000]   And Jesus says, I tell you, Peter,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.720]   the rooster will not crow this day until you deny me.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.900]   You deny three times that you even know me.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.960]   And Peter goes, there's no way.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.800]   They finish the meal, they go out to pray in this garden,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.640]   all of a sudden, Judas shows up with this temple guard group
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.400]   and they arrest Jesus.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.720]   And they take him away and they lead him
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.680]   and they put him on trial.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.440]   And Peter, we're told, follows at a distance
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   that he's watching and he's waiting to see
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.680]   what's gonna happen, and he shows up
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   and Jesus is brought to the high priest's house
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.080]   and he's put on trial there.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   And Peter follows and basically walks outside
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   the courtyard to watch and see what's gonna happen.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.680]   In Luke 22, it tells us this, they seize Jesus
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.720]   and they led him away, bringing him
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.960]   to the high priest's house.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.600]   Peter was following at a distance.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.520]   And when they had kindled a fire, a charcoal fire,
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   in the middle of the courtyard and sat down,
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.420]   Peter sat among them.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.080]   Then a servant girl, seeing him in the light
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.600]   and looking closely at him said,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.780]   this man was also with Jesus.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.440]   But Peter denied it, saying, woman, I don't know him.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.000]   A little later, someone else saw him and said,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.160]   you are one of them.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.080]   And Peter said, man, I'm not.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.700]   Not one of Jesus' followers.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.820]   After an interval of about an hour,
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.960]   still another insisted, saying,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   certainly this man was also with him.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.880]   He's a Galilean.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.200]   Peter's accent, we're told in another account,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.040]   had given him away.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.920]   And Peter begins to call down curses on Jesus,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.000]   basically to reflect, would someone who knows him
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.400]   curse him like this?
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.520]   And it says, man, I do not know what you're talking about,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.120]   Peter said.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.860]   And immediately while he was still speaking,
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.160]   the rooster crowed.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.280]   And the Lord turned from inside the courtyard
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.380]   and he looked at Peter.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.660]   And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.620]   how he had said before the rooster crows today,
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.960]   you will deny me three times.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.420]   And he went out and he wept bitterly.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:30.440]   Shortly after Jesus is led away, he's crucified.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.840]   He's buried and three days later, he rises.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.460]   Like I said, he showed up and he appeared
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.260]   to all the disciples, but Peter's still covered in shame.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.480]   Over in Jesus' worst moment in life,
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.320]   I denied even knowing him.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.680]   The man that I'd followed for three years,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.720]   I saw him allow blind people to see.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.460]   I saw him feed 5,000 people with a Lunchable.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.600]   I saw him allow people to walk again
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.360]   who'd been lame their entire life.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.460]   And then after three years and hours after saying,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.260]   I'll die for you, to a middle school girl
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.660]   and two other men, Peter says,
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.940]   I've never even seen the man before.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.500]   And he's covered in shame.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.740]   And he's wondering what a lot of us want
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.060]   when our shame hits us.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.120]   Like, does God want anything to do with me?
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.560]   Is God done with me?
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.740]   He's back alive, but I don't know
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.540]   if he wants me back at all.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.460]   In Mark 16, we're even told that when the angels
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.260]   announce Jesus' resurrection, Mary Magdalene,
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.240]   these Marys, they show up on the third day, Sunday, Easter.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.220]   They go to the tomb, it's empty.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.740]   There's an angel there.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.980]   And the angel says, he's not here, he's alive.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.060]   Jesus is alive.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.740]   Go tell the disciples and Peter
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.580]   that he's coming to meet them.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.320]   Now, why would he say, and Peter?
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.380]   He is a disciple.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.840]   Maybe because he knew that Peter wouldn't have come
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.460]   had they not say, and Peter.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.080]   But Peter thinks, man, I'm gonna go back to what I know.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.220]   I'm going fishing.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.020]   It had been three years since Peter had been out fishing.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.940]   And the day that Jesus showed up and he said,
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.620]   I'm gonna change you from fishing in the sea
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.080]   to being a fisher of men.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.680]   And Peter goes out and decides, I'm going back.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.020]   That's a curve ball.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.480]   This is all for effect.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.220]   And it was a dark and stormy night.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.440]   And behold, Jesus.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.020]   Should we just go movie style
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.720]   or throw the Mavs game on or what?
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.340]   We're still live on video.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.820]   So if you're tuning in, man, that's creepy, but.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.940]   Wait, anything else you should know?
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.140]   Are these gonna be down?
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.660]   Four minutes.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.380]   This is great, man, all right.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.000]   We're back to old school tent revivals, okay?
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.140]   So Peter is wondering,
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.180]   is Jesus want anything to do with me?
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.260]   And all of us have been in a moment
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.980]   where man's shame can drive us from God.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.380]   Some key things that ends up happening in people's life
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.820]   is a lot of you guys grew up in church
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.580]   and you ended up losing your virginity
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.640]   at some point in high school
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.700]   and making one mistake after the next, after the next.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.340]   And you just been running ever since.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.540]   And you showed up at 25 here
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.220]   and you had a relationship with God
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:47.220]   and you're trying to get back in the relationship you had.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.500]   But you've been running
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.200]   because when you are honest with yourself,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.380]   it's just shame, guilt that you're carrying.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.660]   And Peter's in that moment where he's going,
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.420]   I don't know that God wants anything to do with me.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.120]   And so he's going out fishing and Jesus shows Peter,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.000]   you think this is about you?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.280]   You think that my relationship with you
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.220]   is dependent on your faithfulness to me?
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.020]   No, Peter, I'm not done with you.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.060]   He shows up on the shore,
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.000]   performs a miracle that I'll highlight again,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.140]   just like the miracle the day that he called Peter
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.740]   to come follow him in Luke 5.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.260]   And Peter wrapped up in love,
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.260]   jumps into the water and swims towards Jesus.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.180]   But I just wanna highlight,
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.980]   I mean, Peter, he ran from God to go fishing,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.720]   but shame can lead us to run from God in all kinds of ways.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.580]   Shame is the reason why some of us,
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.280]   when you think about dating someone,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.780]   you hear us talk about dating relationships
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.620]   all the time at the porch,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.500]   and we describe, hey, this is the person to look for,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.700]   and this is the type of way you should date,
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.060]   and this is who you should seek to be.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.100]   And let me just be blunt.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.700]   A lot of you guys think, man, dude,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.100]   I don't know what fantasy world he lives in,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.900]   but I've never met anybody like that.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.640]   And anybody that is like that, godly guy or godly girl,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.580]   they don't want anything to do with me.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.260]   And you see yourself as damaged goods
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.260]   because you carry shame from sexual sin,
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.900]   from dysfunctional relationships,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.500]   and it's led you to settle.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.160]   'Cause you think, man, whatever they're describing,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.700]   I'm not a good enough person to have that kind of thing.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   Shame can lead us to run from relationships
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.460]   in our past, just run from relationships in general.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.180]   I can't believe that I did that.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.740]   And shame is having tremendous power
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.940]   over a lot of our lives.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.780]   And for Peter, like him, turning and running
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.020]   from God's call.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.540]   Shame can lead us to not be willing to share our faith
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.340]   because I'm going, man, I'm just a hypocrite.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.820]   These friends, they know I could share,
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.460]   like, God is working in my life,
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.300]   but I would be sharing with these friends,
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.900]   and they just know me, they know my story,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.060]   and I'm too ashamed.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.740]   Shame is why I can't believe some of you guys
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.980]   are not serving and using your gifts
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.460]   and being a part of leading the next generation
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.140]   and serving in younger ministries
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.620]   because you feel like you're not good enough.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.820]   And it's shame.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.460]   And Jesus shows up on that shore
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.840]   to showcase to Peter and to you,
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.080]   I pursue those who are shamed,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.380]   who should be ashamed and who are covered in shame.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.660]   And I wanna change that, Peter.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.080]   And Peter experiences it.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.820]   Shame is the reason, often we run,
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.980]   it's been that way since the beginning,
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.020]   since Genesis chapter three.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.460]   You know what happened in Genesis chapter three,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.900]   Adam and Eve, they eat the apple,
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.060]   and then it says that they ran and hid.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.260]   And God called out to them and pursued them.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.140]   He said, Adam and Eve, where are you?
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.460]   And they said, we were ashamed.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.620]   And so we ran and hid.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.380]   What's interesting is our natural inclination
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.100]   when we feel shame over, you know,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.880]   a substance addiction, pornography that you promised
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.320]   you'd never go back to,
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.820]   crossing those physical boundaries you said
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.020]   you never would, giving into a same-sex attraction,
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.620]   you're terrified somebody's gonna find out with it.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.500]   And our natural inclination is to run from God,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.900]   and I'm just gonna avoid it, and I'm gonna run away.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.640]   What's interesting is God's inclination,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.160]   ours is to run from him, his is to run towards us.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.360]   And he did so with Adam and Eve,
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.020]   and he does so here with Peter.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.240]   And he shows up and says, I'm not done with you,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.940]   'cause Jesus runs towards us.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.280]   My daughter, often, because she is like three
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.520]   or almost four, and she's one of the least
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.080]   coordinated individuals I've ever seen.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.120]   So she'll be walking along like she's Captain Jack Sparrow
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.980]   or something, and she will, eventually,
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.600]   she'll just fall, and it happens like seven times a day.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.520]   And she'll fall down, and she'll begin to cry,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.440]   and she's at that stage where she wants everything
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.600]   to be kissed, because that makes it better.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.560]   And so I run to her when she falls,
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   and then I pick her up, and all better.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.020]   Now, my heart is not that she would continue to fall,
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.920]   but my heart is also not, hey, come on,
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.760]   what are you gonna do?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.420]   You're four, you should've known this already,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.780]   you should be able to walk.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.900]   Why, because I love my daughter.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.760]   Now, let me ask you this.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:26.900]   The Bible says God is familiar with your everything,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.700]   your sin nature, the family of origin that you have,
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.680]   all the different ways that the temptations
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.800]   you struggle with came about,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.900]   the addictions that have marked your life,
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.120]   the broken family you were raised in,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.640]   the heartbreak you have felt.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.180]   Do you think the way I love my daughter,
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.580]   even when she falls, and I run towards her to pick her up,
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.480]   do you think God's capacity for love and care for you
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   when you fall, spiritually, sexually, in any way,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.680]   do you think I have more love for my daughter
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.480]   than God, eternal, perfect, holy Father has for you?
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.600]   He's going, Peter, this has never been about you, man.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.920]   You're covered in shame, and you think
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.440]   if only you had behaved, you would be worthy.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.680]   You've never been worthy.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.920]   But I run towards those who are ashamed
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.200]   and who are covered in shame to show them my love.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.240]   And my guess is, and I'm gonna move to the next point,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.120]   and all the other three are very quick.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.120]   My guess is something is beginning to click with Peter.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.960]   Why do I say that?
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.800]   Here's what's ironic.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.920]   If you've read the Bible, you know this story
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.020]   feels eerily similar to another story that happened.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.160]   I referenced it a second ago.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.920]   In Luke chapter five, it's the very first day
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.520]   Peter and Jesus ever meet.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.480]   Jesus shows up, huge crowds.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.440]   He can't project to all of them, so he says,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.660]   "Hey, Pete, I need to get in your boat."
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.480]   He gets in Peter's boat with him,
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.040]   and they go out a little bit off the water.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.200]   Jesus teaches the crowds.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.400]   At the end of the sermon, Jesus says, "Put your net in."
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.640]   Peter says, "Jeez, we've been fishing all night, bro.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.960]   "This is kinda what I do for a living.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.520]   "We didn't catch anything."
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.040]   And he's like, "Well, try the other side."
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.700]   "Well, I don't know if you know this, but fish,
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.680]   "it's like, it's not gonna be there
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.760]   "just 'cause it wasn't here.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.680]   "It doesn't work that way, but all right."
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.600]   And he throws it in.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   And all of a sudden, they get a catch that's so big,
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.960]   the boat begins to sink.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.560]   Very similar.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.640]   With one difference.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.700]   One huge difference.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:34.680]   In that moment, Peter throws himself to his knees and says,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.480]   "You need to go.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.440]   "I'm not a good person.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.120]   "You need to get away from me."
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.940]   And he realizes, "I'm in the presence of something
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.200]   "and someone divine, and I am not a good person."
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.920]   It says this in Luke chapter five.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.820]   And he fell down, Peter, and said, "Depart from me.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.580]   "I am a sinful man, Lord."
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.440]   And Jesus says, "Don't be afraid.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.200]   "From now on, you will be catching or fishing for men."
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.640]   The same incidence happens again.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.080]   Same miracle.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.320]   But this time, Peter doesn't fall on his knees
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.720]   and say, "Please get away from me."
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.200]   He dives in the water and moves towards Jesus
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.900]   as though it's beginning to click.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.760]   That God pursues the broken and the ashamed.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.600]   It's almost hilarious.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.780]   Peter is clearly one of those, like, you know,
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.000]   ready, shoot, aim kind of people
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.800]   because he throws his shirt on, he dumps in the water,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.400]   and the text reads as though, like, the disciples were like,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.660]   "We were actually really close,
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.460]   "but for some reason, Peter just wanted to get in
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.300]   "and swim towards him.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.480]   "It didn't make any logical sense."
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.760]   They're like, "All right, just let him go.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   "Let him keep going."
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.360]   And they get to the shore, likely even before Peter.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.880]   But Peter was doing what you do when you're in love.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.920]   You're not thinking.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.620]   You're just like, "Man, he's here.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.900]   "He's not done with me."
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.120]   And if you tune me out for the rest of the time,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.920]   here's what I want you to walk away with.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.480]   He's not done with you.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   No matter what your story is,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.240]   no matter what you think has put you beyond
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.980]   what God wants to do in your life,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.400]   that his love, his grace, himself, he's not done with you.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.320]   He wants more for you than you want for you.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.920]   And Peter's seeing all of that firsthand.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.440]   All right, I'm gonna keep moving.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.160]   Verse 20, or verse nine.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.580]   "When they got to the land, they saw a charcoal fire."
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.600]   It's really important, we're gonna come back to that.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.560]   "With fish laid out on it and bread.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.980]   "Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.200]   "'that you have just caught.'"
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.000]   So they got pita bread, fish, first fish tacos right here.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.520]   "So Simon went aboard and he hauled the net
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.580]   "full of large fish, 153 of them.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.420]   "And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.340]   "And Jesus said, 'You guys, come have breakfast.'
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.360]   "And they're sitting there at breakfast.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   "And verse 15, when they had finished breakfast,
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.520]   "Jesus begins to have a conversation with Simon Peter."
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.720]   And we discover later in verses
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.820]   that we're not gonna get to,
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.520]   that they end up going on a walk together,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.360]   just the two of them.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.400]   The reason I know that is because at the end of the verse,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.480]   or at the end of the chapter,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.080]   we're told that they're having this conversation,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.520]   and at one point, Peter looks back,
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.800]   and John has been following them the entire time.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.040]   And he's like, what is he doing?
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.080]   And so they're in this conversation walking together,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.920]   and Jesus begins to ask a series of questions.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.320]   And he says this, "Simon, son of John,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.680]   "do you love me more than these disciples?"
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.000]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.220]   He said, "Feed my lambs."
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.400]   He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.360]   "do you love me?"
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.940]   And Peter said, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.160]   He said, "Tend my sheep."
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.560]   He said to him a third time, "Simon, son of John,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   "do you love me?"
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.800]   And Peter was grieved,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.960]   because he said it a third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.920]   He said to him, "Lord, you know everything.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.400]   "You know that I love you."
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.560]   And Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.560]   Now, there's two things remarkable Jesus is doing here,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.960]   and I wanna pull these two points
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.840]   out of this text very quickly.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.960]   The first is that Jesus is doing what he does
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   for anyone who knows him.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.080]   Jesus redeems our past.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.760]   Why do I say that?
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.200]   Here's what just happened with Peter.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.080]   He shows up on the beach, charcoal fire.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.400]   Sits down, has a conversation.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.960]   Jesus wants him to say it three times.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.440]   Do you know the only other occasion
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   in all of the New Testament where there is a charcoal fire?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.800]   There's a lot of fires mentioned in the Bible.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.680]   There's only two charcoal fires ever mentioned.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   Here and that night where Peter sat around warming himself.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   And denied the Son of God.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.560]   Sense is one of the strongest, or the sense of smell
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.640]   is one of the strongest attachments
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.920]   to association of memories that we have.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.600]   It's been said to be stronger than any of the other senses.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.440]   And Jesus is going to redeem his past
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   and recreate the moment of his betrayal and denial.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.600]   And say, "I'm not done with you."
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.560]   And sitting around that charcoal fire,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.920]   he says, "Peter, do you love me?"
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   And there were three denials.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.400]   And now he's saying three affirmations.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.560]   Because Jesus redeems.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.400]   What does redeem means?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.320]   It means to purchase, to exchange.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.400]   And he's exchanging.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.320]   Hey, that doesn't define you anymore.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.640]   I define you.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.480]   Your relationship with me is now what defines you.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.760]   He says, "Do you love me more than these?"
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.360]   Speaking about the other disciples.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.120]   'Cause Peter, remember, was the guy who said,
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.360]   "If everybody else doesn't follow you,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.040]   "I will to my death."
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:50.400]   And Peter is having all of that tragic failure replaced.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   And Jesus is saying, "That doesn't define you anymore.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.320]   "Because I am a God who redeems your past."
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.040]   Where I relate to Peter,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.480]   and maybe you can relate too,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.640]   is this feeling of like, man, I just,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.000]   I'm disappointing God again.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.360]   Like he looks at my life and he's like,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.840]   "Man, you should be a better leader.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   "You should be a better father.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.280]   "You should be a better husband.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.520]   "You should be a nicer person.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.760]   "You should be more generous.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.160]   "You should be a better,
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.080]   "just individual member of the church."
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.120]   And I can begin to think like, man, God,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.520]   he's just disappointed.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.560]   Or he wishes I would try a little harder.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.160]   Or I'm just kind of letting him down.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.640]   And Peter's confronted with all of that.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.840]   I'm sure God, when he looks at me, is disappointed in me.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.520]   And he's discovering,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.840]   you didn't disappoint me, Peter.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.160]   I told you this was gonna happen.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.440]   You didn't let me down and surprise me.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.480]   Because I'm God, and I'm what's called omniscient.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.320]   What does omniscient mean?
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.520]   It means I know everything.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.240]   Peter, before you denied me,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.720]   I told you you were going to deny me.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.360]   Like you bought this idea that, oh, I'm surprised,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.640]   and I didn't know about that,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.440]   and now you're really disappointed.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.680]   He knows all of that.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.640]   He knows all of Peter's story,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.200]   and he knows all of your story.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.240]   He knows every sin that is in front of you,
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.040]   you don't even know you're gonna commit.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.920]   And he doesn't want that, just like any loving father
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.720]   doesn't want anything that's gonna harm their children.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.680]   And yet that doesn't move him away from you.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.800]   What's the point of the gospel?
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.520]   That's why he moves towards you.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.360]   You didn't disappoint me.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.880]   He knows everything you have ever done, ever thought,
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.360]   every sin that you don't even realize was sin.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.760]   And he moves towards you, just like he did here with Peter.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   And he replaces and redeems that past,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.560]   and he's gonna say, you're not defined by that anymore.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.200]   In fact, I'm gonna recreate all of that experience
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.240]   and give a new memory in its place.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.680]   Because I'm a God who redeems your past.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.280]   I exchange it for something so much better.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.320]   My son recently lost his first tooth,
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.040]   and so we are tooth fairy people.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.360]   If you're not a tooth fairy person,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.800]   you do you, don't judge me.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   Most of you guys don't have kids anyway, so get off me.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.680]   Anyways, he had his first tooth lost,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.240]   and so we were like, oh, we're gonna do the thing
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.000]   where you put the tooth underneath the pillow,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.440]   and then you put cash there, which now as a parent,
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.000]   you realize that your parents,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.240]   there was no formula to this.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.000]   It basically was like, how much do you have in your wallet?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.280]   Do you have any cash?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.320]   So he gets five bucks, 'cause that's all I had,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   and so I put it under the thing, and I get the tooth.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.320]   Now, what else you don't realize,
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.160]   'cause most of you guys haven't lost teeth in a while,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.640]   is how disgusting a baby tooth is.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.560]   It's just a very like, what am I gonna do with this thing?
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.040]   It's just gonna go in the trash,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.340]   and I just gave $5 in exchange for this nasty little thing
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.880]   that was clearly not brushed enough,
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.320]   and we're just gonna throw it away.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.120]   And this exchange of something good for something gross.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.840]   And in a parallel way, and in a very serious way.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.480]   That's what the gospel is.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.760]   It is God saying, you bring your sin,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.740]   you bring all the decisions that mark your past,
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.120]   all the shame, all the guilt, everything you've ever done,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.520]   and I take all of those, and you get the glory
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.600]   and the righteousness of Jesus himself.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.280]   The exchange of something gross
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.520]   in exchange for something great.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.420]   And he's saying, Peter, this is what the whole message is.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.000]   It's not about you.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.400]   I pursue you in your shame, and I redeem you from your past.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.200]   And then, we see something else
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.720]   that he begins to lay out in that conversation.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.920]   He restores his purpose.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.160]   He's like, Peter, I'm not done with you.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.260]   I want you to feed my sheep.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.100]   What's that mean?
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.920]   Tend to my lambs.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.480]   He's describing the church, and he's saying,
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.560]   Peter, I want you to lead the church.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.800]   I want you to teach.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.280]   I want you to pour into.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.160]   I want you to share the gospel and be a part of leading.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.240]   That's what he's saying with the sheep metaphor
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.280]   that Jesus uses to describe his followers.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   I want you to lead, Peter.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.320]   I'm not just done with your past or changing it.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.640]   I'm restoring your purpose.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.480]   The third idea is Jesus restores our purpose.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.360]   I want you to feed my lambs.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.720]   Care for those young in the faith.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.820]   Tend to my sheep.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.880]   Care for those who are part of the faith.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.000]   Eventually, this clicked,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.880]   because Peter went from the coward to courageous,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.280]   and he went from Peter, who was going fishing,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.560]   to leading the church and getting over that shame.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.460]   Had that not happened, Peter, three weeks later,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.400]   is gonna go, and at Pentecost,
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.800]   which is the launching of the church,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.680]   he's gonna preach and lead the message,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.800]   and 3,000 people are gonna come to know Jesus,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.520]   all flowing from this moment,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.160]   that Jesus looks in his eyes and he says,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.700]   I'm not done with you.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.280]   No one in this room has denied the Son of God
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.080]   after walking personally with him for three years.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.840]   And if Jesus was not done with Peter,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.000]   if he's not done with me, he's not done with you,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   no matter what story you have.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.440]   And he wants to restore your purpose.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.400]   He wants to give purpose to your life.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.040]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.640]   And he looks at Peter and he says,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.840]   man, I'm not done with you.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.200]   And there's a world that is hurting and broken,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.720]   and I wanna restore you to your purpose.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:19.640]   I broke my hand about a year ago.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.640]   Something interesting happens when you break a bone.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.880]   It grows back stronger.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.000]   And whatever brokenness is in your life and in my life,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.160]   maybe it is from past decisions that you made,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.440]   whatever your story is,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   God wants to take that and heal it,
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.040]   and make it not just a source that formerly was broken
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.280]   and hurt, addicted,
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.460]   but something far stronger and greater,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.940]   and use that part of your story
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.240]   to minister to others all the time.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   You know what the best ministers,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.360]   the people who struggle with an abortion in their past are?
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.480]   Women who have that in their story.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.600]   There's a ministry called Worthmore,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.120]   all led by women at this church
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.720]   who've had that as a part of their story.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.200]   Some of the best ministers that I know of
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.160]   as it relates to pornography being in their story,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.200]   like it is mine,
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.320]   to care and help and come alongside and encourage men
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.460]   who are battling against, or women and men,
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.880]   who are battling against lustful thoughts
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.320]   are men who have that a part of your story.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.200]   God wants to take that and fuse it and make it stronger,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.040]   not weaker,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.920]   and he restores Peter and he restores purpose to him.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.800]   And the final observation, we see this, verse 18.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.840]   "Truly I say to you, when you were young,
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.380]   "you used to dress yourself
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.380]   "and you would walk wherever you wanted.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.960]   "But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.240]   "and another will dress you
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.140]   "and carry you to where you do not want to go.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.880]   "This he said to show what kind of death
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.100]   "Peter would glorify God by.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.640]   "And after saying this, he said to him, 'Follow me.'"
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.840]   It's a really interesting thing that he just shared.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.700]   He said, "Peter, when you were young,
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.180]   "you used to dress and you'd go wherever you want.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.320]   "There's gonna come a day, a few decades from now,
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.380]   "where somebody else is gonna lead you
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.320]   "where you don't wanna go,
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.820]   "and you're gonna stretch out your arms,
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.520]   "and that's gonna be how you die."
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:23.540]   The fourth idea we see is Jesus redefines our future.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.420]   Now, let me explain.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.640]   He just told Peter,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.560]   "Three weeks ago, you denied me
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.520]   "because you were afraid to die.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.740]   "You looked death in the face
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.980]   "and you were afraid to die for knowing me,
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.040]   "for your faith in me, and so you ran from it.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.660]   "You denied me, but there will come a day
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.400]   "where you will be willing to look death in the face,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.440]   "and you will go all in and say,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.980]   "Whatever the cost, he's worth it.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.700]   "And you will die for me, Peter.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.160]   "And you will go on to lead the church
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.860]   "like no other person other than Jesus ever has."
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.260]   Church history tells us that Jesus did rewrite his story.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.140]   In other words, the coward becomes courageous.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.980]   Why do I say that?
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.260]   Because eventually, his hands would be stretched out,
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.780]   which is a metaphor for crucifixion,
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.260]   and Peter would be crucified.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.780]   But in the face of that crucifixion,
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.480]   Peter, at the last moment, said, "Don't do it upside!
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.020]   "I am not worthy to die like my Savior.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.240]   "Turn me upside down."
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.900]   And he was crucified as blood rushed to his head,
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.800]   upside down.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:34.680]   For his faith in the Messiah, he denied.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.160]   And Jesus says, "Your story's gonna be rewritten, Peter,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.440]   "and you won't be known as Peter the coward.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:50.140]   "You, for my sake, will be willing
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.280]   "to go whatever the cost.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:59.460]   "I know him, I love him, and I will follow him."
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:05.400]   I wanna transition and invite you to do something tonight.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.800]   You were handed a sheet of paper,
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.880]   an index card on the way in.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.720]   I want you to take that out,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.640]   and I want you to write something on it.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   And I wanna be very specific about what I want you to write.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.440]   We did something like this a few months ago,
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.120]   and yet there are a lot of us that are either new,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.800]   or we're picking up and we're carrying things
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.380]   that, if we're being honest,
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.480]   they seep into how we think God thinks about us.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   And I want you to write on that card
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.960]   the thing that you feel shame and you feel guilt for,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.540]   you feel like it defines you,
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.320]   the thing that maybe right now you don't even wanna write
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.080]   'cause the person next to you doesn't even know
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.440]   that's a part of your story and you're afraid to.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.000]   And I want you to write it out and invite you to go
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.800]   at whatever point you're ready to go
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.320]   and drop it off at any of the bins and say,
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.920]   "I'm done with this.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.440]   "This doesn't define me anymore."
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.320]   'Cause here's the truth.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.880]   If you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.440]   if you have trusted that Jesus is the payment for your sin,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.080]   his death and resurrection, it doesn't define you anymore.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.680]   You can have an affair tomorrow with somebody who's married,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.920]   and it doesn't define you.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.860]   You know what does?
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.680]   If you are in Jesus, you are forgiven, you are clean,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.080]   you are healed, you are free, you are new.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.240]   That's what defines you for the rest of your life.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.540]   Listen to me very closely.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.420]   For the rest of your life,
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.120]   in the face of falling for temptation,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.320]   God doesn't want any more than,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.340]   "I want my kids to fall down."
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.080]   But that doesn't make her not my kid.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.600]   You are no longer defined by that.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.760]   If you are in Jesus, a lot of you are not in Jesus,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.280]   which means you are defined by those things.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.400]   But for those of us who are, you've been invited by God.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.240]   I'm gonna write this out.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.320]   This doesn't define me.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.040]   I carry this shame, I carry this weight,
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.280]   and I carry it with me in life,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.960]   and I'm deciding I'm not doing that anymore.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.640]   I'm gonna look the Savior in the eyes.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.720]   The same Savior that showed up to Peter and said,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.040]   "This doesn't define you.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   "I'm a God who chases after you
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.660]   "in spite of all the sin in your life.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.200]   "And I'm gonna redefine your past,
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.020]   "and I am redefining your future.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.920]   "I've got more for you, and I'm gonna give you purpose."
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.000]   And some of you guys won't do it,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.760]   and some of you guys are gonna write something
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.160]   that's honestly not even what you struggle with.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:15.400]   But some of you are gonna experience freedom.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.360]   It's nothing magic and paper,
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.620]   but it's deciding this doesn't define me anymore.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.460]   I'm done.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.680]   And I may struggle for the rest of my life,
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.480]   but I'm not gonna buy the lie
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.600]   that those struggles define me, 'cause He does.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.480]   And the band will come out here in a second,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.520]   and we'll have a chance.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.400]   But right now, wherever you're at, as they play,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.620]   just wanna invite you to write it out,
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.920]   whatever that is.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.420]   And our team this week is gonna go around.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.440]   You don't have to put your name.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.400]   We just wanna pray over it.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.240]   And you know what?
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.060]   Here's what we're gonna pray.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.440]   God, would you give them freedom from this,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.460]   where they believe that you are who you say you are,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.600]   and you have done what you did,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.380]   and you have done what you have said is accomplished.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.880]   It is finished.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.840]   And we'll have a chance to close out.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.520]   But there's been spread all throughout the room.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.880]   If you're in the balcony, there's some up there,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.360]   there's some down here, there's some over here,
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.040]   there's some back there.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.080]   And just whenever you're ready, man, I'm done.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:17.540]   (gentle music)
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.960]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.380]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.800]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.220]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.640]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.060]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.480]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.900]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:55.740]   (gentle music continues)
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:09.160]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:30.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.420]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.780]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.620]   (gentle music continues)
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:10.040]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.300]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.560]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:41.060]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.080]   (gentle music continues)
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:45:03.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.040]   (gentle music continues)
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.900]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:44.400]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:47:15.340]   (gentle music continues)
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:45.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:51.100]   - It's funny, I started with telling you
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.400]   kind of the plot of "Lion King."
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.280]   And if you remember,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.100]   the turning point for when he comes back,
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.060]   as silly as it was or silly as it is,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.280]   even to talk about Disney movies,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.860]   he's told to remember,
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   remember, remember who you are.
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   And something shifts.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.860]   And in a much more real and true way,
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   for the rest of your life, my hope is that when you fail,
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:34.360]   when you fall, when I fall,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.620]   'cause there's no perfect people on this stage,
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:42.120]   it's just sinful, broken people holding onto Jesus.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   You remember who you are and what defines you,
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.500]   which is Jesus.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.120]   And when temptation comes to tell you
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.920]   you are damaged, messed up, and how could you,
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.740]   you remember the Savior who runs after the shameful,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.820]   who redefines our past, who gives us purpose in this life,
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.660]   and is redefining and rewriting your story and mine.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.120]   Remember who he says that you are.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:16.660]   Which is the most true reality about who you are,
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:22.080]   forgiven, clean, new, alive, forever his.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.660]   And that never changes.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.420]   For those who are in Christ, let me pray.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.620]   Father, I thank you that you have done
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.780]   what only you can do, which is allow dead people
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.820]   to be made alive, spiritually speaking, by your Spirit.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.900]   Thank you that many of us have allowed Jesus
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.700]   in his work on the cross to be accepted in our life
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.320]   as the payment for our sin, his resurrection
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.160]   from the grave as proof of that payment.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.860]   And so would anyone who's never made that decision
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:51.460]   tonight be their night?
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.900]   Father, would you allow us to live lives
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.020]   that are free from shame and regret and guilt
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.940]   and all the different things that fight for our attention
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.360]   and push us away from you?
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.420]   And would we believe what you say about us?
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.300]   And would we run to you, the Father who has,
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.460]   since the moment we were born in this life
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.940]   until the moment we leave it, has been running towards us?
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.700]   We worship you now in song, amen.
