 [MUSIC PLAYING]

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,160
 Porch, how we doing?

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,560
 We doing OK tonight?

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,760
 Come on, let's go.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,720
 It's great to see you.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,960
 The brave and the bold, man.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,280
 You decided that you're not going

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
 to let any cold weather keep you back.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
 You decided to make it here in the room tonight.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,940
 So glad you did.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,240
 Also, so glad that we've got some friends joining us

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,840
 online tonight.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,440
 Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations,

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,520
 Porch Live Indie, Porch Live Scottsdale, Porch Live Fresno.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,240
 We love you guys.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,680
 So glad that you're tuning in with us this evening.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,200
 Well, chances are, if you're going to move cities,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,480
 you're more than likely going to do so because of work

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,840
 at some point in your life.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,340
 That's the case for some of you here.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,880
 Like you're in Dallas, Texas because your job brought you

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,380
 here.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,200
 You didn't necessarily choose to be here.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,160
 Your job required you to be here.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,600
 Or maybe you're tuning in and it's not that you live here.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,160
 You live wherever it is you are.

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,480
 And it's because work just required it, man.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,920
 You decided to make the move.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,440
 This happened for me a little bit later in life

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
 than it did for many, many young adults.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,840
 You see, I went to Texas A&M University.

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,560
 There you are.

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
 Can always count on you guys.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
 And I actually lived in College Station

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,840
 for a little bit of time after I graduated.

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,560
 I decided to hang out, catch a little bit more of the scenery.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,440
 But eventually, I did get an offer

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,960
 that took me away from the city and into Houston, Texas.

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,200
 I didn't know anything about Houston.

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
 Brooke and I, we're not from there.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,400
 We were unfamiliar with the area.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,400
 So all we know is that at some point,

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
 the Astros decided to cheat in pursuit

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,040
 of winning the World Series.

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
 That's all we knew.

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,040
 We didn't know much else.

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,720
 And so what we decided is we've got

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,920
 to get to know the landscape of the land a little bit.

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,600
 And we have to find an apartment as soon as possible

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
 because my transition was coming very, very quickly.

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
 So we took a weekend.

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
 We booked a bunch of reservations.

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
 We decided to go through a variety of apartments.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
 And we landed on one that felt really good.

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,260
 You see, the apartment that we found,

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,640
 it was in a really good location, a nice pocket of town.

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,440
 It was near good restaurants, not far from my workplace.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,900
 It was a first floor unit,

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,800
 which is great if you're carrying groceries.

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
 And so we were really excited about it,

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,960
 except there was one minor catch.

64
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,460
 And that catch is we weren't actually able to tour

65
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,100
 the unit that we were planning to lease,

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,940
 which I don't know if you've ever been in that spot,

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,740
 but that's a pretty uneasy feeling

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,380
 because you don't necessarily know what you're going to get.

69
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,720
 Sure, you can look around

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,700
 and you can assess some of the quality of the place,

71
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
 but you really want to step foot into the actual apartment

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,400
 that you're going to call your own.

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,760
 Our property manager understood our uneasiness.

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,720
 And so to assuage our fear,

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,000
 she decided to take us through a model unit,

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,520
 a unit that was identical to the one we'd be moving into.

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,400
 And so we walked in and it was nice.

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,480
 Like it was like freshly painted walls and cleaned floors

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
 and new light fixtures.

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,040
 And there was a fireplace in the living area.

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
 It felt great.

82
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,060
 So we decided, you know what, let's take the risk.

83
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,780
 We're going to sign the lease.

84
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,120
 So the weekend finally comes.

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
 We make our way from College Station.

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,940
 We drive down to Houston, Texas, and we're excited.

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,060
 Like this is a new chapter of life.

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,460
 Like this is a new adventure for Brooke and I.

89
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,800
 Like this is a new job, yes,

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
 but it's also a new city and it's new people.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
 And this is a new home for us as well.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,720
 And so we decide to get to the apartment

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,060
 and collect the keys and make our way to our unit.

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,580
 And as we go to unlock the door,

95
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,160
 we push it open and to our horror,

96
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,320
 it looked nothing like what we had been promised.

97
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,120
 We had been promised one thing,

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,480
 but we were given something else entirely.

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
 Like in place of the walls being freshly painted,

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,280
 they were freshly stained with, I still don't know what.

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,760
 It was gross to look at.

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,820
 Instead of the floors being perfectly cleaned,

103
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,260
 there were little hairballs floating around

104
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,700
 in the corners of the apartment.

105
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,320
 So much so that I can actually tell you the color

106
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,780
 of the previous tenants hair.

107
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,860
 Where we thought that we were gonna get an apartment

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,460
 that backed up to this running trail

109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,740
 and this quaint little Creek

110
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,220
 that kind of cut through the woodland forest.

111
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,220
 Like what we found instead was a stinking smelling swamp.

112
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,800
 We were set into an apartment,

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,140
 the likes of which not only missed our expectations,

114
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,020
 but like mocked our expectations.

115
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,660
 Like we had been promised one thing,

116
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,620
 but we were given something else entirely.

117
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,980
 You ever been in that spot?

118
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,560
 Has that ever been your reality?

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
 Maybe it's not the place you live.

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,720
 Maybe it was instead a show that you loved.

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,280
 Like you watched every episode.

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,220
 Like you made sure to track with the characters.

123
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,840
 You felt like you grew up alongside of them.

124
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,220
 And then finally the final season shows up

125
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,280
 and you've been waiting for this moment.

126
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,360
 You can't wait for it to all drop.

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
 And you sit down and you're like,

128
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,400
 what the heck just happened?

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,760
 This show did not finish the way

130
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,260
 that it was supposed to finish.

131
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,100
 Maybe it wasn't that.

132
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,880
 Maybe it was instead you bought a piece of furniture.

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240
 You know, the perfect final addition to your living space.

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,880
 It was at the perfect price.

135
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,280
 And sure it came from Ikea,

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 but it said some assembly would already be completed.

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,400
 And yet it showed up on your doorstep

138
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,360
 and you realize no, no assembly has been completed.

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,120
 All assembly is in fact required.

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,160
 Maybe it's not something so trivial.

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,000
 Maybe it's actually something

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,120
 a little bit more material than that.

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
 Maybe it wasn't that you moved jobs

144
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
 or you moved to a new city because of a new job,

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,280
 but you actually earned a new promotion.

146
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
 It was like, oh my gosh,

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,820
 like this is everything that I've wanted.

148
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,480
 Like I'm in a new city, sure.

149
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,000
 I'm in a new department, great.

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,880
 But man, I'm finally getting to work in the position

151
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,120
 that I've longed for to a boss that I actually respect

152
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,840
 until you realize that boss is a real piece of work.

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,660
 And the job is not nearly as fulfilling as you thought.

154
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,880
 That's a material disappointment.

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
 Maybe it wasn't that.

156
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,000
 Maybe finally you got up the courage to ask her out.

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,580
 You've been reading the signs.

158
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,880
 You knew like the moment had arrived.

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,440
 And so you boldly walked across the room

160
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,680
 and you asked her if she had plans Friday night

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,240
 and you to your horror learned

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,340
 and she didn't have any interest in dating you.

163
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,480
 She only had interest in flirting with you.

164
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,720
 But what do you do when the disappointment

165
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
 goes even further than that?

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
 Like when the disappointment,

167
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,920
 it affects more than your life alone.

168
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,580
 It actually affects your soul too.

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Because the disappointment, it isn't just situational.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,440
 Like it's not just out there in the world.

171
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,380
 It's actually spiritual.

172
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,040
 It's in here in a room like this

173
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,160
 amongst a people like us coming from a guy like me.

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,700
 What do you do when you face disappointment in the church?

175
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,760
 When you trusted that pastor,

176
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
 you felt safe with that leader,

177
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,200
 you thought your peers, the Christians around you

178
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,660
 were supposed to be innocent until they weren't.

179
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,440
 What do you do in that moment

180
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,420
 when you face that level of betrayal?

181
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,040
 Well, for many of you, you deconstruct.

182
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,760
 You do what we described as a week one.

183
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,380
 Like you went through a crisis of faith

184
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,120
 that led at least to a reevaluation of your Christianity

185
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,320
 and at most to a total abandonment of it.

186
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,540
 And honestly, like who can blame you?

187
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,120
 Like I won't bore you with the stats,

188
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,200
 but if you look at the trends in our culture,

189
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,220
 more young adults today are leaving the church,

190
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,080
 not because their devious atheistic professor

191
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,140
 finally got to them,

192
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,520
 but because a religious altruistic minister

193
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,860
 actually failed them.

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,920
 Many people are leaving as a result of that.

195
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,880
 Like whether it was perpetuating a system of abuse

196
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
 instead of calling out sin,

197
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,000
 defending some political power

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,560
 rather than loving their neighbors,

199
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,280
 frequenting massage parlors for secret sexual favors,

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,480
 controlling the headlines to hide some hypocrisy,

201
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,500
 or defending a leader as opposed to holding him accountable

202
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,720
 for his actions.

203
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,760
 Many in our generation, some of you included,

204
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
 you just can't get on board with this.

205
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,320
 Like if this is what's true of them,

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,640
 then why would I ever want that to be true of me?

207
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,480
 If that's you, I'm really glad you're here.

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,080
 Because though that may be true for the ethereal them,

209
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,420
 it's not at all true of him.

210
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,440
 It's not true of Jesus.

211
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,400
 Like yes, the church can hurt, but Christ can save.

212
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,520
 Christ can save, and so often he saves those

213
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,480
 that the church tries to hurt.

214
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
 You see it all throughout his life.

215
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,560
 Like he identified with Zacchaeus, that wee little man.

216
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,000
 Like he decided that despite everyone's ridicule,

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,480
 he actually wanted to go and be hosted at his house.

218
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
 Like he healed the bleeding woman,

219
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,920
 the very woman that the rest of society

220
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,760
 had decided to extort instead.

221
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,440
 He wanted to heal her.

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,480
 He touched the leper,

223
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,220
 that guy that nobody wanted anything to do with.

224
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,080
 Don't touch him, he'll make you unclean.

225
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,040
 Jesus said, "No, I won't only heal him.

226
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,320
 "I will actually touch him myself,

227
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,480
 "and I will identify with him personally."

228
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
 He pursued the demoniac,

229
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,560
 that guy that lived in a place no one went to,

230
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,440
 and he did some things that nobody wanted.

231
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,600
 Jesus decided to go for that guy all by himself.

232
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,900
 He defended Mary.

233
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,180
 Like when she sat in the seat of the disciple,

234
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,680
 at his feet, listening to his teaching,

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,360
 and the rest of his disciples ridiculed her,

236
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,760
 he actually defended her instead.

237
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,600
 He welcomes tax collectors, sinners, prostitutes.

238
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,560
 He breaks bread with them,

239
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,000
 though the rest of the religious

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
 would scrutinize him for it.

241
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,960
 You see, Jesus did for them

242
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,160
 what I think he wants to do for some of you tonight.

243
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,800
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew 23.

244
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,120
 Matthew 23.

245
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,160
 Let me just say this too, from the outset,

246
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,400
 we've got some technical difficulties.

247
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,600
 The scripture will not be behind me tonight.

248
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,040
 My points will not be behind me tonight.

249
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,280
 Some of you look really disappointed in that reality.

250
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,880
 You had expectations, and they just didn't get met tonight.

251
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,840
 Here's what I would say.

252
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,160
 As we were fielding this issue a moment ago,

253
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,020
 I think the enemy really doesn't want this to happen.

254
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,280
 I think he's really terrified about the possibilities

255
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,800
 of what could take place in this room

256
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,280
 over the course of these next few moments together.

257
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,100
 So be patient with us.

258
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,920
 As we read, I'll go slow.

259
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
 Why Matthew chapter 23?

260
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,800
 Because we've been in a series called "Deconstructed."

261
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,960
 And the whole idea behind it

262
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,160
 is we wanna help you rebuild your reality.

263
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
 You see, we think there's a way

264
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,760
 to actually question your faith without losing it.

265
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,200
 Like, I think it's actually possible

266
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,400
 to contend with your confusion, to face your frustrations,

267
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,360
 and not just deconstruct parts of your belief,

268
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,080
 but actually reconstruct something strong instead.

269
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,220
 And if you were here two weeks ago,

270
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,280
 then what you know is that this is part two

271
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,720
 of a talk rooted in this specific passage

272
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
 that we're looking at tonight.

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,120
 In this passage, Jesus comes to the Pharisees

274
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
 and the scribes, and he calls them out.

275
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,000
 Pharisees and scribes

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
 are some of the religious leaders of his day.

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,440
 And so he decides to call them out,

278
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,880
 confront them through a series of woes.

279
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,560
 And what we know is that the context of this conversation

280
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
 is the last week of Jesus's life.

281
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,640
 It's actually a Tuesday in Holy Week.

282
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
 Jesus is repping Tuesdays, you know?

283
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,880
 And so he decides to call out these religious leaders

284
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
 the last week of his life.

285
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,720
 Now, if you had one week of life to live,

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
 what would you do with it?

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,080
 My guess, I could be wrong,

288
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,000
 but my guess is you're probably

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,760
 not exposing religious corruption.

290
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,320
 But that's what Jesus does.

291
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,120
 Like, you think you have an issue with Christian hypocrisy?

292
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,400
 Jesus has more.

293
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,480
 And what we see as he calls out the religious leaders

294
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
 is that he pronounces seven woes against them.

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,240
 A woe is a judgment.

296
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,360
 And so he calls them out for a variety of ways

297
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,400
 that they've led the people not closer to God,

298
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,680
 but further from God.

299
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,320
 And as he pronounces these woes,

300
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,920
 we know that we caught four of them

301
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,200
 the last time we were together.

302
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,040
 And those four, just to recap,

303
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,120
 to keep you up to speed in case you missed it,

304
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
 were that you should beware of those

305
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,000
 who stress aptitude over attitude.

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
 Beware those who stress aptitude over attitude.

307
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,720
 That was the first thing that Jesus warned us of.

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,440
 The second thing was beware those

309
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,960
 who convert to their cause rather than the kingdom.

310
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,320
 Beware of those who convert to their cause

311
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
 rather than the kingdom.

312
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,480
 The third of those woes was beware of those

313
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,360
 who leverage authority to escape accountability.

314
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,340
 Beware of those who leverage their authority

315
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,040
 to escape accountability.

316
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
 And then lastly, beware of those

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,960
 who emphasize small matters over big ones.

318
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,440
 Beware of those who emphasize small matters

319
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,760
 over big matters.

320
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,000
 Those were the first four woes.

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,480
 We talked about that two weeks ago.

322
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,400
 You can go catch the message

323
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,440
 if you wanna actually hear the explanation,

324
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
 interpretation of all of that.

325
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,160
 Tonight, we're gonna be looking at the last three.

326
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,200
 Here's what you need to know about these seven woes.

327
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
 These seven woes are warnings for us

328
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,020
 against the dangers of religiosity.

329
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,720
 But it's not just that it's gonna provide a warning,

330
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,520
 it's also going to provide a way in which we should walk

331
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,440
 as we move in faith.

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
 That's what we're gonna see.

333
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,080
 So the last three woes are what we're gonna find here

334
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,640
 tonight.

335
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,380
 Now, I should say this before I hop in.

336
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:03,380
 It is sobering for me to teach through Jesus's,

337
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,660
 Jesus's judgments against the religious leaders,

338
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,360
 knowing full well that I am no exception,

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
 that I myself stand in a seat where these same truths

340
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,520
 would apply to me very directly.

341
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,960
 It doesn't escape me the reality that that's the case.

342
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,720
 I'm grateful for the way that God has worked to refine me,

343
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
 even just in studying it.

344
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,800
 And so we're all subject to what this teaches tonight.

345
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,680
 This is a scripture of great consequence for me

346
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,040
 as it is for you.

347
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,640
 So let's get into it together, okay?

348
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 Matthew chapter 23, if you have a Bible,

349
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,880
 we're gonna start in verse 25.

350
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,720
 It says this,

351
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,160
 woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,

352
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
 for you clean the outside of the cup and the plate,

353
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,640
 but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

354
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,400
 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup

355
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,800
 and the plate that the outside may also be clean.

356
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,820
 The first thing that Jesus warns us tonight

357
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,280
 is that we should beware of those who prioritize image

358
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,460
 over innocence.

359
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,600
 Beware of those who prioritize image over innocence.

360
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,120
 Now, I don't know about you,

361
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,960
 but when I read a couple of verses like that,

362
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,400
 I love it whenever the Bible

363
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,600
 just kind of jumps into my reality.

364
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,800
 Like it engages me right where I am

365
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,460
 because I'm pretty particular when it comes to the dishes.

366
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,300
 You know what I mean?

367
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,920
 I'm not the guy that takes dishes with crumbs and food scum

368
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,200
 and just throws them in the dishwasher.

369
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
 I don't believe that that works very effectively.

370
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,480
 You may be like-minded to myself.

371
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,040
 You believe that it needs to be scrubbed

372
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,400
 very cleanly on the inside.

373
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,920
 Otherwise the dishwasher is not gonna get the job done.

374
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,720
 Jesus is kind of talking about that,

375
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
 but he's also talking about a little bit more.

376
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
 You see, what you need to know

377
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,000
 is there's a deeper layer of meaning

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,420
 to the analogy that Jesus is addressing here.

379
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,860
 He's targeting very directly the Pharisees

380
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,560
 because according to Jewish law,

381
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,100
 different rabbinical camps at this time,

382
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,720
 they argued when a cup or a plate

383
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,040
 was considered ritually clean.

384
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,920
 So one camp, they said that that cup was ritually clean

385
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,920
 whenever the outside of it was cleansed.

386
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,240
 The other camp said, no, no, no, that's not the case.

387
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,040
 This cup is ritually clean

388
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,120
 whenever the inside of it is ritually cleansed.

389
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,960
 Why does that matter?

390
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,720
 Because Jesus launches into that debate and he says,

391
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,760
 guys, it's not so much about the cup.

392
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,120
 This is much more about you.

393
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,760
 You clean yourself up on the outside,

394
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,540
 but you are filthy on the inside.

395
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,080
 You might look externally beautiful,

396
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,560
 but you are internally wicked.

397
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,160
 You see, Jesus wants us to know

398
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,160
 that true faith is about so much more than basic obedience.

399
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,840
 It's about so much more than just doing the right things

400
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,860
 and saying the right things and looking the right ways.

401
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,680
 It's about so much more than basic obedience.

402
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,280
 It's actually about innocence.

403
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,720
 Innocence, that you don't just do the right things,

404
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,960
 you mean them, like they come from a pure heart within.

405
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,120
 That it's not just what you do that matters,

406
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,640
 but it's how you do it that ultimately matters.

407
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,040
 So let me give you some perspective

408
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,080
 on what Jesus is trying to say here with this cup analogy.

409
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,760
 You've read about the Trojan War, in case you haven't.

410
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,700
 What you need to know is that the Greeks

411
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,160
 are squaring off against the city of Troy

412
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 and they decide to leave a surprise gift

413
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,100
 for the city of Troy.

414
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,440
 They create a Trojan horse.

415
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,880
 It's an infamous gift because the city of Troy looks at it

416
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 and says, "This is a peace offering,"

417
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,740
 because it was beautiful on the outside.

418
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,840
 And yet tucked away within,

419
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,320
 that Trojan horse was not something beautiful,

420
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,060
 but something very lethal.

421
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,160
 You see, it looked like it had all the trappings

422
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,240
 of innocence on the outside,

423
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,400
 but inside it was anything but innocent.

424
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,040
 It was filled with soldiers

425
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,840
 that could not penetrate the walls,

426
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,560
 lest they tricked the city of Troy into letting them inside

427
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,720
 and they raided the city from within.

428
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
 And Jesus is looking at the Pharisees and the scribes

429
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,640
 and he's saying, "Hey, that's kind of like you guys.

430
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
 "You look beautiful out here.

431
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,260
 "You look trustworthy,

432
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,240
 "but you're actually quite treacherous."

433
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,160
 That's why he calls them hypocrites.

434
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,960
 Like in the original language,

435
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,340
 when you read this in the Greek,

436
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,280
 well, that's not quite the original language.

437
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,040
 It's the earliest manuscript that we have.

438
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,160
 When you read it there, the word for hypocrite,

439
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,840
 it is the idea of an actor or a pretender.

440
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,600
 It's someone that looks like something on the outside,

441
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,400
 but is actually something very different on the inside.

442
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,560
 Like they have all the markings of good men,

443
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,680
 and yet they have none of the motives.

444
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,160
 Instead, they're motivated by what Jesus says is greed

445
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
 and self-indulgence.

446
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,200
 Like they have a lust for public recognition

447
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,400
 and they lack self-control.

448
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,380
 So much so that earlier in the chapter,

449
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,540
 Jesus warns the rest of the crowd,

450
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,820
 people like you and me,

451
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,260
 of what we should look out for

452
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,540
 when it comes to people like this.

453
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,720
 He says in Matthew 23, if you go back up to verse five,

454
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,980
 "They do all their deeds,"

455
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,540
 talking about the religious leaders,

456
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,260
 "to be seen by others.

457
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,760
 "For they make their phylacteries broad

458
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,540
 "and their fringes long."

459
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,300
 These are markings of piety.

460
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,060
 It's a way that you would demonstrate your holiness,

461
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,240
 a phylactery was a little leather box

462
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,000
 that they would wear on their forehead

463
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,780
 and they would wear on their arm.

464
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,620
 And it contained copies of the scripture within it.

465
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,180
 The tassels were signifying of their distinction

466
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,300
 as God's people.

467
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,100
 And they love the places of honor at feasts.

468
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,380
 They love the best seats in the synagogues

469
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,620
 and greetings in the marketplaces

470
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,420
 and being called rabbi by others.

471
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,620
 Jesus is looking at the crowds and he's saying,

472
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,860
 "Hey, beware of those that carefully curate

473
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,300
 "their religious image."

474
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,180
 You be aware of those that only associate

475
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,840
 with the influential, that love to sit in the seats of power,

476
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,660
 that want to be identified by very specific titles

477
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,640
 or professions that interact

478
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,340
 with a very exclusive group of people.

479
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,160
 You see, Jesus knows that, as it was true then,

480
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,220
 and so it is true today.

481
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,020
 People have always used God's platform to build their own.

482
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,820
 People have always used God's platform to build their own.

483
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,380
 So just to bring it all the way home for us,

484
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,860
 if the leaders in your life only ever sit

485
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,240
 in the green room backstage and they never traverse

486
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,020
 the halls where the rest of the people are,

487
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,900
 there's reason to be careful.

488
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,220
 If they only ever repost clips of themself

489
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,460
 where you view their grid and it's only pictures of them

490
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,840
 and no one else, you have reason to be careful.

491
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,580
 If they only interact with the socially significant

492
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,280
 other influencers, you have reason to be careful.

493
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,200
 You see, Jesus wants us to know that it's not so much

494
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,020
 the prosperity gospel of times past

495
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,860
 that we should be concerned with,

496
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,040
 instead it is the popularity gospel of times present

497
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,560
 that we should be more concerned with.

498
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,020
 It's the fact that people, they will actually follow God

499
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,340
 to promote themselves.

500
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,380
 And yet that's not what Jesus did.

501
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
 Jesus never did that in his own ministry.

502
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,980
 He never followed God to promote himself.

503
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,340
 He followed God to promote you,

504
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,580
 to move you from death to life.

505
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,300
 That's a pretty significant promotion.

506
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,420
 From enemy of God to child of God,

507
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,980
 that's a pretty significant promotion.

508
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,220
 From belittled to beloved, from lost to found,

509
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,500
 from slave to free.

510
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,300
 Like this was the heart of Jesus for you.

511
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,540
 He wanted to promote you out of your desolation

512
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,340
 and into exaltation.

513
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,780
 He wanted to bring you closer to God

514
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,080
 than you could ever do on your own.

515
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,220
 Now, let me be clear.

516
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,220
 There's nothing wrong with excellent production

517
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,340
 and really, really, really impressive worship

518
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,340
 or buildings, the likes of which you're pretty awestruck by.

519
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,420
 There's nothing wrong with those things.

520
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,200
 Unless they only make much of the man

521
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,100
 and they never make much of the king.

522
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,000
 Then there's an issue.

523
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,120
 So I remember I had a dear friend,

524
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,840
 he was a pastor of mine,

525
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,080
 that was the best at prioritizing his innocence

526
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,480
 rather than his image.

527
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,320
 And he would tell me, "Kylin, whenever you preach,

528
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,700
 "don't see the empty seats.

529
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,480
 "See the full seats instead."

530
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,840
 He would tell me, "Kylin, whenever you walk

531
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,280
 "through the halls, move very slowly.

532
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,340
 "If you're in a rush, people don't think

533
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,520
 "they can approach you, but if you go slow,

534
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,000
 "they might actually come close."

535
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
 And my favorite, he would tell me,

536
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,880
 "Kylin, collect uncommon badges of honor.

537
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,360
 "A little makeup dust on the shoulder

538
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,740
 "from hugging a widow is of much greater value to God

539
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,900
 "than any number of compliments

540
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,500
 "you could earn after a sermon."

541
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,600
 We should desire to live lives of innocence,

542
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,940
 not ones that promote our image.

543
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,540
 You see, what we need to know is what my friend knew,

544
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,380
 that what matters to God is less the magnitude

545
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,300
 of our ministry and more the magnitude of our hearts.

546
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,220
 Because man looks on the outward appearance,

547
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,400
 but God looks at the heart.

548
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,020
 He doesn't care simply that we do the right things,

549
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,760
 he cares that we do them from the right reasons.

550
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,680
 So what's the way that we should walk?

551
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,780
 We've heard the warning, the way you should walk

552
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,900
 is you should aim to be innocent at heart

553
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,020
 and not just impressive in life.

554
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,420
 You should aim to be innocent at heart

555
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,100
 and not just impressive in life.

556
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,940
 That's the first one.

557
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,780
 How we doing, we doing okay?

558
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,180
 Chalking with me, here we go.

559
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,500
 Verse 27, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,

560
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,620
 "you hypocrites, for you are whitewashed tombs,

561
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,680
 "which outwardly appear beautiful,

562
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,580
 "but within are full of dead people's bones

563
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,120
 "and all uncleanness.

564
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,500
 "So you outwardly appear righteous to others,

565
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,900
 "but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."

566
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,740
 So here's the thing, at first glance, this woe,

567
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,100
 it feels very similar to the last one, does it not?

568
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,860
 They feel very similar in nature,

569
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,340
 and yet there is a major difference.

570
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,660
 It's subtle, but it is there.

571
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,640
 And here's the difference.

572
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,700
 The first woe that we read tonight,

573
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,700
 it's about doing the right things from the wrong heart.

574
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,540
 This one is about doing the right things

575
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,740
 from no heart at all.

576
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,140
 You see, Jesus is warning us to beware of those

577
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,200
 who teach dead religion over true grace.

578
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,300
 Beware of those who teach dead religion over true grace.

579
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,460
 Now, at the time that Jesus is speaking,

580
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,700
 contrary to popular belief, tombs were not whitewashed

581
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,000
 for the sole sake of beautifying them.

582
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,380
 You see, that was a side effect

583
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,020
 of why they actually whitewashed them.

584
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,420
 They would whitewash tombs

585
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,340
 because they wanted to make sure that as Israelites

586
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,600
 were traveling from foreign lands back to Jerusalem,

587
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,580
 they could make their way free of the danger

588
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,380
 of stepping on something that would make them unclean,

589
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,660
 namely a tomb or a gravesite.

590
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,060
 And so they would whitewash them.

591
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,100
 They would try to make sure, knowing full well

592
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,940
 that the consequence of being made unclean

593
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,220
 as someone's making their journey is so devastating

594
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,100
 that they could move towards Jerusalem

595
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,980
 and they could do so without fear

596
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,540
 of jeopardizing their journey.

597
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,320
 You see, if you actually stepped on a grave,

598
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,740
 if you actually engaged with a corpse,

599
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,300
 it would make you for seven days unclean.

600
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,660
 Now, for most other ritual impurities,

601
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,760
 they were pretty quick and easy ways

602
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,200
 to find yourself clean again.

603
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,460
 But corpus impurity was the one that,

604
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,520
 it was kind of the granddaddy of defilement, if you will.

605
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,820
 It was the one that was not so easily resolved.

606
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,160
 And so if you and your little family

607
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
 making a journey from wherever you live

608
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,760
 all the way to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover,

609
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,600
 happen to be leading your kids and one of them

610
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,540
 peeled off the path and decided to touch a grave,

611
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,280
 your entire journey would be fruitless.

612
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,580
 It'd be in vain.

613
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,420
 And so the Pharisees are like,

614
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,840
 "Man, we've got to whitewash these things.

615
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,660
 "We've got to paint them up in chalk.

616
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,720
 "We've got to make them look like

617
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,580
 "the ancient Near Eastern of skunks."

618
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,360
 Which may feel weird to you.

619
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,200
 Why a skunk?

620
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,020
 Well, think about it.

621
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,860
 What is a skunk?

622
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,360
 A skunk is a cute little animal

623
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,260
 with very stark colors that alert you

624
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,180
 to come nowhere near them.

625
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,160
 That's why they look black and they look white.

626
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,760
 Like they're alerting predators,

627
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
 "You don't want to mess with me.

628
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,480
 "I may be snuggly, but I will defile you."

629
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,640
 That is what a whitewashed tomb is.

630
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,900
 It looks beautiful,

631
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,240
 but you don't want to get anywhere close to it.

632
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,860
 There's a lot of whitewashing in the church today.

633
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,980
 Beautiful buildings, impressive programs,

634
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,660
 breathtaking visuals, massive ministries,

635
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,640
 but there's very little life change

636
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,980
 in those places at times.

637
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
 Like many in the church,

638
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,360
 they've grown to a place

639
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
 where they know a lot about ministry,

640
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,720
 but they know little about God

641
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,680
 because they've gotten really good

642
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,220
 at playing the Christian game,

643
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,460
 but they're actually not putting any points on the board.

644
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,980
 There's actually no difference in their work.

645
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,800
 And let me just say this.

646
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,720
 I'm highly aware of the fact that I am standing on a stage

647
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,620
 in a place that is big and is beautiful and is branded.

648
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,020
 And I am terrified by that reality.

649
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,840
 I'm so nervous by the fact

650
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,820
 that we could casually show up here on Tuesdays

651
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,600
 and see all of our friends,

652
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,500
 and we could share a message to the crowd,

653
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,600
 and we could sing some songs,

654
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,620
 and we could sell some merch,

655
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,440
 and no real difference could actually be made.

656
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,000
 That we could actually spend time in this room,

657
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
 and we can do all manner of other things,

658
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,860
 but we could miss the thing

659
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,460
 that actually matters the most, meeting with God.

660
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,100
 Like I am not interested in being the weekly entertainment.

661
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,820
 Like I don't want this to be a place of dead religion.

662
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,580
 I don't wanna spend our time

663
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,620
 professionalizing in our ministry.

664
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,540
 That would be a waste.

665
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,780
 Like what I want to be true in this room

666
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,900
 is a radical redemptive movement

667
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,220
 where we meet with God.

668
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,900
 He moves among us,

669
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,380
 and we feel like our lives are forever changed.

670
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,540
 Like we behold his beauty.

671
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,020
 We become more like him.

672
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,660
 We belong to his family,

673
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,900
 and we actually save the world.

674
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,260
 That's what I want here.

675
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,340
 And yet what we know is we can miss it

676
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,400
 if we get so swept up in dead religion.

677
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,920
 I don't wanna live a whitewashed life.

678
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,980
 I don't wanna lead a whitewashed ministry,

679
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,620
 and I don't want you to be whitewashed yourself.

680
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,920
 Yeah, here's the thing.

681
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,540
 We are so prone to doing it.

682
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,580
 We quote our Bibles, we pray our prayers,

683
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,940
 we confess our sins, we show up to group,

684
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,940
 we give our money,

685
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,460
 and we're casual about it the entire time.

686
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,180
 We think about our religious busyness,

687
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,500
 and yet what we feel is apathy and indifference.

688
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,340
 Let me just ask you.

689
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,100
 Do you think God is casual about you in any way?

690
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,260
 Do you think that Jesus looks at you and says,

691
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,980
 yeah, you know what, casual Christianity.

692
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,500
 That's actually something that I wanna reciprocate.

693
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,100
 No, like he doesn't have a casual bone in his body

694
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,900
 when it comes to you.

695
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,860
 He loves you.

696
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,260
 He's wild about you.

697
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,620
 Like he's not apathetic, man.

698
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,740
 Should I spend some time with him today?

699
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,580
 I'm not real sure.

700
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,860
 Yesterday was pretty tough.

701
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,100
 He doesn't approach you like that.

702
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,140
 He's not indifferent over whether or not

703
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,500
 you actually should spend some time

704
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,540
 and visit with one another.

705
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,580
 You know what, I spoke to him from the Word yesterday,

706
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,820
 but he didn't really listen to me later that afternoon.

707
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
 So should I do it again today?

708
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,660
 That's not his heart.

709
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
 He's not indifferent.

710
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,860
 He's not passively interested in you.

711
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,900
 He's not passively interested in you.

712
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,940
 He's passively interested in the circumstances of your life.

713
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,260
 He's not casual about you.

714
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,460
 He is enraptured by you.

715
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,860
 So much so that God would send his own son to save you.

716
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,380
 If you don't believe me, listen to Paul.

717
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,100
 He says in Titus 2,

718
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,380
 for the grace of God has appeared,

719
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,020
 bringing salvation for all people,

720
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,820
 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions

721
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,500
 and to live self-control and upright and godly lives

722
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,660
 in the present age,

723
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,980
 waiting for our blessed hope,

724
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,780
 the appearing of the glory of our great God

725
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,820
 and Savior, Jesus Christ,

726
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,980
 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness

727
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,300
 and to purify himself a people for his own possession

728
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,980
 who are zealous for good works.

729
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,340
 Jesus is not casual about you.

730
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,780
 He is not casual about me.

731
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,340
 He is not casual about these moments.

732
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,180
 He cares deeply.

733
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,320
 He's not interested in dead religion.

734
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,260
 One pastor said it so well.

735
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,500
 What are the differences between cemeteries and hospitals?

736
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,460
 One is peaceful and quiet and calm because it's dead.

737
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,220
 But the other, it is messy and noisy and loud and chaotic.

738
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,340
 Why? Because people are fighting for life.

739
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,240
 That's what grace looks like.

740
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,740
 Grace looks messy.

741
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,860
 It looks wild at times.

742
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,580
 Like grace, it looks like wrestling through your doubts,

743
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,060
 confessing your sins, singing even if you're off key,

744
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,660
 dancing, though that might be a little bit undignified,

745
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,160
 speaking up at the risk of people thinking you're nuts.

746
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,760
 It's reading the Bible, even when you don't understand it.

747
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,360
 It's loving those that do not deserve it.

748
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,120
 And it's pursuing God,

749
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,220
 not seeking to be perfect for other people.

750
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,780
 That's what true Christianity sounds like.

751
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,300
 True Christianity, it does not sound flawless.

752
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,420
 It sounds faithful.

753
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,280
 It sounds faithful.

754
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,740
 God isn't interested in you being successful.

755
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,800
 He wants you to be faithful.

756
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,420
 He wants you to buy into the grace that he gives.

757
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,380
 He's warned you, man, don't worry about dead religion.

758
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,140
 Instead, the way you should walk

759
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,700
 is you should live by the grace I give,

760
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,800
 not die by the good you can do.

761
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,500
 Last one, verses 29 through 32.

762
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,880
 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,

763
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,860
 for you build the tombs of the prophets

764
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,400
 and decorate the monuments of the righteous,

765
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,640
 saying if we had lived in the days of our fathers,

766
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,060
 we would not have taken part with them

767
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,960
 in shedding the blood of the prophets.

768
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,660
 But you witness against yourselves

769
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,380
 that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.

770
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,900
 Fill up then the measure of your fathers.

771
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,200
 The last thing that Jesus warns us

772
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,140
 is we should beware of those who cast judgment

773
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,320
 instead of give mercy.

774
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,100
 We should beware of those who cast judgment

775
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
 instead of give mercy.

776
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,180
 There's a lot of irony in this last woe

777
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,440
 because Jesus calls out the Pharisees

778
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,020
 for their dishonesty in this moment.

779
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,860
 Like they look at Jesus and they say,

780
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,220
 hey, we know what our fathers did.

781
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,980
 They killed the prophets, but we're not like them.

782
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,340
 Like, no, no, no, we're better, we're kinder, we're wiser.

783
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,860
 We wouldn't do what they did.

784
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
 And yet Jesus is looking at them and saying,

785
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,100
 hey, you will not only do what they did,

786
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,800
 you will do it in a matter of a week's time

787
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,660
 because you will kill God's greatest prophet.

788
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,940
 You will kill me.

789
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,780
 He calls him out.

790
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,180
 He lets him know.

791
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,880
 You think you give mercy, but in fact, you give judgment.

792
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,380
 When I was studying this, I remember thinking to myself,

793
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,460
 this is the hardest woe to identify within our regular world

794
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,780
 because we're not really interested in killing the prophets.

795
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,300
 Like that's not something we actually do today.

796
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,820
 But then I realized we do condemn one another.

797
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,300
 In a similar way, we kill each other all the same.

798
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,980
 We're quick to enthrone ourselves

799
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,180
 upon the opinions that we have formed

800
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:06,500
 rather than receive the mercy and extend it instead to people

801
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,160
 the way Jesus has given it to us.

802
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,360
 You find this issue across the spectrum of spirituality.

803
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,380
 You can find it amongst the most contemplative of camps.

804
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,140
 Leaders who, man, on the surface,

805
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,300
 they advocate compelling theological positions

806
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,940
 and a fidelity to God's word and a scriptural precision

807
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,980
 that is really, really interesting.

808
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,420
 And yet all the while, they passively scrutinize

809
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,820
 other people, they openly cast judgments

810
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,260
 upon those that disagree with their doctrinal distinctives.

811
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,660
 But it's not just in the most contemplative of camps.

812
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,980
 It's also in the most charismatic of camps.

813
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,740
 Like you can find people who, man,

814
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,060
 they motivate your morality.

815
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,820
 Like they stir up your spirit.

816
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,060
 They fan into flame.

817
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,060
 Like that spot fire of faith in your life.

818
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,980
 Like they're so good at it and yet they are willing to do so

819
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,820
 at great compromise to the scripture.

820
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,700
 Like they'll do what they can to emotionally motivate

821
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:08,300
 yet ultimately not bring about the kind of conviction

822
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,140
 God's spirit can do through his word and his word alone.

823
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,420
 They are seeking to serve their own agenda

824
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,180
 and they're willing to manipulate people to get it done.

825
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,840
 You can find it also in yourselves.

826
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,360
 You see, we're really quick to honor God with our lips.

827
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,840
 But in the same breath,

828
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:35,560
 we also tend to criticize, convict, and condemn one another.

829
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,920
 James, he says this himself.

830
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,920
 He says, "With the tongue, we praise our Lord and Father

831
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,920
 "and with it we curse human beings."

832
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,460
 We curse one another.

833
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,360
 "Those that have been made in God's likeness

834
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,420
 "out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.

835
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,740
 "My brothers, my sisters, this shouldn't be so.

836
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,660
 "I know this was a problem for me

837
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,200
 "for several years of my life."

838
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,560
 So I grew up in the church.

839
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,640
 And yet it wasn't until I got to college

840
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,520
 that I really began to read the Bible.

841
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,500
 Like I got some theological exposure.

842
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,520
 And with that, as is often true,

843
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,120
 I got some theological pride.

844
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,580
 I thought that I knew better.

845
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,060
 I was wiser.

846
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,400
 I had more discernment than the rest of those

847
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
 that I had grown up alongside.

848
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,980
 And so what I decided to do is I decided to part ways

849
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,880
 with that group.

850
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,340
 They were pretty conservative.

851
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,480
 They held fast to tradition.

852
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,440
 And yet what I realized is I studied the Bibles.

853
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,020
 Man, it feels like they're pretty inconclusively

854
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,980
 studying the scripture.

855
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,380
 And so I judged them and I joined instead

856
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,940
 a charismatic group.

857
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,300
 I spent time around that charismatic group

858
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
 and I was so motivated by the way they lived their lives.

859
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,980
 And yet over the course of time,

860
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,940
 I began to grow skeptical

861
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,860
 because they were more interested in the gifts

862
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,860
 of the spirit and not merely walking with Jesus.

863
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,080
 And so I judged them and I decided to join

864
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,780
 a gospel saturated group.

865
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,660
 A group that really revered the Bible,

866
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,460
 that spent time studying the scripture.

867
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,100
 And yet what I realized as I sat in Bible study

868
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
 and I read through the text is that this group of people,

869
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,900
 though they were really well-meaning,

870
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,300
 they were pretty theologically shallow.

871
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,140
 They hadn't read Luther and Calvin and Spurgeon

872
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,500
 and Edwards and Owen the way that I had.

873
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,740
 And so it was good for me to actually part ways with them,

874
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,580
 cast judgment, join instead a very intellectual group.

875
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,100
 And as I spent time amongst this intellectual group,

876
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,580
 what I realized is, man, you guys are stimulating.

877
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,740
 You guys are interesting,

878
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,580
 but you're actually pretty insular.

879
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,940
 You're not very missiological.

880
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,380
 You're not very interested in what's happening

881
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,220
 out in the world.

882
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,300
 And so wouldn't you believe it?

883
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,980
 I judged them and you get it at this point, right?

884
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,740
 Like this was my story for a lot of my life.

885
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,980
 This was my journey of faith

886
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,520
 during my early, early, early young adult years.

887
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,900
 And though it was largely unknown to me at the time,

888
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,340
 I was quick to criticize other people.

889
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,380
 I was quick to condemn them.

890
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,740
 And I was quick to cast them aside

891
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,240
 in the pursuit of God's truth.

892
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,700
 Some of you have experienced that same thing.

893
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,700
 Some of you were that same person.

894
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,340
 Others of you have sat on the other side

895
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,700
 of the table from that guy.

896
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,540
 And you were judged for something you did.

897
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:27,300
 You were silenced because that sin is just too much.

898
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,020
 You were belittled because you were a bit different.

899
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,580
 You didn't categorically fit

900
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,580
 into the regular Christian circles.

901
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:41,340
 And you had to become individually censored

902
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,620
 or else people would think you're divisive

903
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,820
 to the rest of the body.

904
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,700
 And you're here tonight.

905
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,340
 And all you can think is I'm done.

906
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,840
 I've had my fill.

907
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,820
 I've seen what the church offers.

908
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,020
 And I'm still wanting.

909
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,620
 I'm unimpressed.

910
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,100
 I'm disappointed.

911
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,440
 I'm even actually betrayed.

912
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,280
 If that's you, then listen to me.

913
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,940
 Jesus has not condemned you for your mistakes.

914
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,380
 So do not condemn him for the mistakes of his people.

915
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:39,940
 Like some of you have walked into places like this

916
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
 and your experience was like my experience

917
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,300
 when I walked into my apartment that day.

918
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,380
 All you saw were stains.

919
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,500
 All you smelt was foul.

920
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,980
 All you saw was broken.

921
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,220
 And all you felt was distrust.

922
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,060
 Jesus is not trying to sweep in and save you out of that.

923
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,200
 He wants to come in and he wants to clean the stain.

924
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,420
 He wants to purify the foulness.

925
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,220
 Like he wants to wash away the grime.

926
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,940
 He wants to mend your hurt.

927
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,300
 He wants to rebuild your trust

928
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,540
 because while Jesus himself was church hurt,

929
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,820
 he didn't respond by hurting the church.

930
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,600
 He responded by saving her.

931
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,700
 And the reason we know it is because Jesus,

932
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,480
 he never worried about his image in life.

933
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,500
 Instead, he worried about our innocence.

934
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,020
 So much so that he himself was religiously ridiculed.

935
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,380
 You feel religiously ridiculed?

936
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,480
 Jesus was religiously ridiculed for the sake of you.

937
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,940
 Jesus, he never taught dead religion.

938
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,100
 No, he taught about a living grace

939
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,940
 that reaches out to the spiritually wounded

940
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,420
 through his wounds himself.

941
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,420
 And Jesus, he never came to condemn.

942
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,240
 Instead, he was condemned in our place.

943
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,020
 Jesus wants to save his church.

944
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,140
 He wants to save you too if you'll let him.

945
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,200
 I don't know how deep the wounds may go,

946
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,260
 but you need only look to his wounds and realize he can.

947
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,780
 He can save you, he can do it,

948
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,740
 and he can bring you back home.

949
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,500
 Let me pray for us.

950
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,940
 God, we love you.

951
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,060
 Thankful for tonight, grateful for a chance

952
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,660
 just to sit under your word and to feel God the weight of it.

953
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,440
 Like I don't want us to shy away from the hard scriptures.

954
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,660
 I don't want us to just preach pleasant platitudes.

955
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,300
 God, I want us to look at those texts, those scriptures,

956
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,240
 which really weigh God, not just on our circumstance,

957
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,000
 but even our soul.

958
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,940
 We feel that tonight.

959
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,800
 God, there's some people in here

960
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,800
 that have been just deeply hurt by your church,

961
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,340
 by religious leaders, by the spiritually significant,

962
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,020
 and God, they are all but ready to give up.

963
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,820
 I pray they would know while you can relate,

964
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 to their pain, you cannot relate to that choice.

965
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,400
 For you, Jesus, did not come to condemn your church,

966
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,040
 you came to save her.

967
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,920
 So what do you say at the end of this passage?

968
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,840
 You say, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,"

969
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,240
 that you would know the things which make for peace today.

970
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:56,180
 I pray, Jesus, that we would lament the pain we've felt

971
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,480
 and the poor representation it is of you,

972
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,320
 but we would not give up, we would lean in.

973
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,840
 And then, Jesus, I know there are people in this room

974
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,560
 that are religious leaders, that do the work of ministry,

975
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,640
 that faithfully follow and seek to serve your flock.

976
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,800
 I pray that you would be near to them,

977
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,320
 that you would encourage them, that you would secure them,

978
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,560
 that they wouldn't look to the watching world

979
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,560
 to find their identity, but they would find it within you.

980
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,880
 You're a good King, and it's to you now

981
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,280
 that we sing, in Christ's name, amen.

982
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,580
 Hey, porch, let's stand together, if you will.

983
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,800
 Hey, we've got a team down to the left, down to the right,

984
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,720
 they would love to visit with you,

985
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,840
 if you need to process, if you need to pray,

986
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,860
 maybe you've never talked about this stuff with anybody.

987
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,120
 We'd love to begin the conversation with you tonight.

988
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,060
 Others of you used to sing, you'd be faithful,

989
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,920
 need not be flawless, but God wants to meet with you tonight.

990
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,200
 Let's not entertain empty religion,

991
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,920
 let's engage with what really matters,

992
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,020
 let's sing to Him now.

993
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,600
 (gentle music)
