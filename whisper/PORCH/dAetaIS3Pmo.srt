1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 I mean, he's practically dating a model.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 She told me they went to Cabo and he paid for the whole thing.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower. In Paris.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 What more could you ask for?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Love it. Plays in his fantasy football league and everything.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Let's go. What's up, friends in the room? What's up, friends in Fort Worth?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And in Houston? And in the Woodlands?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Yeah, get excited. A new Woodlands camp is kicked off next week.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 So hello, Woodlands friends. Miss Houston.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's my hood, man. Stomping grounds.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We are continuing this relationship series.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm going to start with a story that will kind of give us some traction for where we're going.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Anybody, who's in college in the room right now?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Yeah, okay, man. All right, represent. Let's go.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 All right, so here's what is about to happen to you in probably three or four years.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 If you're a senior, it's happening next year.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You're going to lose something called spring break.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And so, yeah, I know it's tragic.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 For some reason, they just don't give adults that anymore.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And maybe, you know, maybe Bernie Sanders will bring it back if he runs in 2020.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Anyways, that's not a political statement, people. Take it easy.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 All right, moving on.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And so when I was in college, I'm going to start by a spring break story.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That was my last spring break that I got to experience. It was senior year of college.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I knew with my roommates this was going to be our last spring break.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 That we weren't going to have one of these going forward because you don't get them once you get out of college.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So we were going to do it big. We had a plan.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We were going to go to the beach, six of us, actually seven of us.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We're going to go to the beach. We had this whole thing planned out, our last spring break together.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Seven days, we were going to drive to Florida all together in one car.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Spend seven days. It was going to be awesome.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Not only that, we had arranged because we had a friend who wasn't coming on the trip.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But he was a friend of ours who, his family owned a condo in Florida.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So we were going to stay there for free.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So this thing was only getting better, planned it all out.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 This is going to be amazing.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So the day finally comes. We all load up in this 1998 Tahoe.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We're getting in there, seven guys. Doesn't smell great by the end of the trip, but oh well.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We drive through the night. We're crushing Red Bull to stay up.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Because we're just going to drive from 8 o'clock all the way and get there that morning.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So we can really get to experience the whole thing.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So we're driving, driving, driving. Just keep moving forward.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We're switching out cars. We're all exhausted. It's 3 a.m. in the morning.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Finally, a few hours later, we show up and we arrive at the airport.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Because we had to pick up the seventh person who had flown in from New York.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Random side note.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So we get him at the airport. Just keep moving forward.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're going to go to the condo. We'll be there soon.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Soon we'll be on the beach. We're all exhausted, man.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I can't wait to get to the beach. It's going to be great.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Finally, we show up at the condo. Pull up to it.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It looks awesome. Just like all the pictures that we had seen about it.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I can see the pool. I can see the beach.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It's this nice, fancy condo.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Hey guys, wait here. I'm going to go inside and get the key.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I had kind of arranged and organized the thing.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 So I go inside, show up. Hey, we're here to get our room and get our keys.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We're staying in the McLaughlin home, which was none of our last names.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It was just the family that owned the condo.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So I begin to tell the lady, hey, we're staying in this room.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 She looks it up. Yes, you are. Okay, perfect.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Here's some paperwork to fill out.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Hands me the paperwork. I'm beginning to sign it.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 She says, the last thing I need you to sign is just something that confirms

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 that you are a member of the McLaughlin family.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Or that a McLaughlin is with you.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I'm immediately thinking, oh no.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 We just drove 12 hours in the car.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 We don't have a McLaughlin anywhere around us.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I have a couple of choices. I can either lie.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I can just embrace a new last name, I guess.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 All of a sudden, it's flashed through my mind.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I'm like, oh my gosh. Really? We can't stay here unless someone in the family is with us.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Why didn't they tell us that before they came?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Where are we going to go? You're going to make me get back into that car.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 All the hotels in town are booked.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So we're going to end up at a La Quinta in Alabama or something.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 All of this is flashed through my head.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Oh my gosh. I'm out of options. We just came so far.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 We've already invested so much time and energy into this.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 This guy who flew from New York. It can't be that this is happening.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So literally, I can't believe this happened.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Literally, she's like, yeah, I just need to confirm.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I totally dodged the question.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I'm like, oh my, those flowers are so pretty.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Do I sign here? Is this where I sign?

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Perfect. I sign the thing, take the key from her, begin to walk out.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Going, oh man, finally I made it. I guess I got the key.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I get to the door and all of a sudden this wave of conviction hits me.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I'm like, oh my gosh. I just lied to Phyllis behind the desk.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Whatever. What am I doing?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I can't keep moving forward with this.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Despite the fact of how long we had been on this journey,

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I can't keep moving forward with this.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And so I turn around and I head back towards the desk.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And I'm going to pause the story and I'm going to come back to it.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But the reason I start there is because I know, cliffhanger.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 In case you were thinking about leaving early.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 The reason that I start there is because just like in that scenario where,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 hey, we had gone on this journey, we'd invested so much time,

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 we'd invested so much energy into this thing.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Yes, we are just at the finish line, even if it doesn't exactly go how we kind of want to.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Let's just lean our shoulder in and make it work together.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 We've already put so much energy. We may not have any other options out there.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 That scenario reflects very well what many of us experience when it comes to dating relationships.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 What many of us may be even in the room right now,

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 we're in a relationship may be experiencing where all of a sudden we find ourselves in this place.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 We're wondering like, man, should I keep moving forward?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It doesn't seem right, but should I keep just moving forward in it?

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I've already invested so much time. I've already invested so much energy.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 What if I end up not moving forward? What is everybody else going to think?

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I could be out of options if this happens.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Like if I end it, what if they were the only one I have?

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And then all of a sudden I'm 60 and just the cat lady for the rest of my life.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And like all of a sudden I've invested all this. Is this my last option?

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 That same scenario is really reflective of how so many of us, what so many of us experience in dating.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And so tonight we're going to talk about that idea of, hey, when to not move forward.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 When as a Christian or as a follower of Christ, it is not optional for us whether or not we decide,

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 hey, we're going to continue moving forward on this journey or are we going to turn back?

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And so tonight we're going to lay out those specifically if you're a Christian in the room.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 If you're not a Christian in the room, man, there's not a ton on dating that really was going to be helpful for me.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 The thing that you need most is Jesus. And so we're glad you're here. Hang with us if we can serve you in any way.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But if you're a Christian in the room, we're going to cover a list that is not optional for us.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 These are the times that as followers of Jesus, you and I do not have the choice of moving forward.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 We have to turn back. We have to end it.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so we're going to look at those tonight. Some of them may be review. Some of them may be new to you.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And so we're going to cover really topically five different ideas, five times when to break the relationship,

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 five different times when to break the relationship.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So normally we'll pick a single passage and we will march through that.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 As you probably know, if you've been hanging with us, the subject of dating is not a topic that is talked about much in the Bible.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's not talked about at all for the same reason we go like, oh, that's interesting.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Why did they not have dating in the Bible? Because there wasn't dating when the Bible was written.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And the same reason they don't have online or social media or Facebook.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It never talks about Facebook because there was no Facebook then. There was no dating then.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 The way that marriage took place was through an arrange.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Now we live in a society where dating and getting to know one another, getting to know someone of the opposite sex is kind of a part of just life today.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And so what we do as Christians in light of this new creation called dating is we take biblical principles and we use those.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And those become the filter through which we navigate because it may not talk about dating,

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 but it has a lot to say about evaluation of a potential spouse, about who to marry and how to marry.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So we're going to look at the five different occasions the Bible would say hit the ejection seat now in the relationship.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 So the first one of when is an occasion for a Christian to break up is if one of you in the relationship is not following Jesus.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 If one of you in the relationship is not following in Jesus, this would include someone whose life is just,

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 "Hey, I grew up as a Christian," or someone who says, "No, I'm not a Christian. I have a different faith."

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Here's what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6, one of the letters that he wrote to the church in Corinth.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 He says this, "Do not be yoked or linked, or you may have partnered together with," in your Bible,

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 "together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 What fellowship can light have with darkness?"

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 That Paul says you are to not partner together. He uses this illustration like, "What's a yoke?

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 What does that have to do?" The only thing yoke we talk about anymore is dealing with breakfast.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 This is a very different type of yoke. A yoke would be placed on cattle or an oxen when they would work out in the field.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You would take two oxen, and you would place this yoke over their necks.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They would pull together in the same direction.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 If you had different sized animals, an oxen and a horse or a donkey, it wouldn't work,

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 because they couldn't pull at the same degree.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Or, they would pull in different directions.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Paul says, "If you are a Christian, the thing that is most significant, most important in your life,

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 or should be most important in your life, is your faith, your relationship with Christ."

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 When it comes to choosing the most important human relationship that you're going to have,

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 which is marriage, after you discover, "Hey, this is who my master is, Jesus.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 This is what my mission is, that's to make disciples."

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 After you decide your master and your mission, the next thing to decide is who you're going to marry.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Paul says that you and I, as Christians, are called to marry other Christians.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 We don't date. We don't marry non-Christians.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 We don't do missionary dating. I feel like this goes without saying.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 But, statistically, even today in society, they would back up what Paul is saying,

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 where he says, "You don't want someone who doesn't share your perspective on the world around you,

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 on eternity, on how to handle money, on just how to view the world.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Your faith impacts everything.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Why would you marry or date someone who doesn't share the same thing, the same faith that impacts everything?"

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It's kind of a no-brainer.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But, even today, sociologists will say, "Hey, interfaith marriage is not a great idea.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You have a 75% chance of getting a divorce if you marry someone of a different faith background."

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So, it just confirms what the Bible says.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But, not only are we, as Christians, called to date other Christ-followers, or other Christians,

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 but people who are following Jesus.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 In other words, and man, I think this is the huge one for people in Fort Worth, people in Houston,

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 people in the room right now, people in the woodlands,

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 for you to know that your responsibility is not just to look for someone who's like,

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 "Oh, yeah, I'm a Christian. Hey, I was raised in church."

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Because we live in Texas, we live in Dallas,

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and so, if you just randomly pick someone, there's a statistical chance, a good chance,

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 they're going to say, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Meaning, "I'm not Muslim, I'm not atheist, and I'm an American.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 These colors don't run. I'm a Christian, good news."

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And that's what they're going to say.

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And so, as Christians, or as Christ-followers, our responsibility is not to find someone who says,

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "I'm a Christian. I was raised Catholic or Episcopalian."

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But, someone who says, "The priority in my life is Jesus.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I love Jesus more than I will ever love you."

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That's the person that you want to marry.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 That's the person you want to date.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The person whose focus, the epitome of their life, is, "I'm going to follow him."

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And out of the overflow of that, hey, you're going to make an amazing husband or amazing wife

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 if that person says, "I love this first and foremost. My first love will be Christ."

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 That's the person that you want to date.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That's the person that will be the best love that you could experience inside of marriage.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 But as followers of Jesus, it's so huge.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And even statistically, man, this was so discouraging or encouraging, I guess, in weird ways.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Here's what sociology has discovered.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 That the divorce rate among Christians who are actively involved, like, "I'm all in. I am following Jesus."

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We've said it before, that, hey, there's never been a divorce between two fully devoted followers of Christ.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 But even if you just say, well, sociology would say, "Hey, people who are actively involved in their faith,

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 their faith is a priority.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Like, they are going to church, they're serving in church.

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 They experience a 46% less rate of divorce than the rest of society."

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 People who are nominal Christians.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 What do I mean by nominal?

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It means cultural Christians.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It means a good amount of the people that you meet out there who are like, "Yeah, I'm a Christian.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I go to church on Christmas and Easter, and I'm all for Jesus. That's great.

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And I'm an American."

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 That type of person, sociology says, they have a 20% greater likelihood than two atheists of getting a divorce.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 That this watered-down version of Christianity that's everywhere in our country.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 The worst thing that you can do is to go marry someone who's lukewarm.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Marry someone who doesn't at all.

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 If you're like, "Oh, man, they say they're Christian."

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 That is the worst thing you can do.

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 You need to be all in with Jesus, and they need to be all in with Jesus.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Or else, you are significantly impacting the future that you're going to have together.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Even sociology is going to say that.

224
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Does that make sense?

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Significantly, you have a higher likelihood of getting a divorce if you're just nominal.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Hey, the person who says, "Oh, yeah, I'm a Christian, but everything in moderation.

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 I'm not too religious."

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 That person, they would say, "Do not marry that person."

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And that's not a Christian.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Because a normative Christian life is when he says, "I'm all in with my Savior.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I'm going to seek Him first.

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And out of that, I'll love because of my first love, which is Him."

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So the first occasion in which we do not marry or we don't move forward in the relationship,

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 we stop moving forward, we end it, is when they're not a Christian.

235
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 The second occasion is when followers of Christ around us, our second point tonight out of the five,

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 is when followers of Christ around us do not celebrate the relationship.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 When followers of Christ around us do not celebrate the relationship.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 We played with, "Hey, should this be like when our community group doesn't?

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Or should it be like when Christian family members?"

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And it's really just when the followers of Jesus, people who say, "Hey, I'm a follower of Christ,"

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 they're following Him.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 When those people around us begin to say, "I don't think he's right for you.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I don't think she's right for you.

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Here are the concerns that I see in your relationship."

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 When those people around us are not over the top celebrating, like, "Man, yes, this is a good thing.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Keep moving forward. This is awesome. I'm a fan of him. I'm a fan of her. I'm a fan of this."

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 When that's not going on, you need to seriously question what's going on.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Now, Song of Solomon is a book in the Old Testament, and it's essentially a love story.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you've never read the book of Song of Solomon, you can go read it this week.

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And it's an incredibly romantic love story.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's a story about this couple and their marriage.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It's a story, if you think the Bible's boring, that was so sexualized that still today,

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Orthodox Jews can't read it until they're 30 years old if you're a boy.

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Think about that, or a man.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 30 years old.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's like, "Hey, we're going to hide this over here with HBO.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You can't watch this."

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's what's going on.

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 True. True story today.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And it has been inside of the Jewish community.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 All that to say, the story of Song of Solomon is this incredible story.

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Inside of there, it tells about the relationship that this couple, as they begin to move towards marriage,

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 that their friends around them had with them.

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And it says that their friends, Song of Solomon chapter 1, verse 4, you can go read it later.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It says it throughout the book.

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It essentially says their friends, when they would gather around, they would go, "Yes! Yes!

267
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Bob and Mary, we love it. This is amazing."

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 It says they look on it and they celebrate their love more than wine.

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And when it came to the party, is why it says wine, when it came to the wedding celebration,

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 it was like, "We celebrate. We love that there's an open bar over here,

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 but we celebrate you guys way more than any party or any wedding reception that we'll ever get to be a part of."

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 With the friends, the followers, the people of God around them looked on and said, "This is a good thing."

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And if you're in a dating relationship and the people in your life who love Jesus

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 and are trying to follow Him are constantly raising concerns, you should be concerned.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Sadly, one of the more common reactions to when people begin to raise concerns

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 is that we just begin to rule them out of our life.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Like over and over you see a person who's like, "Yeah, you think this is a bad idea,

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 so I think you're a bad idea, so we're not going to be friends anymore."

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And they just push away from the Christian Christ-following people around them who are raising concerns.

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 If your family members are sincere and they love Jesus and they're raising concerns,

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 listen, process with community.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 One of the most foolish things you can do is be that couple who continues to isolate

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 and just be like, "Hey, it's just us. We'll figure it out together."

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 That couple, the Scripture would say, is a fool.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 If you're dating alone, you are acting foolishly at best and maybe too fools, most accurately said.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Here's what Proverbs 18, verse 1 says, "The wisest man who ever lived said,

287
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 'Hey, look, whoever isolates himself when he dates, when he does money, when he does anything,

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 when he lives life, whoever isolates himself seeks his own desires.

289
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He seeks what he wants, he seeks what he thinks is best, and in doing so,

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 he breaks out or fights against all sound judgment.'"

291
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Like all common sense, it would say.

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Whoever isolates himself and is like, "No, girls, it's just me and Bae. We got this thing."

293
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Whoever does that, the Proverbs would say, "That man is a fool.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 He will not have the gift of other people speaking in and asking good questions,

295
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 helping hold accountable, helping walk alongside to lead them in the direction that they want

296
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and that God wants for their relationship."

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And the Proverbs would say, "That man is a fool."

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 If you are here in the room tonight and you do not have a community

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 or other Christ followers around you, the best application that you can apply,

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 whether it's breaking up or not, is getting into a community group.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We're gonna have an open community group tonight after the message.

302
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 If you're a guy and a girl, mark that down.

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 That's where you need to head tonight.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It's the single best thing you can do, even better than a message that you're gonna hear on any week.

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So make sure that you're a part of that.

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 In the community, we get to experience Christ followers looking on and celebrating.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And if you don't have that, you should have cause for concern.

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Okay, third opportunity, a third occasion.

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So we've got, hey, if either one of you is not following Jesus,

310
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 if they're not following Jesus with their life, end the relationship.

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Don't keep moving forward.

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 If the Christ followers around you are constantly raising concerns,

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 end the relationship.

314
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Don't keep moving forward.

315
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 The fourth occasion is if you together are not relentlessly pursuing purity.

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 If you're not relentlessly pursuing purity,

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 we talked a little bit about this last week where Garrett just taught.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Garrett's our Fort Worth director and leader and did an amazing job covering the subject of purity.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And so if you missed it, make sure to go listen to that.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 What does it look like more specifically to pursue purity?

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But here's why purity's so important.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And we covered some of this last week.

323
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But here's what the Bible says about sex.

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 It's intoxicating.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Like, what does something that's intoxicating do?

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 It begins to blur your vision and you get intoxicated.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The Bible, Proverbs 5, you can go read it later.

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 If you have a Bible, you can read Proverbs written by Solomon

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 where he writes about sex and he says,

330
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 "Sex is like intoxicating."

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Like, it's so good and this is why it's for marriage.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And he writes about it in saying,

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 "Hey, you should be drunk in love with your wife."

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Read it later if you think the Bible's boring.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So in Proverbs chapter 5, Solomon said,

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 "Look, you should be drunk in love. It's amazing.

337
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Sex is intoxicating and it should be in marriage."

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But that's why it's so dangerous outside of marriage.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's intoxicating.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Like, it's so good you can't think straight.

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It all of a sudden begins to take down inhibitions.

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 You're like, "Oh, man, you don't speak English,

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 "but I love you."

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And all of a sudden, all the things,

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 you're like, "Man, this is so great."

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 That's what sex does.

347
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 It leads you, it makes your mind, it's so good,

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 it makes you not able to think straight.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Song of Solomon tells us God gave that gift

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 to be inside of the context and the safety of marriage.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But the danger is when you take it outside of marriage

352
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 and you introduce it into a dating,

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 all of a sudden, you've got drunk goggles on

354
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 everywhere that you're going.

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I mean, what decision in life is as important as marriage,

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 and yet what would we do, or what decisions,

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 what other big life decisions would we be like,

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 "Yes, here's how I've decided to make big life decisions.

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 "I get hammered."

360
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And then I'm like, "Should I buy this house

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 "or should I rent?"

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That's what really has helped me make good decisions.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'm like, "Hey, where should I go to college?

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 "Where should I start?"

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I just get wasted.

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And then I feel like I could really start to,

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 that's the danger of sex in dating,

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 is it's intoxicating.

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And if you're stepping into that,

370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 it is going to lead you to stay in the relationship

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 longer than you should.

372
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It's gonna lead you to do things

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 that you never thought you would.

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It'll lead you to date someone

375
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 that God's word says you shouldn't be.

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And so if sex is a part,

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 if you're not relentlessly pursuing purity,

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 you're right now just going,

379
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 "Hey, we're just having sex."

380
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 You are being deceived by yourself,

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 and it's like drunk driving.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 You're drunk buying a house.

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You are making a decision intoxicated.

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And you're gonna see it's gonna come back to bring pain.

385
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You're not thinking clearly.

386
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 That's the power.

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 That's why pursuing purity is so important.

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That we're relentless about pursuing purity relentlessly

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 is the third reason.

390
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 If you're not both, then it's time to break up.

391
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 The scripture also would say things

392
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 that include the idea of cohabitation,

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 that you can't be pursuing purity relentlessly

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 if you're not cohabitating.

395
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Here's what it says in Hebrews 13 about the marriage bed.

396
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It says, "Marriage should be honored by everyone."

397
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Everyone should honor marriage.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's a sacred thing.

399
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And the marriage bed, in other words,

400
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 what happens in the bedroom,

401
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 is not just between you and Sally.

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 It's God is involved, and he says,

403
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 "What happens there is to be kept sacred and pure."

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 The marriage bed should be kept pure.

405
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 That the author of Hebrews says,

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 "Keep the bedroom for the bride and groom,"

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 if you like rhymes.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Keep the bedroom for the bride and groom.

409
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 That's what belongs.

410
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And so if you are living together,

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I don't know how you can be relentlessly pursuing purity.

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And if you're living together, move out.

413
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And most likely, don't move forward.

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And move on.

415
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Begin to heal.

416
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Break up and get discipled.

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And man, the other thing that people will say

418
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 when they're cohabitating,

419
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 or living together, cohabitation,

420
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 is they're like, "No, but you know, it's great.

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 "We're not sleeping together anymore.

422
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 "He sleeps on top of the sheet,

423
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 "and then we pull the cover over,

424
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 "and I'm under the sheet, and so it's all great."

425
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Man, I hope you hear me on this.

426
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 If you live together in the room,

427
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 and I'm not trying to pick on you,

428
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I'm just saying, please, please, please,

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 don't live together.

430
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 If you're living together, and you're like,

431
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 "Yes, we don't have sex.

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 "We live together, but we're not having sex."

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Here's why that's such a bad idea

434
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 for your future marriage.

435
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 You are training yourself every day,

436
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 "We are gonna live together, and not have sex.

437
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 "That's what we're gonna do.

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 "Bring it on, okay."

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 That's a horrible idea for your marriage.

440
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Think about that.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 You are literally training yourself.

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 We have mastered the art of living together,

443
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 and having no sexual chemistry,

444
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 so it's like platonic.

445
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 "They might as well be my sister.

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 "I'm like great at this."

447
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 That's a horrible idea.

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 I mean, you're like, "Oh, that's gross."

449
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 That's what you're doing if you're saying,

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 "We're gonna live together, and not have sex."

451
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That's a horrible idea.

452
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You weren't made and wired to be that way.

453
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Move out, and if you can't move out,

454
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and you're like, "Man, I can't afford it."

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 We will help you find affordable homes,

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 or affordable living.

457
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 We will cover you.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 If you're like, "Man, we just can't afford it."

459
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Come down here.

460
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 We'd love to talk to you.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 We'd love to find other ways and avenues

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 to open up doors for you to move out and move on,

463
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 'cause usually it's a smoke screen.

464
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Let's be honest.

465
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You're like, "Yeah, I can't afford it.

466
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 "I've got this Range Rover lease,

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "and I've got this iPhone,

468
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 "and I just kinda like to shop at Neiman's."

469
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And so, you can afford it,

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and you're hiding behind it,

471
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and it's going to cause you harm.

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 If you're living together, you're not pursuing purity,

473
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 and you should be concerned.

474
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Significantly increased are your chances of divorce.

475
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 This relationship you're in, if you're living together,

476
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 it's not gonna last, and you should be afraid.

477
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Sociologists would say that.

478
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And even if they didn't,

479
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 God's Word has made it clear.

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 That is not God's design.

481
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 You should end this relationship.

482
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 If you are a Christian, it's not an option for you.

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 I read a book this week,

484
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and it was talking about a pastor,

485
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 how he will counsel people who are living together,

486
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and it's so good.

487
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He'll sit down with couples who are cohabitating,

488
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 who are like, "No, we're not ready for marriage yet,

489
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 "but we're taking a step in that direction."

490
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 He's like, "Great.

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 "Hey, because you're there,

492
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 "you're not ready for marriage vows,

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 "but you've really already taken vows,

494
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 "whether or not you realize it,

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 "so I'm just gonna make it formal.

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 "Will you read these vows?"

497
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And he has his couple read these vows of cohabitation.

498
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I thought it was so perfectly summed up,

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 what they've essentially communicated

500
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 and committed to one another,

501
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 whether or not they realize it.

502
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 What you, if you're in the room,

503
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 are communicating and committing if you're cohabitating.

504
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Here's the vows of cohabitation, if you will.

505
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I take you to be my cohabitant,

506
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 to have sex with you,

507
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 and hold you responsible for half the bills,

508
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 to love and to take advantage of you

509
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 for as long as our arrangement works out.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I will be more or less faithful to you

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 as long as my needs are met,

512
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 and if nothing better comes along.

513
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 If I should break up with you,

514
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 it doesn't mean that this wasn't special to me,

515
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 because I love you almost as much as I love myself.

516
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I commit to live with you for now,

517
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 so help me, me.

518
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 (audience laughing)

519
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 In the name of sex, options, and selfishness, amen.

520
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 (audience laughing)

521
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 (audience applauding)

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It's comical, and sure, we can clap.

523
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And if you're in the room and you're living together,

524
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 I'm not trying to pick on you,

525
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 but you're communicating something to one another,

526
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and at least you need to hit pause and move out.

527
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And if you're thinking,

528
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 yeah, but we're gonna get married soon,

529
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'm not even sure you should date soon,

530
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 because if the decisions that you're making reflect

531
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 the way that you think about the world,

532
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 which reflects, really, your faith

533
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and the status of your relationship with Christ right now.

534
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And my guess is you're not at a place

535
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 where it would be a good idea to move forward

536
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 making big life decisions with this.

537
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And so if that's where you are,

538
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 this is a time at least to hit pause, move out,

539
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 and likely not move on with the relationship.

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 The fourth occasion when to move on is

541
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 if you are in a relationship

542
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 that is not moving towards marriage.

543
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Our fourth idea, so we have,

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 if you're not following Jesus,

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 if followers of Jesus around you are not celebrating this,

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 going yes, yes, if you're sexually not pursuing purity,

547
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 move out, move on.

548
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And the fourth occasion is

549
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 if you are not moving towards marriage.

550
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 That dating, dating is a path.

551
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Dating is a path that leads to a promise.

552
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 You've heard us, if you've been with us for a while,

553
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 you've heard us say this before, what is dating?

554
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It's not a status on Facebook.

555
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Dating is a path, it is something you are on

556
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 that is moving towards a promise.

557
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 What promise?

558
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 That's called marriage.

559
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You in a tux, her white dress,

560
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 you stand there after the path towards marriage,

561
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 the promise, and then that leads to a lifelong pursuit.

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That's what dating is.

563
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 That means that dating should be progressing towards marriage.

564
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 It should be moving.

565
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 It's like a journey that you're on.

566
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Just like in that road trip, when I went on it,

567
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 each moment that we were on that journey,

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 which is what dating is,

569
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 you're trying to process along,

570
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 is this person the person for me to marry?

571
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I'm not just gonna perpetually date you forever.

572
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 We're gonna continue to move towards marriage,

573
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 and if it's not moving towards marriage, I'm out,

574
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 and you should be too, because it's a journey

575
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 moving towards the destination.

576
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Just like on the road trip, where we were on a journey,

577
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 and we were moving towards Florida

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 with each rotation of the tire, with each passing hour,

579
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 we were hopefully getting closer and closer.

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 If we had just stopped in Louisiana for five years,

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 you'd be like, oh, you're not on a road trip, dude.

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 You just moved.

583
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 That's what you did.

584
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 If you've been dating for five years,

585
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 you're not dating.

586
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I don't know what you're doing, but it is not dating.

587
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Dating is progressively moving towards marriage.

588
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Honestly, if you've been dating five years,

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 unless you're Corrie and Topanga in here,

590
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 (audience laughing)

591
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and what I mean by that is you started dating at 14,

592
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 which I don't know how wise that was, but you did,

593
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 and you're like, yeah, I'm a freshman.

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Great, I guess that's okay.

595
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I don't know what to think about it.

596
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 You figure it out.

597
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 But if you've been dating five years,

598
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 what are you waiting for?

599
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 What information are you lacking right now?

600
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Where you're like, I just wanna see

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 how she does at Christmas.

602
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You've had five of 'em, okay?

603
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 (audience laughing)

604
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Call it what it is.

605
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 That's called being selfish.

606
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 The most loving thing you can do is either move,

607
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 stop deceiving yourself and the relationship,

608
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 move towards marriage, or end the relationship.

609
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 The Bible only recognizes, I mean, really,

610
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 if we prolong dating, you're just like,

611
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 I'm just gonna stay here forever.

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 You're staying in a relationship

613
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 that the Bible doesn't even recognize.

614
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 You ever thought about this?

615
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 This is what's weird about it.

616
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 The Bible is it relates to men and women

617
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and their dynamics together.

618
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 For men, women can either,

619
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 they're in one of four categories.

620
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 They're either a mother, they're either a sister,

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 which you could say, hey, sisters in Christ

622
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 would fall into that.

623
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 These are the four categories as it relates to,

624
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 hey, what is the relationship of women to men

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 that the Bible recognizes?

626
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Mother, sister, or sister in Christ,

627
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 wife, and prostitute.

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Those are the four.

629
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And so, if you're prolonging staying in this stage,

630
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I don't know which one of those you're gonna fall into.

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But my guess is that if the guy is saying,

632
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 hey, I'm not willing to move forward,

633
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 or if the girl is,

634
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 there's a part of that relationship

635
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that certainly God doesn't recognize

636
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and where they're likely using the other person.

637
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Maybe both.

638
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So if you're not moving towards marriage,

639
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 it is time to move on

640
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 and to stop moving forward, but to end it.

641
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And the fifth time, so not following Christ,

642
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 if Christ followers are not celebrating, end it.

643
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 If you're not pursuing purity,

644
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and if you're not moving towards marriage,

645
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 and the final time when to break up is

646
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 before you get married.

647
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And I think in the room, everyone's like,

648
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 yeah, that goes without saying, duh.

649
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 You don't get married and then you break up.

650
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 They don't even call it that.

651
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's called divorce.

652
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 What the Bible teaches

653
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 is the reason why it's so crucial

654
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 to end a relationship before you get into marriage

655
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 is not because it's just not fun,

656
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 but it is not possible

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 to end a relationship once it moves towards marriage.

658
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It wasn't designed to be.

659
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's a covenant.

660
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And Jesus' words, and we live in a world where today,

661
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 every direction that you look, divorce is everywhere.

662
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Where we don't have a concept,

663
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 it's hard for us to grip onto this idea

664
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 that in the beginning, God created this institution,

665
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 and he says, it will never dissolve.

666
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 This relationship, when a man and a woman come together,

667
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and they're married, it's an eternal covenant,

668
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 or it's a covenant that only ends in death.

669
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 It only ends that way.

670
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And we live in a world where every direction you look,

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 divorce, Kanye screaming, we want prenup, we want prenup.

672
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Today, Brad and Angelina, I know tragically,

673
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 filed for divorce.

674
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Every direction that you look,

675
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 people are looking and going,

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 like, it's not that different from a breakup.

677
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And what the Bible teaches,

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 and specifically what Jesus says

679
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 when you read them in contrast

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 to how society views it, is breathtaking.

681
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Because Jesus, who created it,

682
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 because here's what we know about marriage, for sure.

683
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Like, we can make rules, we can add rules,

684
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 we can pass laws, we can do all kinds of things.

685
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 But here's what we know about Bible, or about marriage.

686
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 God created it.

687
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And it's his.

688
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And what he says about marriage is astounding.

689
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 We're gonna read in Mark chapter 10

690
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 of what Jesus says as it relates to the topic

691
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 of not breaking up in marriage,

692
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 not erasing a relationship, it can't be.

693
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Here's what he says.

694
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Some Pharisees came and tested him and asked him,

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?

696
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 So they come up, they're like always trying to test Jesus.

697
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 They're going, hey, Jesus, hey, is it okay?

698
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife?

699
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Jesus responds, what did Moses command you?

700
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Moses represents really this figure in the Old Testament

701
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 who gave the first five books of the Bible.

702
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So your Bible, the first five books that are in there,

703
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Moses wrote.

704
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And so he essentially says, hey,

705
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 what did Moses write down about that?

706
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 It contains the law.

707
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And they said, Moses permitted a man to write

708
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 a certificate of divorce and to send her away.

709
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 That Moses, inside of the law, said basically,

710
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 hey, divorce is possible, but if it takes place,

711
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 men have to write out and make it official

712
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 that they can't just kick their wife out,

713
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 which is what was happening, the nation of Israel,

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 because women couldn't divorce, they didn't have rights.

715
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 So men would be like, you know what?

716
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I am so tired of this woman.

717
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I'm done with you, get out of my house.

718
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And they'd be kicked out.

719
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And because they weren't divorced,

720
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 they didn't have anywhere to go.

721
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 It would look like they were just sleeping around

722
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 on different couches.

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And so Moses, because of the hardness of heart,

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 which is what Jesus says in the next verse,

725
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 it was because of the hardness of your hearts,

726
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Moses wrote this law.

727
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Hardness of heart is synonymous or interchangeable with sin

728
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 because you're sinful men.

729
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And in order to protect women,

730
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Moses wrote the divorce was possible.

731
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 He wrote it in.

732
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And they quoted Deuteronomy.

733
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And Jesus says, no, not Deuteronomy,

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 way before that, in Genesis.

735
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 What did Moses write?

736
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Here's what he says.

737
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Jesus replied, at the beginning of creation,

738
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 God made them male and female.

739
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And he quotes directly from Genesis chapter two.

740
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

741
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 and be united to his wife,

742
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 and the two will become one flesh.

743
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 So they are no longer two when they enter into marriage,

744
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 but they are one flesh.

745
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Therefore, what God has joined together,

746
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 let no one separate.

747
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Jesus, wait a second.

748
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Is it permissible to get a divorce?

749
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 If you were gonna answer what Jesus said in a word,

750
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 what would it be?

751
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 No.

752
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 But there is a question, is it even permissible?

753
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Jesus says, it's not even possible.

754
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And the disciples are all of a sudden like,

755
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 no, he can't mean that.

756
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I mean, he's always saying these crazy things, parables.

757
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 We don't know what they mean.

758
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 So he can't mean that.

759
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 And so the next verses, they're like, Jesus,

760
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 time out, let's sidebar.

761
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 What do you mean it's not even possible?

762
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Like the marriage would be over, they could remarry.

763
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And here's what they ask.

764
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 When the disciples were in the house again,

765
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 verse 10 of Mark chapter 10,

766
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 they asked Jesus about this and he answered,

767
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 anyone who divorces his wife

768
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and marries another woman

769
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 commits adultery against her.

770
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And if she divorces her husband and marries another man,

771
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 she commits adultery.

772
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 You're thinking, wait a second, Jesus.

773
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 What do you mean anyone who gets a divorce

774
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and then gets remarried is committing adultery?

775
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 I'm not sure you understand what adultery is.

776
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Adultery is when two people,

777
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 one of them who's married

778
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 and then one of them who's not,

779
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 their spouse and they have sex together.

780
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 That's what adultery is, Jesus.

781
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 If a person gets divorced and then gets remarried,

782
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 that's not adultery, that's just a remarriage.

783
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And Jesus would say,

784
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 that's because you don't understand marriage.

785
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 A court may have recognized, oh, the divorce, it ended.

786
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 But God hasn't.

787
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 That there's something permanent

788
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 where God has joined the two together

789
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 and just getting a piece of paper and filing it,

790
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Jesus says, does not dissolve the relationship.

791
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 As in if they get remarried, they're committing adultery.

792
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And the reason that we're hitting on this

793
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 is because as you head towards the path

794
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 and that promise,

795
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 you need to know where you're heading into.

796
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 That it doesn't just end the relationship

797
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 and hey, you're free to do whatever you want.

798
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 You may experience separation or divorce legally,

799
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 but that does not necessarily, according to Jesus,

800
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 mean that God has recognized that.

801
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 And regardless, and there's some gray areas

802
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and if you're wrestling in the room,

803
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 we did a message back in 2014 in Battle of the Sexes

804
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 where we cover that very explicitly

805
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 in case you're going, what about, what about, what about?

806
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Which I am too when I read that passage.

807
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 In fact, the other section where Jesus teaches this

808
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 in Matthew 19, it creates such confusion among the crowd

809
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 that literally the response it says in there,

810
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Matthew 19, verse 10, it says,

811
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 the audience was like, wait, we must not understand you

812
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 because if this is what you're saying,

813
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 then it's better to not get married.

814
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I mean, am I right?

815
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 And Jesus literally, you would expect him to be like,

816
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 no, marriage is amazing.

817
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 God loves this thing.

818
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 You've gotta do it.

819
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 He essentially goes, man, well,

820
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 some people can handle the truth, some people can't,

821
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 and he walks off.

822
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 (audience laughing)

823
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And that's it.

824
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 But that's the response in the audience.

825
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So if that's the response in the room

826
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 and you're like, no, maybe better not get married then,

827
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 you probably are coming close to what Jesus says.

828
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 It's permanent.

829
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And there may be some unclear parts,

830
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 or you may wrestle.

831
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 There's people who land a little bit differently

832
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 on different areas because there's a couple passages

833
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 that are tricky.

834
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And so if you're wondering about those,

835
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 go listen to that message

836
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 where we address abuse, abandonment, adultery.

837
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 But go listen to that.

838
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Watermark stance as a whole for you to know

839
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 is that the elders today have landed

840
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 that if a person gets divorced,

841
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 they are to pursue reconciliation with their spouse

842
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 until they die or until they get married,

843
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 the other spouse gets married.

844
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 But if they're here and being shepherded,

845
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 we would say, hey, continue to pursue reconciliation.

846
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 If there's abuse, of course, move out.

847
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 We don't want anyone being put in danger

848
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 or children put in danger.

849
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 But God's best would be for you to prayerfully

850
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 continue to pursue reconciliation

851
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 and wait until that person's death ends the marriage

852
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 or they get remarried and they put a stake in the ground

853
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 and permanently end it.

854
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 But if you're asking us, we would say,

855
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 you should not put the stake in the ground.

856
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And so that's our stance.

857
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 There's godly men who disagree

858
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 on small, different little ways

859
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 'cause there's a little bit of gray.

860
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 But we extend grace to them, and hopefully they do to us.

861
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 But if you're married or you have been divorced in the room

862
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 and it's a part of your story,

863
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 you've gotta wrestle with that.

864
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Like, you need to be an expert on these passages.

865
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Because the idea that the common belief for most,

866
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 even Christians, is like, yes,

867
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 but if they cheat on you, it's done.

868
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And it's just not that clear.

869
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 We would say that's not true

870
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 because of the teachings that Jesus presents in the Bible.

871
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 And so we don't have time to go into all of that,

872
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 but if that is something where you have questions raised,

873
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 we can talk afterwards,

874
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 or you can go check out the Battle of the Sexes matches,

875
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 when to break up and when not to,

876
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 and find out more, or search on Watermark's website.

877
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 It's the last time and occasion to not get a divorce

878
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 is when it's marriage, or before you get married

879
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 excuse me, the last occasion to not break up

880
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 is before you get married.

881
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Or make sure that you break up before you get married,

882
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 while it's still possible.

883
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 So the application in the room,

884
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 if that's a part of your story,

885
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 is that if it is not a part of your story,

886
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 the application for many of us may be

887
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 that we need to break up.

888
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 That you may be in a spot where you need to just re-evaluate,

889
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 hey, is this, if any of those things are true,

890
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 let me just put it this clearly,

891
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 if any of the lists that we just covered,

892
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 and you're a Christian,

893
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 if they're true about your relationship,

894
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 it's not optional.

895
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 You gotta break up.

896
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Like this isn't like, hey, just feel it out,

897
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 you know, whatever you think is best.

898
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 It's what God's word has said.

899
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 And how do you do that?

900
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Maybe tonight, that's you, you sit down,

901
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 and you get together, and you say,

902
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 hey, I think we need to break up.

903
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 And here's the ways that you do that.

904
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 You do that in person.

905
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 You don't send a tweet, or a text,

906
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 or a Snapchat after, and be like, it's over, bae.

907
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 You don't say any of that.

908
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 You sit down, and you say,

909
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 hey, I don't think this in person.

910
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 The first thing is in person.

911
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 The second thing is you speak the truth in love.

912
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 We're Christians.

913
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 We don't lie.

914
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 We're honest.

915
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And we're lovingly honest.

916
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 Ephesians 4 says speak the truth in love.

917
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 So you sit down, you say the truth,

918
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 you don't blame it on God,

919
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 you don't over-spiritualize it,

920
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 you say, this is what's going on,

921
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 this is why I don't think we should move forward.

922
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And then you stand firm.

923
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 You cut off all communication.

924
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 You can say, hey, I'm deleting your phone number,

925
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 I think you should delete mine.

926
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 You don't text the next day and be like,

927
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 are we still going to that Jason Mraz concert?

928
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 You don't do any of that.

929
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 You stand firm, you move on.

930
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 You don't just be like, man,

931
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 I was in the radio, played our song,

932
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 and I was just like, hey, how's she doing?

933
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 It's been three days.

934
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 You don't do that.

935
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 You stand firm.

936
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 But for all of us, I think the teaching

937
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 that I need to be reminded of constantly

938
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 is how permanent marriage is.

939
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 And here's why.

940
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Because I think a lot of people are like,

941
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 man, it's just so offensive, you guys are so intense.

942
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 It's Jesus's words.

943
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Honestly, I'm as uncomfortable as you are

944
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 if you're uncomfortable with him.

945
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 But here's why God did such a big deal to God

946
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 about marriage.

947
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Because marriage, ultimately, it's not about you

948
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 and it's not about me.

949
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 It's not even about man and woman, so to speak.

950
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 What the Bible says about marriage

951
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 is that in the beginning,

952
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 even from the beginning of time,

953
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 it has always been, human marriage has always been

954
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 pointing to the marriage between Christ and his church.

955
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 At every wedding that I do,

956
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 I read Ephesians chapter five.

957
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 In it, Paul says, look, for this reason,

958
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 a man will leave his father and mother

959
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 and be united to his wife,

960
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 and two will become one flesh.

961
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 This is a profound mystery.

962
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And you go, wow, man, that is profound.

963
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Two becoming one, wow.

964
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And Paul goes, but I am talking about Christ and the church.

965
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I'm not even talking about man and wife becoming one.

966
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Like, that's mysterious.

967
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 But the profound one is that

968
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 this has always been about Jesus.

969
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 It has always been about his unending,

970
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 unbreakable love for his bride, the church.

971
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And that's why marriage is such a big deal to God.

972
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 'Cause he says it's an unending covenant

973
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 between me and my bride.

974
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 That's what marriage is.

975
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 And it'll never break, it'll never stop.

976
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 And human marriage is just a picture of that,

977
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 where God has given us that permanent covenant.

978
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 I think if you are in the room,

979
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 and you're gonna break up,

980
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 and I'll close right here, and we'll land the plane.

981
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 I think the challenge, let me just close the story.

982
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I'll finish the story and then come back to it.

983
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 So I go in, I'm at the door.

984
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 I can see the Tahoe of a bunch of guys that are like,

985
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 man, we gotta get out of this car.

986
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Please bring us the key back.

987
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And I'm hitting the door, and I, hit by conviction,

988
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 I can't keep moving forward, I gotta go back.

989
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 I go back to the desk.

990
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 And all of a sudden, I'm playing in my mind,

991
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 I'm like, oh my gosh,

992
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 I wonder how many rooms at La Quinta we're gonna need,

993
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 and what are we gonna do?

994
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And I can see the pool, oh,

995
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 and we haven't showered in so long,

996
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 and I don't wanna get back in that smelly Tahoe,

997
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 please, lady.

998
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 And all these things are flashing in my mind,

999
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 like I know where this is going,

1000
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 I know what she's about to say,

1001
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 I know what's about to happen.

1002
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 I get there, and I tell the lady,

1003
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 I say, hey, look, you said,

1004
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 is someone family?

1005
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And no one is.

1006
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 I'm not a member of the family,

1007
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 they're not a member of the family.

1008
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 And so I don't know what that means,

1009
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 but I do know that we were told by the family

1010
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 that we could stay here.

1011
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 And she says, oh, okay,

1012
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 well, let me contact the family,

1013
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 they have a contact number listed here,

1014
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 I'm gonna call 'em.

1015
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 She calls 'em,

1016
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 and which even that was a positive,

1017
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 I was like, man, awesome,

1018
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 I think we were just gonna say go away.

1019
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 And she begins to call 'em,

1020
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 and she gets a hold of 'em.

1021
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 And they confirm, like, oh yeah,

1022
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 we told 'em, it's totally fine.

1023
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 And so I go from like, oh no,

1024
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 where are we gonna go?

1025
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 She's like, they're great with it,

1026
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 here's the key, move on.

1027
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 And I was thinking about that,

1028
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 and everything that I thought,

1029
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 like I was like, I know where this is gonna go,

1030
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 I know what's gonna happen,

1031
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 I know what's behind that door.

1032
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 If I choose obedience here,

1033
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 if I choose to like go back

1034
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 and not move forward,

1035
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 man, I'm gonna end up at La Quinta in Alabama,

1036
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 which did not take place.

1037
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 I keep saying La Quinta,

1038
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 what is wrong with me?

1039
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Sorry if you work for La Quinta,

1040
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 it's a great hotel.

1041
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 (audience laughing)

1042
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 Man, it is, it's great, I love it.

1043
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Continental Breakfast.

1044
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Okay, so I'm like seeing everything

1045
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 that's gonna happen,

1046
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 I can see it all,

1047
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 oh, this is all that's gonna happen.

1048
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 All of a sudden, it turns on its head,

1049
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 ends up being way better

1050
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 than I could have imagined.

1051
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 Like, had I chosen to move forward,

1052
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 like had I chosen to just go through that door

1053
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 and hey, I'm gonna deal with it

1054
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 and choose with it,

1055
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 all the consequences would have come

1056
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 as throughout that week,

1057
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 I would have been constantly

1058
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 looking over my shoulder being like,

1059
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 oh my gosh, do they know

1060
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 that we're not the McLaughlin family?

1061
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Do they know, like I'm avoiding the front desk

1062
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 and being like, no one's here.

1063
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 It would have been all this moment

1064
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 of like, what if we get caught?

1065
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 What if they catch us?

1066
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 Essentially, it's like breaking and entering.

1067
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Essentially, it's like saying

1068
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 we're someone we're not

1069
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 and we're living here.

1070
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 All these different thoughts

1071
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 going through my head,

1072
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it.

1073
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 And what I thought would be

1074
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 walking through this door,

1075
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I know what's gonna happen.

1076
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 It's gonna be terrible.

1077
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 It was not at all that way.

1078
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 It was way better than I could have imagined.

1079
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 When I chose to do, if you will,

1080
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 the right thing or to not move forward.

1081
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 And the reality is for most of us in the room,

1082
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 because here's what I know about you.

1083
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 If you're sitting in the room

1084
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 and you're like, man,

1085
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 I think I may be in need of a breakup,

1086
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 but I'm gonna be honest.

1087
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 I'm not gonna do that.

1088
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 That is not gonna happen.

1089
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 Yep, I hear all the reasons.

1090
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Yeah, it's kind of fun.

1091
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 And yeah, I like the funny jokes,

1092
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 but yeah, we are not breaking up.

1093
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 It's just not practical.

1094
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 I mean, come on, dude.

1095
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 We got a song.

1096
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 I have a vacation planned.

1097
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 I mean, this is not realistic for us to break up.

1098
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 And the reason why that is for you

1099
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 is because as you're thinking about it,

1100
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 you're going, man, look,

1101
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 as bad as it is,

1102
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 as much as we're probably breaking

1103
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 one of those things we shouldn't be doing,

1104
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 here's what I know.

1105
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 If I walk through that door called breakup,

1106
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 I know what's on the other side.

1107
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 And you're convincing yourself

1108
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 that like on the other side,

1109
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 it's gonna be pain,

1110
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 it's gonna be heartbreak,

1111
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 it's gonna be less than best,

1112
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 it's gonna be not good.

1113
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 And hey, look,

1114
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 the relationship's not that good right now.

1115
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 We're not that close spiritually.

1116
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 It's not going as well as I'd like it to.

1117
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Maybe we don't have all the things

1118
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 that God says we should,

1119
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 but I know what,

1120
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 if I traded in for what's

1121
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 on the other side of that door,

1122
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 it's gonna be worse.

1123
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 And you have fallen for a lie.

1124
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 Anytime that you choose

1125
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 to be obedient to what God says,

1126
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 always you're moving the direction

1127
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 of what is best for you,

1128
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 what is best according to God.

1129
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 And right now you're sitting,

1130
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 let's call it what it is.

1131
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 The reason why you're going,

1132
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 I'm not gonna break up

1133
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 is 'cause you're afraid.

1134
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 You don't trust God.

1135
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 If you're saying,

1136
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 look, I know that God's word says that,

1137
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 but I'm not gonna do it.

1138
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 You don't trust God.

1139
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 You don't trust that

1140
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 he really knows what's best.

1141
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 And maybe you should just stay

1142
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 in the relationship and say,

1143
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 look, I'm gonna keep this relationship

1144
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 because I don't trust God.

1145
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 We're gonna date 'cause I don't trust God.

1146
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 And the tragedy there

1147
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 is that God who loves you

1148
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 has invited you

1149
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 and has promised to you

1150
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 that if you will just take a step

1151
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 in his direction,

1152
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 it will always work for your good.

1153
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 It will always work to make him more famous

1154
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 or his glory and for your good.

1155
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Because he's a God

1156
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 who's not here to rip you off.

1157
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 He's not here to take some relationship from you.

1158
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 He's here to give you life.

1159
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 He's way more concerned

1160
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 about your dating relationship,

1161
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 your love life than you are.

1162
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 He's way more passionate

1163
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 about you having an amazing marriage

1164
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 than you are.

1165
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 And he's way more in love with you

1166
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 than whoever you're dating is.

1167
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 How do I know that to be true?

1168
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 How could that be true, David?

1169
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 Have you not seen,

1170
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 have you not heard the story

1171
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 of the God who entered creation?

1172
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 Why? Because he loves you.

1173
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Because he came

1174
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 to have a relationship with you.

1175
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 He entered the creation.

1176
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 He came, he died on a cross

1177
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 made out of wood that he created,

1178
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 that he by the word of his power

1179
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 held together in a moment

1180
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 to die for you because he loves you.

1181
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 How do you know,

1182
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 how do I know that you can trust him?

1183
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 I can trust him

1184
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 that anytime that we move

1185
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 in his direction, as he said,

1186
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 if you will trust me,

1187
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 it will work for your good.

1188
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Because 2,000 years ago,

1189
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 on the day that love won,

1190
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 it was perfectly displayed.

1191
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 I'm a God who wants

1192
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 a relationship with you,

1193
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 who has invited you

1194
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 to the ultimate marriage.

1195
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 You can trust me

1196
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 with whatever little thing

1197
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 you're holding onto.

1198
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 And you choosing disobedience

1199
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 will only bring you pain.

1200
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Please, I'm gonna land the plane.

1201
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Please, if you were

1202
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 in one of these relationships

1203
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 and you were afraid of being single,

1204
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 you're afraid of being alone,

1205
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 man, or right now,

1206
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 you're being tempted to date someone

1207
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 who's outside of God's best,

1208
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 please listen to me.

1209
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 I see this every single week.

1210
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Minister, you're filled

1211
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 with all these different

1212
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 ministerial conversations,

1213
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 all these different

1214
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 counseling sessions.

1215
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 Please, it is so much better

1216
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 for you to be single

1217
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 than for you to be poorly married.

1218
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 It is so much better,

1219
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 I promise you,

1220
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 and it's gonna be impossible

1221
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 for you to believe.

1222
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 It is so much better

1223
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 for you to be lonely right now

1224
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 for a little bit.

1225
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 As you wait for God's man

1226
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 and God's woman to come around,

1227
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 it is so much better

1228
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 for that loneliness,

1229
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 if you feel it right now,

1230
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 that is such a much better loneliness

1231
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 than the people

1232
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 who are lonely and married.

1233
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 And I see 'em every week,

1234
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 I see 'em.

1235
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 And who are you gonna trust?

1236
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 You're gonna really trust

1237
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 that you know what's best,

1238
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 you know how to date you

1239
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 and your boo,

1240
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 you know what's best,

1241
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 or are you gonna hand over

1242
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 your life to the God

1243
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 who created you,

1244
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 wired, created marriage,

1245
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 and loves you more

1246
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 than he ever will

1247
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 or she ever will?

1248
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 And honestly,

1249
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 even that you love yourself

1250
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 and is the only one

1251
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 who offers that contentment,

1252
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 offers the ability

1253
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 to have the relationship,

1254
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 the marriage, the perspective

1255
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 that all of us need,

1256
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 that you were made for,

1257
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 and that ultimately

1258
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 you all desire in this room,

1259
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 including myself,

1260
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 whether or not we know it.

1261
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 We pray that we would.

1262
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Father, would you help

1263
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 my friends in the room,

1264
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 gosh, Lord,

1265
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 do what I can't do,

1266
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 do what no message could do,

1267
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 what no song could do,

1268
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 which is trust you.

1269
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Your word is spoken clearly

1270
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 on so many different issues

1271
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 and so many different arenas

1272
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 and so many different scenarios

1273
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 that many of us

1274
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 are in right now, Lord,

1275
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 so I'm asking by your spirit

1276
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 for my friends

1277
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 who are Christians in the room,

1278
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 not the ones who just say,

1279
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 oh yeah, I go to church every once,

1280
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 but those who say,

1281
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Jesus, you're the Lord of my life.

1282
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Would your spirit now

1283
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 press on their heart,

1284
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 not because you're angry with them

1285
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 or you want to hurt them

1286
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 or you want them to experience pain,

1287
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 but because you want them

1288
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 to walk through a door

1289
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 that on the other side

1290
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 is better than they can

1291
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 even believe right now?

1292
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 Would you lead them

1293
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 to follow you in obedience

1294
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 towards what's always best?

1295
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 God, thank you that you proved

1296
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 your love for us.

1297
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 And in you, we get to experience

1298
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 and be a part of the ultimate marriage

1299
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 and will for all eternity.

1300
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 We worship you now in song.

1301
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 May we worship you

1302
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 in the way that we date, love, live,

1303
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 and have our being, amen.
