[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:29.860]   All right.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.760]   Hey, welcome everybody in the room, everybody tuning in,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   wherever you are tuning in from.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.520]   PortsLive locations, Ports, Tulsa, Midland, Indy, Scottsdale,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.040]   Boise, Houston, everywhere.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.540]   Welcome.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.440]   We're continuing this series, His and Hers,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.520]   and looking at a biblical perspective on dating.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.600]   We start this way.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   I have been coaching my son's soccer team
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.200]   for the past three years.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.320]   And we have successfully gone defeated, completely.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.240]   We have not won a game.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.120]   That is, until last Saturday.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.620]   OK?
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.840]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.340]   Thank you.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.360]   That's it.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.400]   I'm closing prayer.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.920]   OK?
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.240]   So last Saturday, we finally had our win.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.480]   It was 4 to 2.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.640]   Yes, one of the goals that made up our 4
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.360]   was actually scored by the other team on themselves.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.400]   But that doesn't matter, because we still
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.760]   would have won it 3 to 2.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.080]   And I've noticed something when I coach 6-year-old, 5-year-old,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080]   and 4-year-old soccer that happens every single game
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.360]   without fail.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.920]   Midway through first quarter, second quarter,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.240]   happens all throughout the game.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720]   One of the kids on the team will run up to me and just do this.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.440]   And he looks at me, and he's stretching out his foot,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.320]   and he's showing my shoes untied.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.200]   And so I say, hey, ref, timeout, bend over, tie his shoe,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480]   try to double knot it.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.520]   Inevitably, it'll come undone.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.320]   And they almost rotate on who's going
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.600]   to have an untied shoe throughout the game.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680]   And if you're 6 and 5, it's normal,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.000]   because a 6-year-old, they can't tie their shoe.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   It's too complicated, which is why they often
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.640]   are wearing Velcro shoes, which apparently have come back,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.800]   which is so bizarre.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.160]   But anyways, this will happen, and it's normal.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.120]   I mean, there's things that you, at some point,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.080]   couldn't tie your shoe, and you had
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   to have a grown-up or an adult come in and help
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   you tie your shoes.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   And that is just one of many things that you have outgrown.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.640]   And as you have grown in life, you have put behind you
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.760]   is no longer in your past.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.480]   The things from your childhood, the things
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600]   you used to play with, the way you used to think,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   the person you were, the things that mattered,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   your perspective on the opposite sex,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.080]   it changes as you grow up.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.840]   And I start there because the Apostle Paul,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.120]   in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, he's talking about love.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   And at the end of this section on love,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.720]   he brings up a very similar idea that's relevant
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.800]   to where we're going tonight, and to this idea
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900]   of outgrowing from childhood.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.840]   In other words, if you tomorrow at work,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.240]   someone came up to you, and just like the 6-year-olds
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.960]   on my soccer team, they extended your foot in front of you,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.560]   and they were like, "Hey, can you help me tie my shoe?"
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   And it's your coworker or your friend at work,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   you'd be like, "Are you serious?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040]   "This is bizarre."
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.760]   'Cause you know and understand we grow out of things.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.800]   And the Apostle Paul talks about love,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.460]   and as he ends that section, he says,
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.140]   "When I was a child, I talked like a child.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.060]   "I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180]   "But when I became a man,
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.720]   "I put the ways of childhood behind me."
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.000]   It's a very simple idea, and so maybe you're wondering,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.960]   what does that have to do with dating?
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.480]   Well, I think most of the challenges and problems
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.920]   and dysfunctional dating relationships that are represented
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   in this room, maybe are a part of some of your story
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   and some of my story, are the result of never growing out
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.880]   and putting the ways of childhood behind you
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360]   as it relates to dating.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.600]   In other words, you no longer have to have somebody else
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.400]   tie your shoes, and a million other things
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.720]   that you have grown out of.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.760]   But it seems like dating is the one arena
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.620]   across the board in society where we revert
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.440]   to childish ways of thinking and living.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.720]   And now, we don't call it childish and dating,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.420]   and nobody's ever told you, hey, you know what,
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.560]   the problem with all the different broken relations
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.520]   you have is it's just too childish.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.280]   So it's childish dating.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.160]   We have another term that we use to describe
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.480]   someone behaving childish in dating, and it's this word.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.980]   It's complicated.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.300]   Oh man, dating, it's just, it's complicated.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.900]   Are you and her, like, are y'all a thing?
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.100]   It's complicated.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.940]   What happened?
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.500]   You guys were like together, and then did y'all break up?
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.720]   It's complicated.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.580]   Now, why do I say that's childish?
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.440]   Well, if you take something that is designed for an adult,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.340]   and you give it to a child, they will say,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.680]   it's too complicated.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.540]   You take shoes that are meant to be tied,
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.980]   and you hand it to a six-year-old, a child,
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.920]   and they'll go, it's too complicated.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.060]   And for whatever reason, as it relates to dating,
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.860]   and love, and relationships,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.620]   the reason we describe it as complicated
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.060]   is because of childish ways of thinking.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.020]   Even as Paul lays out, hey, here's what it looks to have
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.020]   a mature perspective on love,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.580]   which is what he says in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.380]   and he lists out, which is where the verse
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.420]   that I read a second ago ends.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.060]   He says, love is patient.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.980]   Here's a mature perspective on love.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.360]   Love is kind, it doesn't envy or boast, it's not proud.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.660]   Love doesn't dishonor others.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.620]   It is not self-seeking.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.180]   It's not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.060]   It doesn't delight in evil, but in the truth.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.660]   It always protects, always trusts,
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.640]   always hopes, always perseveres.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.220]   Love never fails.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.740]   When I was a child, I thought like a child,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.920]   talked like a child, reasoned.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.820]   I became a man, put those ways behind me.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.780]   And you think about childish behavior,
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.780]   it's, you know, they're not patient.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.660]   If you've ever been around nieces, nephews, younger kids,
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.640]   I mean, they're anything but patient.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.980]   They throw temper tantrums, they lose control.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.620]   If they don't give it what they want,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.440]   they're selfish, childlike behavior.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.380]   And that's really what leads that type of behavior
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.780]   in adults in dating relationships leads
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.980]   to us describing something that God doesn't want
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.620]   to be complicated as it's complicated.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.380]   So here's what I want to do tonight.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.220]   Last week, we opened up and talked about,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.620]   hey, these are three things to consider
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.380]   before you start dating.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.100]   Tonight, for those of us in the room
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.140]   that are in a good place spiritually,
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.580]   with the Savior, with our Lord, we know Jesus,
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.100]   we're following Him, we're not perfect,
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.940]   but we are interested in honoring Him
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.020]   in our dating relationships,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.340]   and in a place where we feel like we could date,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.500]   I want to uncomplicate dating.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.780]   We're gonna look at 10 things, so I'm gonna fly,
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.100]   but if you've ever wanted to have a dating relationship
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.680]   that is described not as complicated,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.980]   but as healthy and life-giving
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.980]   and leading to a particular destination, this is for you.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.700]   And so we're gonna spend the next 30 minutes
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.700]   on uncomplicating dating, uncomplicating dating.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.540]   Before I do, if you are new
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.180]   or maybe not that familiar with the Bible,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.700]   this may surprise you,
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.660]   but the Bible not a single time mentions dating.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.100]   There's no occasions where it describes, you know,
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.140]   Joseph was picking up Mary on the camel
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.320]   and they were headed to Olive Garden
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.540]   and this is what happened there.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.220]   'Cause dating is a relatively new invention.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.060]   It's only been around 150 years, 100 years,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.820]   around the same amount of time as the automobile.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.540]   And so I wanna fly through even some of the history
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.500]   to put into context the history of dating,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.140]   and then we're gonna launch into 10 things
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.780]   to uncomplicate your dating relationships.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.700]   So dating was first used,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.620]   it first appeared in literature in 1896.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.920]   So this is just a brief history of even dating,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.580]   how long it's been around, what it has involved.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.780]   In 1896, it was used to describe in a slang way
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.740]   or a slang reference for prostitution.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.380]   Going on a date was a euphemism for paying for sex.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.060]   At that time, you didn't go on a date,
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.180]   arranged marriages happened,
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.140]   or you would court someone in front of their parents,
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.660]   at their parents' home.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.660]   And as society began to change, that began to change.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.580]   By the 1900s, courtship had switched into dating,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.340]   and by 1930s, the invention of the automobile
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.820]   took relationships outside of the home.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.600]   And dating became more and increasingly
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   more and more normal.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.660]   Even the invention and advent of makeup
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.660]   is beginning to take place and be partaken in
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.100]   widely at this time.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.780]   Around the 1930s, a man would call on a girl
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.740]   and he would ask her to go out on a date.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.380]   In the 1940s, the prevalence skyrocketed.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.140]   It became the most common way that people
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.420]   would end up marrying someone around.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.100]   A man would pick up a girl, drive her in the car,
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.160]   go on a date, and here we go.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.060]   By the 1950s, the term going steady
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.460]   began to be used to describe not just going on dates,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.900]   but hey, I am exclusively dating this person.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.620]   In the 1960s, everything dramatically changed.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.480]   Sexual revolution, which you may or may not
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.060]   be familiar with, but in the course of a short number
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.880]   of years, sex and the way that the American perspective
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.180]   on sexuality drastically changed.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.540]   The invention and introduction of reliable birth control
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.100]   and the passing of Roe versus Wade
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.540]   took away the consequences of sex.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.540]   In particular, it allowed sex to be taken
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.020]   outside of the context of marriage
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.140]   and it became coupled with dating.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.460]   In the 1970s, Playboy comes onto the scene,
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.700]   it begins to alter and transform along with Hollywood
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.080]   and different perspectives,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.380]   even how feminine beauty was perceived.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.460]   By the 1980s, the internet is introduced,
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.520]   providing further outlets for sex appeal.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.780]   Pornography comes along.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.420]   By the 1990s, you have movies, music, Hollywood,
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.620]   which all play significant roles.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.820]   The explosion of the rom-com in the late '90s.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.720]   And then by the 2000s, we have the smartphone
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.340]   and dating apps and people are meeting more online
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.420]   than ever before.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.660]   So that's a brief history.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.060]   But unlike certain arenas, where over time
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.540]   we seem to be getting better,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.100]   that doesn't appear to be the case in dating
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.100]   because it's complicated.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.100]   And in our world, it feels like everywhere you look,
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.980]   everyone would describe it as just, it's a pain,
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.980]   it's brutal, it's something that is not done well.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:16.300]   And God doesn't want that to be the case for you.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.860]   And so we're gonna look at 10 principles
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.720]   that are really taking 1 Corinthians 13
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.580]   and the biblical commands to love, consider,
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.700]   honor, and care for one another
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.420]   and walk through how to apply those in a dating context.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.380]   Y'all ready?
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.700]   So I'm gonna fly.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.040]   First one, don't date just for fun.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.540]   Don't date just for fun.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.560]   This shouldn't need to be said,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.420]   but what I don't mean is don't have fun in dating.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.020]   You can have fun, should have fun in dating,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.460]   but don't date just for fun.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.060]   In other words, if you are dating someone
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.140]   with no purpose and no intention and no desire
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.260]   and no plan and no foreseeable marriage
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.060]   in your future at all, you're just dating
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.700]   'cause you're bored and you want attention
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.900]   from the opposite sex, you should not be dating.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.500]   That's childlike thinking.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.780]   And you're a follower of Jesus.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.260]   You're putting the ways of childhood behind you.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.580]   You're embracing a mature perspective on love.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.200]   And it is not a mature or honoring thing
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.700]   to play with someone's heart and mess with their emotions
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.780]   and lead them on a journey if you have no intention
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.900]   of moving towards a destination
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.260]   with that person in that relationship.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.140]   Dating, as I've said before, it's a path,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.240]   like you're walking on it, that should lead to a place
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.420]   where there's a promise.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.300]   That's you, white dress, him, black tux,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.360]   standing in front of each other saying I do.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.820]   That leads to a lifelong pursuit, path, promise, pursuit.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.300]   If you are on that path and you are aimlessly
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.340]   and going nowhere, you are not ready to date.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.640]   That's childlike thinking.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.940]   But we, as followers of Jesus, we have a mature.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.080]   So we see dating, dating is not just something for fun.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.540]   Dating is meant to lead to a destination of marriage,
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.760]   and that informs how I continue in a relationship
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.420]   if I'm going to or if I see this relationship needs to end
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.660]   'cause it's not progressing.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.700]   In other words, dating is like going to the airport.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.460]   No one in the history of history has ever said,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.580]   you know what, I'm bored this weekend.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.280]   What do you say we go hang at the airport?
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.880]   Well, you're not going anywhere, you're not flying.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.400]   I know, it's awesome.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.700]   They got like the Annie Ann's pretzels in there
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.580]   and everything's four times as expensive
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.100]   as it is in the normal world,
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.500]   and we can just hang around and it'll be great.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.460]   You never heard anybody say that, why?
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.420]   Because you only go to the airport
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.160]   as a step to get you towards your destination.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.380]   Dating is something that you only go towards
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.620]   as a step to get you towards your destination.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.680]   If you're not ready or marriage is off the table
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.660]   and that is something you don't have any interest in,
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.660]   or in the next 18 or so months, you would say,
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.140]   man, I just have no interest.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.920]   I'm completely opposed to getting married in the near future.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.420]   Then you shouldn't be dating.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.540]   Proverbs chapter four says that you are to guard your heart
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.060]   and you take the scriptural principles
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.260]   from first Corinthians 13 of,
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260]   hey, love honors the other person.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.820]   It is not honoring to lead someone on with no intent
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.320]   of seeing that lead to a destination of marriage.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.780]   For Christians, it's been said that dating
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.980]   without the intent of marriage
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.440]   is like shopping with no money.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.920]   You either leave frustrated
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.280]   or taking something that doesn't belong to you.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.080]   It's like you go to the mall and walking around Nordstrom's
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.320]   or going to whatever store you are
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.640]   and you're like, man, I don't have any money.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.320]   You're either gonna be tempted to steal something
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.640]   that doesn't belong to you
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.440]   or you're just going to leave frustrated.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.900]   And so is the case with dating,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.280]   that dating is not something that we as believers in Christ
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.380]   do just for fun.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.680]   As I said, don't date forever.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.480]   It's my opinion that if getting married
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.960]   in the next 18 months is something
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.080]   you are totally opposed to,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.900]   I'm not saying you're guaranteeing it has to happen,
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.640]   but you're going, man, I just have no interest
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.240]   in getting married anytime soon.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   Then you should have no interest in dating anytime soon.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.320]   And that's okay.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.600]   All right, number two.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.720]   We've said this before, but it's worth repeating.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.680]   And candidly, I wish I could spend an entire message
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.580]   just on this one.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.880]   Men, ask women on dates.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.400]   Ask women on dates.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.000]   Now, let me, yeah, I saw that coming.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.200]   Woo, yeah!
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.400]   If there is a godly girl,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.880]   and you know her as a godly girl,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.480]   and how, I'm not saying a stranger,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.280]   I mean a godly girl, you're a godly guy
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.480]   and you have interest in dating,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.440]   you're going to go up to her
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   and you are going to ask her on a date.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.840]   When you do, you're going to use the word date.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   You're going to give specific plans.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.320]   You're going to go up to her and say,
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.800]   hey, Marissa, I would like to take you on a date.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.040]   This next Saturday, Marissa, she is pumped.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.840]   In fact, stand up, Marissa,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.720]   and we'll have everyone know where to go.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.520]   Okay, you're going to go up to her
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.780]   and you're going to give a specific plan and intention.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.920]   You're going to have thought it out.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.760]   You're going to have a plan.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.680]   You're going to go, Marissa, I'd like to take you on a date
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.500]   this Saturday to a Mavericks game.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.540]   Afterwards, I'd like to go to dinner, or before.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.960]   You're going to show her, I put time,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.640]   I've thought about it, I have a plan,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.880]   and I'm going to give her an out.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   If you can't do it or you're not interested, that's okay.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.600]   You honor her by giving clarity
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.580]   and you're allowing her to evaluate
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.480]   and decide what you're asking her.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.720]   In other words, you're not just going to say,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.000]   you got anything going on Saturday?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.720]   Or are you in town next weekend?
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.360]   Or text her W-Y-D.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.420]   You're going to ask her,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:35.120]   I would like to take you on a date.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.980]   And this is speaking to the guys
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.860]   who this is a godly girl in your life,
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.240]   and there's a lot of them, candidly.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.040]   I wish I could just get all the guys
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.500]   who are already in a place
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.320]   and they're interested in dating
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.540]   and get together and charge you up and say,
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.060]   man, ask a godly girl on a date that you know.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.180]   Not a beautiful girl that you know.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.720]   So if you don't know her, you don't know if she's godly.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.200]   You just saw her and like the way that she looks.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.100]   I'm saying a godly girl that you know
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.940]   and have a relationship with and you go up to her,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.820]   and is it going to risk rejection?
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.620]   Yes, and girls, you just need to know this.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.340]   Guys, we don't like to risk rejection.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.020]   We want to, as best we can, self-protect.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.940]   But men, you are next level, you're mature love.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.580]   You're not childish, kids are afraid of,
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.620]   they're gonna be childish.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.900]   You're a man, you're gonna go up
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.180]   and you're gonna risk rejection.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.620]   And you know what may happen?
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.060]   She may say no.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:26.380]   And if she does, I am so proud
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.340]   that you honored her, you honored God,
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.900]   you brought clarity to the relationship,
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.780]   and you did it right, regardless of what she says.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.300]   And you ask women on dates.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.020]   Now, to the ladies, number three.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.460]   Women, say yes to dates.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.020]   Hold on.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:49.500]   Good night, everybody, all right.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   Let me unpack what I mean,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.700]   'cause I'm not just saying say yes to anybody.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.900]   I'm saying you say yes to a date,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   not W-Y-D, not you up, not wanna watch Netflix on Saturday.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.740]   You say yes to a date, and if a guy comes up to you
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.660]   and he asks you, and I mean a godly guy,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.380]   it's my opinion, if a godly guy asked you on a date,
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.500]   I would say yes to a date.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.180]   I wouldn't dial that down, I'm just giving my opinion.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.680]   But if a godly guy comes up to you,
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.380]   or someone asks you on a date,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.420]   or someone asks you, hey, are you in town next weekend?
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.680]   You look at them and say, are you asking me on a date,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.540]   or just interested in my schedule?
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.020]   And you've forced him to drive clarity
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.720]   into that relationship, or into what he is asking.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.520]   And you don't allow anyone to treat you with dishonor.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.200]   That you force, hey, what are you asking me on?
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.600]   Is it okay for girls to ask guys on dates?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.880]   Hold on, hold on.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.860]   Y'all are something else tonight, man.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:06.320]   Sure, there's no biblical verse that would prohibit that.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.460]   In my opinion, I don't think that's best,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.300]   and here's why.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.000]   Because God has called and gives the husband,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.600]   which he's not your husband,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.600]   the responsibility to lead, and love, and serve,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.560]   and leadership biblically is servant,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.260]   or being a servant, chief servant.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.560]   And part of the reason I think that's not ideal,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.840]   in my opinion, is it could increase and create a culture
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.520]   that increases passivity on men.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.060]   And God is calling men, men, just like with women,
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.580]   not to be childish.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.220]   Remember, we put the ways of childhood behind us.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.020]   We can tie our shoes, we can learn how to date,
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.100]   like mature followers of Jesus.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.520]   And so in my opinion, it's not ideal.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.580]   But there's no thou shall not ask a guy out.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.700]   I just don't think it is ideal, and men,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.980]   man, tonight may be your chance.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.380]   You step up, you find Marissa, or whoever she is,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.140]   and you go.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.140]   All right, number three, or number four, I'm sorry.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.460]   Communicate intentionally.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.220]   Communicate intentionally along the path,
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.580]   at the first date, along the dating relationship
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.820]   as it progresses, not intensely, not first date.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.380]   Hey, you know, I'd like to have 17 children,
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.340]   and one of them would be Jeremiah,
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.180]   and the other one would be Nehemiah,
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.660]   and the other one, no, you don't do that, bro.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.220]   That is a recipe for no second date.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.020]   You communicate intentionally and thoughtfully.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.820]   I'd like to take you on a date.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.260]   And then along as the relationship progresses,
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.700]   and you communicate intentionally,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.100]   and here's a big one, ready?
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.740]   Honestly.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.220]   In other words, when that date is finishing up,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.420]   and let me talk to guys and girls.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.660]   The date is finishing up.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.740]   If you don't wanna take her on a second date,
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.660]   you don't say, I'll call you,
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.700]   or I'd like to take you on a second date.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.020]   You don't lie.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.940]   And this is pretty one-on-one stuff,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.500]   but we often, because we're afraid
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500]   of hurting somebody's feelings, it just kinda slips out,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.900]   but you're a follower of Jesus, you don't lie.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.220]   Liars lie.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.980]   You're not a liar.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.220]   You're a follower of Jesus.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.100]   And so if that's not true, then you don't say that.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.620]   And girls, same with you.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.340]   That if he says, I had a great time,
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.860]   I really would like to take you on a second date,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.860]   if you don't want to, or you're not sure, you say that.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.900]   I'd love some time to think about it.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.780]   You don't lie, you don't ghost and say, yeah, great,
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.340]   and then for six months, you're just disappeared.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.480]   You're a follower of Jesus,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.620]   and we put the ways of childhood behind us.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.540]   And so we communicate honestly and intentionally
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.460]   along the way as the relationship progresses,
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.300]   and at some point, it moves from a date to dating.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.000]   You go from noun to verb.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.940]   You're gonna have to have what's called a DTR.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.020]   We can't spend a ton of time here,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.580]   but you're gonna define the relationship,
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.620]   and you're gonna sit down.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.300]   And if along that journey, you, either side,
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.580]   either party begins to go,
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.500]   I just don't think this relationship should continue,
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.920]   you communicate that, and you honor them.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.740]   We're so afraid of hurting someone else's feelings,
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.380]   and we think it's wrong if I hurt someone's feelings.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.300]   If you are sharing the truth and loving them,
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.140]   you are honoring them by not wasting
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.980]   and dragging something on and not suggesting,
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.380]   well, they can't handle the truth.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.940]   No, you honor them, and you share what is true.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.980]   You sit them down at some point,
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.140]   if the relationship progresses,
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.540]   and guys, you can initiate,
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.680]   here's where I see this relationship going.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   I don't know that we're gonna get married,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.300]   but you at least have a lot of the characteristics
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.780]   of someone that I would like to marry,
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.580]   and I'd like to continue pursuing you
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.140]   and make you exclusively my girlfriend.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.060]   And you use the word girlfriend.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.260]   That doesn't matter to you.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.520]   May not matter to every girl,
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.260]   but you're driving clarity into the relationship
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.580]   of who you are, where I see this going,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.740]   and you just honor one another throughout the entire process
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.700]   as the relationship continues.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.500]   The scripture said, we just read it,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.700]   love rejoices in the truth.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.960]   We don't lie.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.620]   Number five, we don't play games.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.520]   Games are for children.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.380]   You're not a child.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.440]   You're a follower of Jesus
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.020]   who's embracing a mature perspective on love,
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.980]   and this is big.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.340]   Nobody in the room probably is like,
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.060]   yeah, I'm a big game player, big gamer.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.460]   Well, in other ways, maybe they do that,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.020]   but as it relates to dating, here's what this looks like.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.860]   And we've been so bombarded
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.060]   by such childish ways of thinking,
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.040]   and we don't even recognize them as childish.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.640]   We recognize them as honestly, how you do it.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.340]   Like if they text you,
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.620]   you wait like 15 minutes before they text back,
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.020]   and if they wait 20 minutes, then you wait 25 minutes,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:00.020]   and you continue to not show too much interest.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.660]   I gotta play a little hard to get.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.220]   I mean, some of you, candidly,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.540]   you've been so brainwashed by the world around us
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.980]   that if he honors you, communicates well,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.620]   is intentional in his words, tells you the truth,
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.540]   responds in a way that's actually consistent
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   with his reality, it's like, oh, oh, man, I don't know.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.500]   That is weird.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.700]   That's weird.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.820]   That's childish.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.760]   That is childish thinking,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.700]   and I'm not here to throw shade.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.860]   I'm here to say, man, you have it.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.460]   You've got what it takes,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   and you're gonna honor one another.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.580]   You're not gonna play games and lead people on.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.300]   The scriptures say, the reason why we play games,
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.860]   play hard to get, don't wanna seem desperate,
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.660]   make them work harder, is control.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.260]   We wanna feel like we're in the driver's seat.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.260]   We're afraid of being vulnerable.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.100]   We're afraid of being hurt.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.660]   We're afraid of rejection, so I wanna have control,
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.320]   self-protection, and 1 Corinthians, the verse we read,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.780]   it says love is not self-focused,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.140]   self-centered, self-protecting
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.900]   at the expense of the other person.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.820]   That you don't play games,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.800]   and you don't tolerate somebody who plays games.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.780]   The saying of, man, you play stupid games,
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.600]   you win stupid prizes, is so appropriate inside of dating
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.900]   that if you embrace worldly ways of thinking,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.580]   it leads to worldly pain,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.180]   and worldly types of relationships.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.100]   And remember, we put those away,
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.140]   the ways of childhood behind us.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.940]   The adage of don't hate the player, hate the game.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.980]   For us, it's, man, you don't date the player,
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.900]   and we don't play games.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.980]   All right, number six.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.420]   Keep sex out of the relationship.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.480]   Keep sex out of the relationship.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.100]   God designed and created sex.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   He's so for it, and he gave this incredible gift
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.740]   for the context of marriage.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.580]   And if that's something that has been a part of your story,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.100]   and like me, have sexual sin in your past,
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.340]   God isn't done with you.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.980]   But when you think about the future,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.260]   and the love story he's gonna write,
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.020]   maybe the love story he is writing,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.520]   you want it to include, man,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.340]   I'm keeping sex saved for marriage.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.900]   I'm prioritizing, or I'm pursuing,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.660]   even if you haven't in the past,
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.180]   going forward, I'm going to.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.500]   Hebrews chapter 13, verse four says,
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.700]   "Marriage should be honored by all.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.740]   "The marriage bed should be kept pure."
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.660]   Here's what's interesting about sex,
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.460]   is we talk about complicating.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.620]   Sex, as I said last week,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.420]   it doesn't make strong relationships.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   Sex makes babies.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.300]   And sex doesn't bring clarity in a dating context.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.420]   It complicates it.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.040]   Because God created this amazing gift
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   to be so powerful that it would be intoxicating,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.460]   like alcohol, or like a substance that intoxicates.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.300]   In other words, the scriptures say in Proverbs chapter five,
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.940]   he's discussing marriage, and he says,
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.060]   "May your fountain always be blessed.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.760]   "May you always rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   "a loving doe, graceful dear.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.500]   "May her breasts satisfy you always."
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.340]   Ready?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.440]   "May you be ever intoxicated with her love.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.460]   "Would you be drunk in her love?"
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.980]   Beyonce didn't come up with drunk in love.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.940]   King Solomon came up with drunk in love.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.060]   And he said, "Will you always be drunk in your wife's love?"
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.180]   That's what I just said.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.500]   That sex, it's intoxicating.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.060]   In other words, the reason it's dangerous
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.700]   in a dating context is it decreases your ability
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.660]   to accurately evaluate, is this the type of person
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.540]   that's gonna make a great mom,
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.460]   that's gonna make a great husband,
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.620]   that's gonna make a great father, that I want to marry?
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.220]   Does this person have the characteristics
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.900]   of someone God says to marry?
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.740]   Or have we just introduced sex?
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.140]   And had we not, this relationship
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.980]   would have broken up at three months.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.660]   But now it's been three years.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.980]   Because we introduced a soul tie.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.820]   What's a soul tie?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.580]   It's God's design for sex would be
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.640]   that it impacts the most intimate, soul-level part of you.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.500]   And we introduced that, and it's like, man, we're connected.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:07.060]   And God, who loves you, wants you to experience
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.460]   all the amazing gift of sex,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.660]   but in the context of marriage.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.060]   It's like this, my friend Trey's gonna come up here,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.740]   and let me show an illustration of what it does.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.260]   I don't know if y'all had in driver's ed
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.220]   something called drunk goggles.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.220]   You remember these?
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.060]   They still exist.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.420]   Maybe some of you had 'em, some of you didn't.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.580]   This simulates the perspective of somebody,
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.540]   hey, give it up for Trey.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.540]   Can we say thank you to Trey?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.700]   Here we go.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.460]   Looking sharp, dapper, all right.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.900]   Trey, I want you to just catch one of these balls,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.960]   no pressure, just without it.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.420]   On, okay, now put the goggles on.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:49.700]   And this simulates someone being intoxicated,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.340]   and now let's see what happens, okay?
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.780]   Good try, okay, that's all right, there we go.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   Man, this is not going, okay, man, it's swinging a miss.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.540]   Okay, there we go.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.140]   My point is, immediately you introduced that,
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.780]   thank you Trey, give it up for Trey, all right.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.640]   Something that was so simple,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.360]   all of a sudden became so complicated
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.660]   and complex and difficult.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.640]   And when you introduce sex into a relationship,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.600]   it doesn't bring clarity, it makes things more complicated.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.920]   Because it's introducing this powerful force that God said,
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.160]   it's intoxicating.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   Like you think, man, you're in love,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.300]   and we're married in God's eyes,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.140]   and I think they're the one.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.400]   No, you just had sex, and they don't have the character
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.820]   that God says to look for.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.540]   But you're under the influence
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.980]   of bringing that into the relationship.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.460]   It's my opinion, this is just my opinion.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.300]   I would delay any sort of physical interaction
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.580]   as long as possible.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.460]   Certainly sex, but I'm talking kissing, making out,
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.420]   and I know, right now I just lost everybody,
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.020]   like, okay, it's official,
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.740]   David does not live in the real world
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.220]   with the rest of us humans,
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.740]   lives in some closet back there,
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.940]   and never comes out, except for on Tuesday nights.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.460]   I have never heard a couple say,
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.880]   you know, our one regret in dating
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.920]   is we just didn't make out enough.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.600]   And you know what's not happening when you're making out?
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.640]   You're not learning anything about them,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.180]   other than like what they just ate for dinner.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   It's just my opinion, I would delay it as long as possible,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.520]   and consider maybe towards marriage, until marriage.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.020]   Okay, I gotta keep moving.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.860]   Number seven.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   Oof, man.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.600]   I wanna be very clear on every word I'm about to say.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.680]   And don't clap.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:50.340]   You don't need deep friendships
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:57.220]   or relationships with someone of the opposite sex.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.880]   Now let me, okay, yeah, I saw that coming.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.340]   Now let me clear it up,
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.880]   let me make sure you hear what I'm saying.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720]   Hey, if you're dating someone,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.600]   you should have a friendship.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   Healthy marriages are built on friendships together.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.280]   What I am saying is very intentional every word.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   You don't need, if you need lots of deep friendships,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:21.400]   if you're a girl with lots of guys of the opposite sex,
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.780]   those are your go-to, those are the closest people you have.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.960]   If you need that, there's something not right there.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.520]   If you're a guy and you need that,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.500]   the closest emotional connections
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.240]   and who you talk to when it's a hard day
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.360]   and who you lean on is not other guys in your life
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.960]   'cause you're a guy, it's other girls in your life.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.560]   I just think it's unwise.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.000]   And so let me be very clear on why I'm saying all of that.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.400]   It introduces potentially a friendationship.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.480]   In other words, man, I've been doing this 12 years
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.320]   at the porch.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.920]   And every relationship between a guy and a girl
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.440]   and somebody's gonna email me, I know,
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.680]   and somebody's gonna come down in front of me like,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.880]   this is Sharla, I'm Steve, we're best friends.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.860]   That's gonna happen.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.360]   In my opinion, I've seen it over and over and over.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.680]   One of the people in that close, hey, we're so close,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.320]   one of the people is like, oh, dude,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.080]   she's straight friend zone, there's nothing.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.440]   And she's over there going, yeah, I'm friend zone,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.160]   but I would love to not be.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   And maybe over time, we're gonna look up and go,
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.200]   man, I've loved you.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.080]   And they've thought that or have some inkling of that.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.080]   It just is unnecessarily playing with fire.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.160]   And you're called as a Christian.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   Remember, we put childish ways behind us
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.680]   to honor the other person
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.760]   and seek to be considerate of the other person.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.840]   And some of us in the room, just if you were honest,
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.400]   man, you have lots of those relationships
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.560]   and emotionally flirtatious relationships,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.880]   emotionally borderline dating relationships,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.120]   and you even have a boyfriend or girlfriend.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.200]   But you turn to those to fill some insecurity
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.960]   or some itch or to scratch something
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.480]   that may reflect something that's not healthy.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.720]   And here's my full disclosure.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.520]   Again, this is my opinion.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.800]   I don't think a guy and girl
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.480]   can have a deep platonic friendship.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.800]   It's just my take, my take, my opinion,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   that a deep, nothing there without something
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.960]   in someone's heart potentially getting misled.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.880]   But you don't need lots of those types of relationships.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.760]   And ladies, here's the other thing.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.480]   Some of the guys in the room, you just may be naive.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.600]   Like I was naive for so many,
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.160]   I look back and I just was an idiot like in college.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.720]   I just, my prefrontal cortex had not developed or something.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.600]   Like I remember I was taking a girl on a date
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.960]   and she was like, oh, I don't think that we can.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.480]   I mean, you're dating my friend.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.520]   And I was like, what?
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.420]   I'm not dating your friend.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.740]   I had no idea what she was talking about.
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.720]   She was like, oh, you know.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.120]   And I was like, no, I have no idea
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.960]   what you're talking about.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.200]   She stepped outside, called this girl,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.740]   and she was like, she's gonna come over, I'm leaving.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.660]   And I was going, I have no idea
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.900]   who is about to come over right now.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.320]   Like zero, zero idea.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.300]   I go outside of my house on the front porch
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.220]   and I look and it's like a movie scene.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.000]   This truck or car pulls up and I just see the car lights
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.580]   and I'm like, I have no idea.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.260]   I mean, I have no idea who's about to come out
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.100]   of this car right now.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.780]   And the silhouette of a person walks up
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.840]   and she was like, yeah, I thought we were dating.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.700]   Which it maybe is equally on her.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.620]   I thought you were interested in putting that out there.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.340]   And sometimes it's just guys, naively,
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.500]   when you're hanging out or you're texting her
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.380]   or you're asking her about her day
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.900]   or you're asking, hey, do you wanna come with me
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.440]   to that Mavs game?
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.080]   She doesn't see it as you're a big Luka fan, me too.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.340]   She sees it as, I think he's asking me on a date
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.620]   or something is going on there.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.780]   And so it may be just a reflection of naivety.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.860]   I just wanna proceed with caution.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.520]   Number eight, invite outside counsel.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.980]   Invite outside counsel.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.420]   Don't isolate the relationship.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.100]   Proverbs 15, 22 says, plans fail for lack of counsel.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.220]   If you have plans to get married,
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.140]   have a successful dating relationship,
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.120]   honor each other and date well.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.480]   Those types of plans fail for lack of counsel
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.980]   or wise counselors.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.400]   But with many advisors, they succeed.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.140]   That you decide, you wanna complicate dating relationships?
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.020]   If you wanna complicate it, then you and her,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.900]   you just go off and as soon as you start dating,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.120]   you only hang out with each other,
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.360]   you're never around other people,
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.140]   you just become the couple that totally isolates.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.840]   But if you wanna have uncomplicated dating,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.360]   you're gonna involve your community group.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.120]   You're gonna involve trusted followers of Jesus
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.960]   in your life.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.440]   You're gonna ask, hey, is there anything that you see
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.480]   or any hesitations you have on this relationship
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.680]   continuing going forward?
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.060]   Do you think I'm in a good place to date?
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.360]   You're gonna ask questions like that.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.960]   You're gonna involve and invite outside counsel
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.060]   to speak into that relationship
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.100]   as a protection for you and for them.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.460]   Proverbs 18, chapter, Proverbs 18, verse one says,
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.220]   "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.620]   "He breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.740]   That if you're the only person who likes your relationship,
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.540]   or you and her, that should be a red flag.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.820]   And you're gonna invite outside counsel.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.820]   All right, number nine, don't be afraid to break up.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:28.160]   If at some point along the dating relationship,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.340]   you find yourself confident
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.780]   this relationship shouldn't move forward,
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.200]   or in a season of doubting and questioning
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.940]   and really wrestling or identifying characteristics
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.340]   that give you pause and concern,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.640]   don't be afraid to end the relationship.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.880]   But when you do, you're gonna honor one another
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.940]   in how you do that.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.500]   You're gonna go in person.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.660]   You don't break up.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.580]   No relationship should be ever broken up
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.940]   through text messaging,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.340]   or any other form of digital communication
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.560]   that includes emojis, okay?
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.580]   You're gonna go in person
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.180]   and do what Philippians chapter two said,
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.940]   which is do nothing out of selfish ambition,
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.620]   but with humility, consider the interests of others
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.300]   more important than yourselves.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.100]   You are going to put the interest
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.340]   in this other person before yourself,
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.740]   and you're gonna communicate,
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.220]   and you're gonna sit them down,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.060]   and you're gonna say, "Thank you for the time
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.900]   "and ways you've invested in this relationship."
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.120]   Or if you're the guy, you're gonna say,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.460]   "Hey, I've really enjoyed," or say whatever's true.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.260]   "Thank you for taking the time
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.820]   "to go on the dates we have been on,
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.400]   "for the relationship that we have had.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:53.460]   "I no longer feel confident moving forward
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:38:00.340]   "and need to break up our relationship."
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.780]   If you're the girl, you're gonna sit them down,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.980]   and you're gonna say whatever's true and honor them.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.360]   "Thank you for taking me on dates
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.480]   "in the way that you have cared for,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.220]   "or the way you have led, communicated,"
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.420]   whatever is true,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.380]   and you're gonna look them in the eye and share,
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.720]   "I, as I've processed, been praying,"
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.460]   maybe you'd share with your community group,
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.340]   "I'm no longer comfortable moving this relationship forward
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.400]   "and need to break up," and you honor them.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.900]   You don't blame God.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.160]   You don't go up to them and be like,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.540]   "Look, I just think God is telling me we need to break up."
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.220]   I mean, think about how many times that's done,
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.500]   and God is in heaven being like, "No, I didn't.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.200]   "No, no, that's just Him.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.900]   "He just doesn't, no."
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.000]   You don't blame God.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.340]   You say, "I'm not comfortable."
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.420]   And the thing that's hard is, as Christians,
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.660]   we don't like hurting people's feelings.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.780]   We're afraid of that, but you're honoring them
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.380]   by saying it would be unloving and dishonoring
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.340]   to continue going forward in a relationship
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.460]   I don't see moving forward.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.460]   And so I'm gonna choose to honor you,
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.680]   and breaking up is hard, but can I just tell you this?
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.180]   If you will actually do the uncomplicated dating,
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.680]   it won't be easy, 'cause breaking up is never easy,
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.280]   but your breakup won't break you,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.100]   because you have protected your sexuality,
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.260]   you have sought to honor them along the way,
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.440]   you've communicated honestly and clearly along that journey.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.280]   You haven't played games.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.520]   Remember, kids play games.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.920]   You're a follower of Jesus.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.040]   You told the truth, and it won't be easy,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.200]   'cause it's never easy,
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.800]   but it is something that God will get you through,
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.460]   and it won't break you, like so many breakups do.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.720]   When you date childishly.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.480]   Finally, we understand, number 10,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.280]   that marriage is ultimately about Jesus.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.760]   If you wanna uncomplicate dating,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.440]   we make it so complicated, and there's so many feels,
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.580]   and what am I thinking, what's he thinking?
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.200]   As it relates to dating as a path to a promise on an altar,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.120]   that's a wedding, to a lifelong pursuit, that's a marriage,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.600]   I understand that at the end of the day,
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.280]   the thing that marriage is about
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.020]   is the same thing life is about,
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.080]   which is Jesus, and knowing Jesus,
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.840]   and being in a covenant relationship.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.520]   I'm gonna explain that in a second with Jesus.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.440]   The marriage, at the end of the day, it's not about you.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.200]   Life is not about you, and finding love,
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.640]   and living happily ever after, and Prince Charming,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.720]   that life, at the end of the day, and it's easy for me,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   and you're married, it's easy for you to say,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.000]   if you wanna have an uncomplicated dating relationship,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.040]   you have gotta be informed
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.080]   that marriage is not about just that marriage.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.640]   It's ultimately a picture
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.480]   that is intended to point us to how God loves
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.280]   and keeps his promises to his people.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.320]   So Paul defines it as.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.720]   In other words, it's like marriage is a picture,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.160]   this is a picture that sits on my desk, it's my wife,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.820]   from the day that we got married.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.880]   And it's a beautiful picture, it's an awesome picture,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.640]   I love this picture,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.440]   but you know what is so much better than this picture?
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:03.720]   Her, like physical, breathing, living, her.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.140]   That a picture is nothing,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.620]   pales in comparison to the person.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.180]   And marriage is meant to be this picture
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.980]   that points to ultimately the person of Christ
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.500]   and his love, his covenant.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.520]   Covenant is a relationship and a entered into bond
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.420]   that ends in death do you part, or only ends in death,
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.080]   or in Christ, eternally, has been set.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.180]   For anyone who believes in Christ.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.180]   In other words, Paul would say in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.340]   he's describing marriage.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.900]   I read these words at every wedding I've ever done.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.700]   And he says something profound about marriage.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.800]   He says, "For this reason," talking about marriage,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.520]   "a man will leave his father and mother
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.140]   "and be united to his wife."
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.380]   And when this happens, something crazy happens.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.640]   "The two become one flesh."
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.480]   Man, how does that happen?
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.040]   You've got two people that yesterday
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.500]   was Sam and Sarah and now is one flesh.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.200]   And then he says, "This is a profound mystery."
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.460]   And up to that point, you're like,
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.700]   "Yeah, man, that is profound."
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.620]   Two becoming one.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.900]   And then he takes a turn.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:22.860]   But I'm talking about Christ and his church.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.580]   Paul is saying, "Hey, the reason God is so passionate
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.840]   "about marriage, the reason marriage and that covenant
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.120]   "and that marriage is a death do us part,
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.320]   "we are in it for the long haul, for better or worse,
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.760]   "that God is so passionate of our understanding of marriage,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.600]   "is because," he says, "it ultimately is meant to point,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.140]   "every human earthly marriage is meant to point
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.140]   "and be a small reflection of the point of marriage,
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.460]   "which is his covenant-keeping love
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.120]   "and relationship with his bride,
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.740]   "which is the body of Christ."
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.220]   Ultimately, it is a picture.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.060]   And it is only in knowing that picture
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.940]   that you understand, hey, just like God never gives up,
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.100]   never abandons, never walks away.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.700]   He run towards me, despite the fact that I don't deserve it.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.940]   That's how I am to love and serve my wife,
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.780]   like Christ has loved and served me, laying down his life.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.460]   That's how I'm to love and serve my wife.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.620]   And she understands that just like Christ loved and served,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.380]   I'm to prioritize and serve and love
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.340]   and put the needs of the other person in front of me.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.040]   And if you don't understand that,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.700]   you've got a childish way of thinking about marriage.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   Fairy tales are fun to read, but they're childish.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   Our understanding of marriage
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.320]   is so much more beautiful and profound.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.800]   And it comes from an understanding that in Christ,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.360]   anyone who's accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.200]   they've trusted in him as the payment on their sin.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.780]   2,000 years, you may have never heard of this before.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.880]   Jesus showed up, God in human flesh.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.160]   He walked on the planet and he went to a cross
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.680]   and he died on behalf of every person who has ever lived,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.960]   every sin in your present,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.800]   everything you don't even wanna ever share
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.400]   with the person that you're dating.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.180]   Everything in your past, everything in your future,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.520]   all of it on a cross, he said,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.960]   "I will be killed and crucified and die
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.860]   so that they will have a payment for their sin."
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.840]   And anyone who trusts in what he did on the cross,
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.640]   not I'm trusting in, man, I'm a good person,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.280]   pay my taxes, try to be nice.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.800]   I give to homeless people from time to time.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.280]   Read my Bible.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.480]   I'm sure God and me are good.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.600]   Nope, wrong answer.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.140]   The Bible says there are no good people.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.680]   You cannot be good enough to reach eternity
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.920]   or to go to heaven, but you don't have to.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.600]   Jesus came and died in your place.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.880]   Everything wrong, everything broken,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.080]   every relational dysfunction,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.720]   every type of sin in this life and in my life paid for.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.600]   And when you trust in him,
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.880]   you are now entered into this eternal,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.360]   unstoppable, unending covenant with Jesus
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.000]   alongside of the people of God,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.680]   that's followers of Jesus.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.840]   Ultimately, what marriage is all about.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:05.380]   If I could boil down and really when it comes to dating,
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.960]   Paul is just expanding what it means to be loving,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.560]   to honor, to care,
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.120]   to understand the value and worth of somebody else.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.160]   And in a culture that is so toxic,
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.240]   as followers of Christ, we know the value of our life
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.280]   and the value of those that we date and are around
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.600]   and every person sitting next to you
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.720]   and every person you'll ever date,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.680]   every person that will be married here.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.300]   My wife and I were buying, I'll close here.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.880]   We were buying a mattress like two years ago.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   We just had gone through and it'd been eight years.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.400]   It just was time to get a mattress.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.800]   And it was COVID and so we decided we were gonna try
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.000]   one of these online, you buy the mattress
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.160]   and they mail it to your doorstep.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.240]   And they come with these guarantees
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.560]   that if you don't like it,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.160]   you can sleep on it for 180 days
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.720]   or extended amount of time.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.560]   And if you don't want it,
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.640]   you can have 100% money back guarantee.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.320]   It's like, man, that feels like no risk, let's do it.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.000]   And we purchased this mattress and like three days in,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.400]   it just was like, man, it's too, it's uncomfortable.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.280]   This is not for us.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.720]   I call up the company and say, hey, we wanna exchange.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.280]   We wanna take you up on the money back guarantee,
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.100]   the refund.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:15.480]   And they said, okay, great, we will refund you
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.920]   and you are only responsible to take the mattress
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.960]   and donate it to a Goodwill
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.800]   or donate it to some sort of secondhand.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.480]   You just have to donate it to somebody.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.040]   And I was going, wait a second,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.400]   you're not even coming to pick up the mattress?
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.680]   We just have to get rid of it?
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.360]   And they were like, yeah, you just have to send us a proof
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.560]   of receipt that you donated it to somewhere.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.800]   And I remember thinking,
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.560]   because we slept on it for three days,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.480]   it's now of so little value to you
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.300]   that it's not even worth your time to pick up
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.800]   or send somebody to get it?
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:57.540]   And what's so sad is so many of us have lived in a world
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.300]   where that's how people think about sexuality.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.500]   Hey, I'm damaged goods.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.220]   I've been slept with or they've slept with somebody
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.760]   or as it relates to sleeping on something
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.100]   or sleeping with something in the same way
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.720]   that that mattress was like, man, it's damaged goods.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.960]   It's not worth anything to us.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.600]   That's how people will think about themselves.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.080]   That's how people will think about other people.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.200]   That's how people treat other people in their life.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.040]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.560]   It's something to sleep with.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.000]   That is such an offense to God
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.040]   who would come and die in your place
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   because the value you have is so great.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.280]   He would lay down his own life.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.320]   You're not damaged goods.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.800]   God is not done with you yet.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.240]   And he wants to uncomplicate your dating life
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.400]   and lead you to experience more and more
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.640]   of what he calls the abundant life
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.720]   and walking in step with him,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.020]   the point of marriage and the point of life.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.080]   Turns out life is not that complicated.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:56.160]   It's to know him and then go make him known
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.240]   to a world that needs it.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.080]   Let me pray.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.200]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.080]   who's carrying shame and guilt.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:12.600]   You would speak tenderly to the heart.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.960]   Whisper against lies.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.520]   Lies that say what defines them is their brokenness.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.200]   Lies like they're damaged goods.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   Lies that they'll never and could never
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   have any type of healthy dating relationship
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.100]   or healthy marriage or healthy future.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.760]   And I pray that you would lead us, God,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.420]   to whatever is the right next step
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.640]   as we think about dating
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.800]   or maybe there's a relationship
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.120]   that we just, we know it's time to end it.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.320]   You'd help us.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.400]   I pray that you'd just unleash men and women in this room,
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.200]   they would just honor one another.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.360]   They'd leave here in nothing else
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.920]   but honor one another and honor God as they do so.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.640]   That that would happen.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.680]   So help us, God, to put the ways of childhood behind us
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.480]   and follow our savior and live out mature love.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.360]   In your name and your glory, amen.
