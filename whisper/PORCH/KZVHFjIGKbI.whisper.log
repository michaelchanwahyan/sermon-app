[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.400]   - Well, what's up Porch fam?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.160]   Y'all, I wanted to let you know how excited I am
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.000]   for tonight's message.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.880]   Y'all, I get the joy in introducing our guest speaker
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.000]   for the night.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.760]   He comes from Southern Seminary as a former professor.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.120]   Y'all, he has his PhD in theology and in the New Testament.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.280]   He's our very own senior director of equipping
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.800]   here at Watermark.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   And lastly, y'all, he was my teacher
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.780]   in the Watermark Institute,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.120]   which is our 10 month discipleship program.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.360]   And a big part of that program is academic level training.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.040]   And so y'all, we are in for a treat, let me tell you.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.200]   So Porch, join me in encouraging and welcoming
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.560]   to the stage, Dr. Orrin Martin.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.960]   - Well, good evening Porch.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   Is that how you say it?
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.700]   Porch.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.640]   Young adults, Porch Live, if you're joining us,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.600]   I'm so glad that you are.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   If you have a Bible,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.000]   please turn in them to Ephesians chapter one.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.880]   If you're new to the Bible,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.320]   that's about two thirds, three quarters of the way in.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.640]   If you get to the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.960]   If you get to Acts, keep going, a couple more books.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.800]   It's Ephesians.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.320]   If you get to like Hebrews and Revelation, that's too far.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.760]   If you have a Bible like mine, it's page 976.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.780]   If you don't, you are out of luck, right?
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.600]   I do want to thank, man, just the Porch team
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.720]   for inviting me to speak.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.320]   I'm so honored.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100]   I can't even tell you how I felt singing
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800]   with you all tonight,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   because I just kept thinking about, Lord,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   if you set on fire, these people here tonight in this room
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.240]   and Porch Live and all those locations,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.860]   if there are people who are fully surrendered
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520]   to Jesus Christ and the life that he provides,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.080]   what could happen?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   Imagine the nations might know and be glad in Christ.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.940]   So it is a joy to be with you all.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.040]   Let me pray for us and we can jump in.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.520]   Lord, in your words, Psalm 121 says,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   when I look and lift my eyes to the hills,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.200]   where does my help come?
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.180]   Maybe there are people in here tonight
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.580]   who when they look around, all they see is hills.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.540]   They can't see past their circumstances.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.300]   They can't see past conflict in their life,
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.420]   brokenness, addictions,
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.420]   depression, anxiety.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.220]   But Lord, thank you for the psalmist who says,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.420]   when we look to the hills, where do we look?
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.600]   We look to you, our God.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.180]   Our help comes from the Lord,
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540]   who is the maker of heaven and earth.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.540]   We look to the one who exists higher than those hills.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.320]   He made those hills by simply speaking words.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.900]   And so we ask you tonight to help us by your power
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.060]   to understand your word.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.200]   Open our eyes to the glories of Christ,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.400]   we pray in his name, amen.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.640]   So a couple of years ago,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.240]   my wife and I went with my cousin and his wife to LA.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.120]   It was an amazing trip because it was free to us.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.160]   It was a totally a gift of my cousin, it was great.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.600]   We went to Hollywood, we went to a Dodgers game.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.480]   I got Mike Trout's autograph.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.600]   He literally walked over to me, signed my baseball.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.480]   It was amazing, my son's have it now.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.180]   It was a once in a lifetime trip.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.380]   One of the days that we went there,
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.240]   my cousin suggested that we go to Six Flags.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.460]   It's like, great, I grew up going to Six Flags in Houston.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720]   Astroworld, maybe, I don't know.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.800]   It's a Travis Scott album now, but anyways.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.460]   So we go to Six Flags and my cousin,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.400]   he gets us VIP access, which I'm like, great,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.840]   whatever that means.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.500]   Basically what it means is you get to ride roller coasters
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.320]   back to back to back to back to back to back to back
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.020]   without waiting in line at all.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.640]   And I was like, I'm in.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.760]   When I was 12, I used to dominate those things.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.200]   So he was like, I got a challenge for you.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.960]   How about we try to ride 10 roller coasters
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.240]   back to back without stopping,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.000]   starting with the hardest, most difficult roller coaster.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.200]   And by the time we get to the easiest,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   it'll be a piece of cake.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.580]   I was like, great, let's do it.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.420]   So here we go.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.240]   This was the challenge.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.540]   First roller coaster.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.280]   It was a good one.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   I must say, I was feeling pretty good.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.640]   My stomach was, it was okay.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   But then we get off that one and we go immediately,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.080]   there's probably a one minute walk to the next one.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.000]   Right to the second one.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600]   And I began to notice a kind of an intensifying feeling
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.820]   right in this area.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.840]   It's called nausea.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.960]   And it just kept building.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.240]   We go to the third one.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.160]   We go to the fourth one.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680]   I mean, in there, just back to back to back.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.600]   There's no time for my body to settle down
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.860]   and kind of get my equilibrium acquainted with the ground.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.560]   And by the fifth roller coaster, I was done.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960]   But there's this little thing in me called pride.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.740]   And I was like, dude, I'm making it to 10.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.900]   So let's go another round.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.400]   So we get on the sixth roller coaster
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.560]   and it was all I could do.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.120]   I was praying like I have never prayed before in my life.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.000]   Lord, help me keep whatever is in me down.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.300]   And you will get all the praise.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.440]   And by God's grace, he did it.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.360]   And I stepped off that roller coaster
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.520]   and immediately I lost everything.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.240]   I mean, people were around us.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.780]   It was awesome.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.700]   It was terrible.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.940]   There was just this overwhelming feeling
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.280]   of I just kept growing and building and growing
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   and building until, well, not good things happened.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.220]   And then we drove home through the hills of Hollywood.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.580]   That was great.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.400]   'Cause we thought being on a roller coaster all over again
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.300]   for the next hour and a half drive.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.700]   And it was an amazing, overwhelming experience.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.460]   Now, what does that have to do with our passage tonight?
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.860]   Well, I want to tell you that our passage tonight
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.360]   should have a similar effect in our lives.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.420]   That there should be an overwhelming feeling
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.960]   when we read through our text,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.060]   that it just continues to build and build and build
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.880]   until it just culminates and erupts in praise.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.580]   When we read this passage,
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.220]   I want us to keep just a couple of things in mind.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.700]   In the original in Greek, it is one unbroken long sentence.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.700]   We're gonna read in Ephesians chapter one,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.020]   verses three through 14.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.080]   That whole, in our Bible, that's two paragraphs.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.140]   That's one sentence.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.380]   And mind you, in Greek, there is no punctuation.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.860]   There's no periods, no commas.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.880]   It's just one long sentence
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.940]   with crazy grammatical things happening.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.900]   If you're into that, come talk to me afterwards.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.660]   Those things kind of bring me joy.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.020]   If you're like into grammar and participles
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.620]   and prepositions and phrases and how it all fits together,
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   it's an amazing experience, kind of like that rollercoaster.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.380]   Twists and turns, and it just builds and builds and builds.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.300]   In fact, I will challenge you,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.980]   maybe when you get home tonight or sometime this week,
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.020]   try to read verses three through 14 in one breath.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.100]   I told them earlier, I was gonna try it.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.180]   I actually practiced it in my office about an hour ago,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.100]   and I almost passed out.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.180]   I made it to verse 13 and I couldn't make it.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.220]   So I'm not even gonna try it here
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.160]   because you don't want me passing out here.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.900]   But just try to read it in one breath.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.180]   It does something.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.640]   You just get overwhelmed with what Paul's saying.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.780]   It's like Paul's walking through a room
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.100]   filled with unending treasures,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.420]   and he's just trying to grasp at words,
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.280]   attempting to describe what he sees.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.580]   There's this treasure and this treasure and this treasure.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.480]   And if that's not enough,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.540]   there's more treasure as he walks us through these verses.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.500]   And what he wants to tell us tonight,
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.560]   and what I think the Lord wants to tell us tonight
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.260]   is there is an all-sufficient,
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.660]   life-possessing God who saves,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.140]   and he is worthy of your life and of your praise.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.540]   The all-sufficient, life-possessing God who saves
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.620]   is worthy of your life and my life,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.020]   and he is worthy of our praise.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.860]   So let's read our passage.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.160]   Ephesians chapter one, beginning in verse three.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.220]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.940]   who has blessed us in Christ
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.380]   with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.180]   Even as he chose us in him
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.820]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.940]   that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.940]   In love he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.560]   according to the purpose of his will,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.380]   to the praise of his glorious grace
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.360]   with which he's blessed us in the beloved.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.860]   In him we have redemption through his blood,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.500]   the forgiveness of our trespasses
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.660]   according to the riches of his grace,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.140]   which he lavished upon us in our wisdom and insight,
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.500]   making known to us the mystery of his will.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.860]   According to the purpose which he set forth
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.620]   in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.180]   to unite all things in him,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.140]   things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.780]   And he ain't done yet.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.300]   And in him we have obtained an inheritance
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.100]   having been predestined according to the purpose of him
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.460]   who works all things according to the counsel of his will.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.100]   So that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.660]   might be to the praise of his glory.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.520]   And in him you also, when you heard the word of truth,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.580]   the gospel of your salvation
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.700]   and believed in him were sealed
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.700]   with the promised Holy Spirit,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.100]   who is the guarantee of our inheritance
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.260]   until we acquire possession of it,
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.400]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.140]   Now, before we jump into tonight's text,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.780]   I want us just to observe a couple of things
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.860]   from these verses.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.980]   One, if you notice the phrase in Christ or in him
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.620]   or through Jesus Christ or in the beloved,
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.260]   you'll notice that in these 12 verses,
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.260]   11 times Paul says in Christ, in Christ, in Christ,
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.300]   in Christ.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.700]   And this is a marker for Paul.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.860]   Actually, if you go to account for the New Testament,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.700]   there are over a hundred times from Jesus,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.540]   think about Jesus in John chapter 15.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.340]   If you abide in me and I in you through Paul,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.700]   all the way through the book of Revelation,
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.780]   there are literally over a hundred times
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.300]   where this phrase in Christ is used.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.860]   And it is used to describe Christians
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.180]   to say, if you are in Christ, you have a new identity.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.300]   You are not defined by your past.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.020]   If you have put your trust and fully surrendered
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.940]   to Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior,
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.140]   you are no longer defined by your past.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.740]   You are now defined by Christ's past,
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.860]   his life, his death, his burial, his resurrection.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.500]   And now he's seated at God's right hand.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.780]   And scripture can say of the Christian, if that's true,
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.900]   and you put your faith in Christ,
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.580]   then you have died with Christ.
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.620]   You've been buried with Christ, Romans 6.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.540]   You've been raised to walk in the new civil limb.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.060]   You've been seated with him in the heavenly place
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.220]   as Ephesians 2 says.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.260]   And so your identity is now in Christ.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.980]   That's who you are.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.020]   And so if you're here tonight and you are not in Christ,
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.900]   if you can say tonight, this is between you and the Lord,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.660]   that's not me, I'm not a Christian.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.580]   I just showed up, I was invited by a friend
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.980]   or I thought I was coming someplace.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.580]   And here I am in this room, God has you here for a purpose.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.140]   It's that purpose is so that you can hear
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.940]   about what it means to be in Christ
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.420]   and to find your life in him.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.820]   But I just want you to consider what's being said tonight.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.580]   Listen in on a conversation that God is having
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.580]   with his people in Christ and consider and respond to him.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.300]   So let's look at our first point.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.380]   Our first point is praise the father
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.300]   from whom all blessings flow.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.380]   You'll see this in verses three through six.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.300]   Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.560]   who has blessed us in Christ.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.420]   Do you see those two statements?
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   God is blessed and God has blessed us, his people.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.720]   And between those two statements
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.820]   lies the glorious gospel of God's infinite grace.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.460]   Listen, he's blessed us in Christ.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.900]   He chose us in Christ.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   He's predestined us for adoption in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.100]   He's working all things according to the counsel
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.940]   of his will in Christ.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.140]   That's what Paul says God is and who he is
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.260]   and what he's done.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.500]   Paul's not giving a command or a wish
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.420]   that God will be blessed.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.660]   He's not saying, oh, I really wish that God was blessed.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.340]   He's not asking a question, is God blessed?
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.080]   No, Paul is declaring what is in fact true.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.120]   God is blessed because as Psalm 36, nine says,
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   he is a fountain of life and in his light do we see light.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   Acts 17 says that God doesn't live
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.680]   in a temple made with hands.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.480]   He's not served by human hands as though he needed anything
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.920]   for he himself gives to mankind life and breath
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.760]   and all things.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.720]   What's Paul saying there in Acts 17?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.480]   He's saying God doesn't receive anything
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   from outside of himself like we do.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.640]   We receive life.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.980]   We need things outside of ourselves for life,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.120]   but God is a fountain of life.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.840]   He doesn't need anything outside of himself,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.720]   but he gives life to his people.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.120]   And the God who has life in himself is the God
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.340]   who has given life from himself.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.400]   Now notice what it does not say.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.360]   It's good to linger and to just pay attention to words.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.080]   It does not say blessed be the porch
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.480]   who has blessed God with every spiritual blessing
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.140]   just as the porch chose God
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.400]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.440]   It doesn't say that.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.080]   It doesn't say that God loved us because we were lovely
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.500]   or because we were sons and daughters
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.440]   or because we were holy and blameless.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.240]   No, if you keep reading in Ephesians in chapter two,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.480]   it says quite the opposite.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.760]   It says that we were dead in our trespasses and sins
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.400]   and that we were by nature, children of wrath
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.880]   because God is holy and righteous.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.200]   He must punish sin.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.080]   He cannot even stand for sin to be in his presence.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.120]   He must punish it.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.680]   But God, Ephesians two says,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.360]   being rich in mercy chose us in Christ
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.100]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.800]   before he made you Christian, he chose you.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.580]   Now notice what Paul focuses on here.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:15.040]   I don't want us to get caught up in there's age old debates
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   on what is the doctrine of election and predestination
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.920]   and what's the relationship between God's sovereignty
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.120]   and our choice and all these kinds of things.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.840]   I wanna bypass those things.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.040]   If you wanna talk to it afterwards, I'd love to.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.840]   Been debated for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.600]   Let me just say, we're not gonna figure it out tonight.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.320]   But Paul does not focus on the logic of election,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   but on its lavishness.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.240]   In love, it says God predestined us,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   not as an angry father, but as a loving father
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   who looked at people who only deserved his just judgment
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   and wrath and he says, I will lavish
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.800]   and pour out my grace on you.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.240]   Friends, people have tried to solve the problems
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   of God's sovereignty and our free will
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.440]   for centuries and centuries and centuries.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   You can go back to Augustine in the fourth century
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.860]   and he's having those debates.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.120]   But let me tell you this,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.520]   if it doesn't cause you and me the fact
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.320]   that what scripture says that he chose us in Christ
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.480]   if that doesn't cause us to sing more wholeheartedly
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.600]   the song of redemption, we've missed it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Election is not for arguments, it is for adoration.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.600]   It's to adore God because of his great love for us.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.920]   So get Paul's point, if you have turned
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.480]   from your sin tonight and you have trusted in Jesus Christ,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.700]   if you have fully surrendered to him,
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.080]   the one who lived the life that you and I couldn't live,
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.920]   the one who died the death that you and I deserve to die
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.040]   because of our sin against God,
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.640]   who paid the penalty that we should have paid
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.280]   and couldn't pay, if we put our trust in Jesus Christ
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.720]   who lived that life, who died that death,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   who paid that penalty and who was raised from the dead
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.940]   as the only righteous one,
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.860]   then what Paul says can be said of you.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.280]   The God, the father who from eternity past
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.340]   has been father of the son is your father.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.520]   Does that amaze you?
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.520]   Martin Luther, the great reformer from the 1500s
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.000]   once said, "The life of Christianity consists
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.560]   "in possessive pronouns."
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.040]   Now, some of you just got lost when I said pronouns.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.960]   You're like, "I haven't seen pronouns since grammar school."
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.520]   And I don't even know what grade that was in.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.820]   Third grade, I don't know.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.600]   But listen to it again, "The life of Christianity
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.880]   "consists of possessive pronouns."
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.680]   It's one thing to say, Luther says, "Christ is a savior."
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.080]   It's quite another thing to say,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.820]   "He is my savior and my Lord."
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.720]   Luther says, "The devil can say the first,
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.860]   "but the true Christian and the true Christian alone
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.000]   "can say the second."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.600]   If you have Christ as your savior,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.680]   then you have God as your father.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.240]   Don't ever take that for granted.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.720]   Maybe you're in here tonight
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.800]   and when you hear the word father, you kind of cringe.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.480]   You get anxious because you didn't have a good father.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.200]   Maybe you're in here tonight like me
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.800]   and you lost your father.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.480]   When I was 18, my father died.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.380]   And he was a wonderful father.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.920]   Though after he died, we found out he lived a double life
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.880]   and he was unfaithful to my mom
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.740]   and died as a result of a sexual sin.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.320]   And so I've had struggles thinking about,
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.200]   is God really who he says he is?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   Can I just tell you tonight that God is who he says he is?
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.760]   And we don't have to look any further
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.920]   than the cross of Christ,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.880]   that God demonstrated his own love toward us
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.040]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.720]   We don't have to look to our circumstances.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.400]   We don't have to look to our bank accounts.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.000]   We don't have to look to our jobs or positions
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.520]   or possessions or anything else to know
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.040]   that God is our father who loves us.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   We look to the cross of Christ
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.520]   and the objective fact of history
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.880]   to tell us that he loves us.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.160]   And for what purpose has God done this work?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.480]   Well, Paul says in verse four,
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.680]   that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.560]   Listen, God did not save us
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.400]   so that we could go on living the same life we always lived.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.600]   No, he saved us so that we would go on to be holy
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.840]   and blameless before him to the praise
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.880]   of his glorious grace.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.680]   Friends, holiness is not an option.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.880]   God chose us before the foundation of the world
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.520]   that we should be more and more and more like Jesus,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.480]   made more and more and more like him.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.160]   And we should understand that the gospel is so powerful
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.000]   that it not only has the power to save us,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   the gospel has the power to save us.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   To save us, the gospel has the power to change us
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   and to transform us, the second Corinthians three says,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.360]   from one degree of glory to another.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.320]   And so I ask you tonight,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.160]   is there an area of your life
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   that is not holy and blameless?
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.520]   Now don't mistake me.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.560]   Holy and blameless does not mean sinless.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.880]   Rather, it means a life that's not holding onto sin.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.480]   It's letting go of sin.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.680]   It's turning from sin and it's surrendering to Jesus Christ.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.440]   And what's the good news for us?
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.080]   The good news for us is that we can repent.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.600]   We can give that sin to Jesus who's taken it on his cross.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.320]   But here's the thing, God the father began our salvation,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   but he did not purchase our salvation.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.960]   That work belongs to the son, which is our second point.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.240]   Praise the son from whom all blessings flow.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:20.920]   We see this in verses seven through 12.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.640]   And we see it all throughout, but specifically those.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.440]   And it's interesting that Paul can't talk about the father
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.320]   without making a beeline for the son.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.680]   Again, listen, he says we are blessed in Christ,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.880]   chosen in Christ, adopted through Christ,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.160]   redeemed in Christ, and we have an inheritance in Christ.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.840]   If God the father is the source of blessing,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.160]   God the son is the center and place of blessing.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.920]   As the father planned our salvation,
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.040]   so the son accomplished and purchased our salvation.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.560]   And how did he do this?
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.120]   Well, Philippians 2 tells us that the son,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.680]   the second person of the Trinity,
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.560]   though he was in the form of God,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.400]   though he was equal with God,
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.000]   did not regard a quality with God, a thing to be grasped,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   a thing to be seized and used for his advantage.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.160]   But what did he do?
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.720]   He humbled himself.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.680]   He made himself nothing by taking the form of a servant
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.240]   and being found in the likeness of man.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.280]   He humbled himself to the point of death,
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   even death on a cross for our salvation.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:37.000]   The eternal son became a servant so that servants to sin
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.500]   could become children of God.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.000]   That's what Paul means when he says
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.080]   that God predestined us for adoption.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.680]   It's a wonderful word.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.080]   Paul used this over and over and over.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.920]   I have a good friend that I taught with for about 10 years
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.200]   who adopted a little boy.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.080]   And Brian was telling me one day
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.360]   that his son, Stephan, ran away from home
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.240]   because he did something wrong.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.640]   He stole some food out of their pantry.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.560]   And he thought because he did that,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.820]   when his parents found out,
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.640]   they would send him away back to the orphanage
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.960]   because that happened to him before.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.400]   And they searched for Stephan for hours and hours and hours.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.040]   And all of a sudden they got a call from the police saying,
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.240]   "We found your son."
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.480]   And they drove to Stephan and Brian, my friend,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.840]   he played football for Alabama.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   He gets down on one knee and he says to Stephan,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.320]   "Stephan, what have you done?"
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.640]   And Stephan says, "Well, I thought that if you found out
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.280]   what I did, you would send me away."
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.840]   And Brian took him and put his hands on his shoulders
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.920]   and said, "Stephan, you need to stop thinking like an orphan
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.440]   and begin thinking like a son."
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.520]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.320]   You see, Stephan in that moment thought
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.440]   that Brian was a different kind of father.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.940]   And he wasn't a good and gracious and heavenly father.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:54.240]   And Christian, that can be true of us, can it?
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.160]   Brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.100]   Sometimes we can live like orphans too.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.920]   Sometimes when we sin and we feel that guilt
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.520]   or we feel that shame, we think,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.480]   "Oh, the worst place for us is to run to our father.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.960]   He'll send me away."
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.460]   And that's not who the father is.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.000]   We know that from the parable of not just the prodigal son,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.200]   but the father who runs after his son,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.600]   who clothes them with his very robe.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.760]   It's what God has done for us in his son.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.400]   He's clothed us with the very righteousness of Christ
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.920]   so that when we feel guilt and shame,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.400]   what's the best thing we can do?
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.720]   We run to our father 'cause he's the only one
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   who can take our sin away and cleanse us
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.040]   from all unrighteousness so that we might have fellowship
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.240]   and walk in the light, as he is in the light.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.000]   And Paul goes on in verse seven and says that in him,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.960]   we have redemption through his blood.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.440]   That word redemption, you see,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.200]   Paul's just like stacking terms,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.760]   predestined, adopted, redeemed.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.360]   Redemption is a word that takes us all the way back
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.200]   to the book of Exodus.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.440]   Do you remember that story when God delivered his people,
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.680]   Israel, from the hands of the Egyptians?
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.840]   They were in slavery and they were enslaved
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.920]   to the Egyptians, forced to do hard labor.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.580]   And God delivered them with an outstretched arm,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.640]   with mighty signs and wonders.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.240]   And you remember how he saved them.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.640]   He saved them by saying, Israel,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.320]   I'm gonna come for judgment.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.720]   I'm gonna judge those who have rebelled against me.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.040]   But if he put the blood of a lamb above your doorpost,
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.960]   if your house is covered with the blood of a lamb,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.200]   you'll be spared and I'll pass over you in judgment
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.360]   and I will save you into the promised land.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.920]   But as great as that reliverance was,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.740]   if you remember the story, by the end of Exodus,
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.600]   I mean, just literally chapters later,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.780]   within days of God delivering them,
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.480]   it didn't solve their problem.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.320]   What were they doing?
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.140]   They were grumbling.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.560]   It culminates in a full-out worship of a golden calf
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.580]   in Exodus 32 and 33, that they're committing idolatry.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.560]   And by the end of Exodus,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.640]   we're shown that the fundamental problem of Israel
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.640]   was not the idolatry and the worship outside of them,
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.100]   but the idolatry and false worship in them.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.500]   And friends, that's our problem too.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.220]   We may not make idols of gold and worship them,
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.360]   but we share our good, our putting our confidence
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.520]   and other things, finding our identity
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.880]   and things outside of our creator and status or power
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.680]   or influence or possessions or pleasure or our abilities
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.080]   or positions or relationships or body image or followers
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.720]   or accomplishments, or you fill in the blank.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.080]   And we miss the fact that we were created
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.520]   to find our life in Him.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   And instead we try to find it elsewhere.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.360]   And like the end of Exodus shows us,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.920]   a better Exodus is needed.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.200]   And that's what Jesus Christ came to do,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.000]   to provide a better redemption.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.960]   Because it's not just the blood of bulls and goats,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.860]   it's the blood of His own body.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.240]   The spotless blood of the Lamb.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.200]   That's why John the Baptist, when he sees him in John,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   he says, "Behold the Lamb of God
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.700]   who takes away the sin of the world."
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.880]   Because Christ was a better Lamb.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.860]   Christ provides a better redemption.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.740]   And God has provided it in Jesus.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.520]   My wife and I watched a documentary
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.400]   on the life of Caliph Browder somewhat recently.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.240]   And if you've never seen it, it's a documentary
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.720]   made by Jay-Z.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.000]   And Browder as a teenager, I think 13, 14,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.720]   was wrongfully accused of stealing a backpack.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.080]   This is just a young teenager, my son's age, 14 years old.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.800]   Gets accused of stealing a backpack,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.140]   gets wrongfully accused, put in prison in Rikers Island,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.160]   which is one of the worst prisons to be put in.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.560]   He was there for three years, during which time
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.360]   he was subjected to horrible abuses.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.800]   Violence, inhumane treatment and isolation.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.000]   This was a kid.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.600]   And when given the chance to plead guilty
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.880]   and reduce his prison time,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   he refused because he knew he was innocent.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   And after three years of fighting the injustice,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.720]   he was finally released.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.120]   And imagine the way that he felt when he was released.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.880]   Imagine the way he felt when he was freed and vindicated.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.900]   Imagine the commitment that he wanted to live differently.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.500]   Unfortunately, he could not escape the horrors
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.800]   that plagued him and he ended up taking his own life.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   Friends, you and I are not wrongfully accused,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.000]   like Khalif Browder was wrongfully accused.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.380]   Each of us has sinned against an infinitely holy God
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.820]   and we are slaves to sin.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.660]   We are in bondage to sin and we deserve his punishment
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.580]   because we're guilty.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.180]   But God has provided a way to change that verdict
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.540]   from guilty to innocent
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.300]   because Jesus has provided a better redemption.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.500]   Colossians 1, 12 tells us that God delivered us, or 13,
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.300]   he delivered us from the domain of darkness
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.740]   and has transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.380]   the righteous one,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.780]   in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.300]   Do you see that?
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.460]   Because God has delivered his people
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.860]   from the domain of sin and Satan and death
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.900]   and transferred him to be in the place of his son.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.620]   Now, when God looks at us, he looks at us as his children.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.700]   And Paul goes on in verse 11 to say
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.700]   that we have obtained an inheritance.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.260]   Do you know who gets an inheritance?
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   Not orphans, but sons and daughters.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:45.380]   Now, imagine that you're an orphan and you owe a great debt
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.380]   and someone steps in and pays that debt off.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.580]   Now, you might be thinking that's great at all,
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.780]   but do you see two problems with that?
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.620]   You may have no debt, but there's two problems.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.120]   You're still an orphan and you ain't got no money.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.060]   Do you see that?
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.260]   Well, that's not what it means to be adopted in Christ.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.460]   Not only has God removed our debt,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.460]   God has deposited in our bank account, so to speak,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.380]   the very righteousness and obedience and life of Christ.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.420]   Not only has our debt been paid,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.580]   but we've been adopted and given an inheritance.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.340]   And I think a great temptation for us as Christians
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.780]   to think is that too little has happened to us
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.500]   by God's grace.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.300]   I mean, we struggle.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.260]   We stumble in many ways, as James says.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.500]   We sin for the thousandth time we sin
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.260]   and we think, will there ever be freedom?
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.380]   And the answer is yes, maybe not in this life,
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.180]   but certainly in the life to come.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.020]   And why?
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.540]   Because God has guaranteed it with an inheritance,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.100]   the inheritance of his son,
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.020]   who the son is by nature,
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.500]   has made us sons and daughters by grace.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:01.620]   We receive his status as son and his riches as son.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:08.260]   But notice finally, God the Father began your salvation.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.100]   God the Son purchased and accomplished your salvation,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.060]   but God the Father and the Son do not apply
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.820]   or perfect your salvation.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.580]   That work belongs to God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.620]   Look with me at verses 13 and 14.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.180]   It says that in him, you also,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.180]   when you heard the word of truth,
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.700]   the gospel of your salvation and believed in him,
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.180]   were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.180]   who is the guarantee of our inheritance
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.860]   until we acquire possession of it
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.780]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.660]   Do you see that?
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.660]   If getting the Father and the Son weren't enough,
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.260]   we get all of God for all of our salvation.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.980]   We enjoy every spiritual blessing by the Spirit.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:51.420]   The presence of the Spirit is connected
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.660]   to the work of the Father and of the Son.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.780]   It's like Jesus said in John chapter 15.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.380]   But when the helper comes, speaking of the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.900]   when Jesus goes away after his death and resurrection
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.640]   and he ascends to the Father,
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.620]   when the helper comes,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.340]   whom I will send to you from the Father
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.020]   and the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father,
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.460]   he will bear witness about me.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.340]   He will guide you in the truth.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.940]   He will take from me, Jesus says,
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.580]   and he will make it known to you.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.620]   And so Jesus says in these chapters
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.980]   that the one who is from the Father and the Son
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.100]   brings us into saving life-giving fellowship
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.500]   with the Father and the Son.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.220]   And that fellowship, that communion
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.540]   flows from the very life of Christ.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.900]   You see, because to have the Spirit
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.380]   and to walk by the Spirit
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.980]   and to be filled with the Spirit
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.580]   is to be filled with the all-satisfying joy
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.020]   and life of Christ,
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.740]   the very all-satisfying life and joy
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.220]   that Jesus prayed to his Father
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.380]   before he was betrayed and crucified.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.900]   He says, "With the glory that we shared from before
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.660]   the foundations of the world," in John 17.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.460]   He brings us into that relationship
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.340]   and we share in that glory and joy.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.500]   And Paul says two things about the Holy Spirit
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.060]   specifically in our passage.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.580]   First, he says that after hearing the gospel and believing,
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.940]   we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.180]   In other words, the indwelling presence
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:26.340]   of the Spirit in our lives is evidence.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.540]   It is the proof of belonging to God.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.580]   Not church involvement.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.780]   If your name is on a membership role,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.820]   that's not proof that you belong to God
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.140]   or any earthly relationship for that matter
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:44.620]   or any one-time decision, as good as those things might be.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.900]   It's the Spirit's presence and work in our lives
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.900]   that assure us that we are children of God.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.940]   So Romans 8 says that the Spirit bears witness
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.580]   with our spirit that what?
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.900]   That we are children of God.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.740]   This is how we know that we abide in him, 1 John 4 says.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.540]   This is how we know that we abide in him
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.500]   and he abides in us, that he's given us his Spirit.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.300]   Do you thank God for the gift of himself
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.940]   in the person of his Spirit?
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:22.820]   He came to intercede, comfort, help, fill,
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:27.340]   gift, guide, lead, and he does all these things
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.100]   that we might know and rest in
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.100]   and proclaim Christ to others.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.180]   And secondly, Paul says that the Holy Spirit is the deposit.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.900]   All right, do you see that in verse 14?
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.580]   He is the guarantee, the deposit,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.100]   the down payment of our inheritance to come
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.820]   until we acquire possession of it.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.100]   All right, the point here is that God is so determined
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.500]   to save you and to save me
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.220]   that he has put down the deposit.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.180]   He has laid down the guarantee of himself
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.740]   that guarantees its completion.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.260]   Maybe you've heard stories like this,
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.020]   but I've heard stories about guys
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.860]   who can't afford engagement rings.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.300]   I won't ask anybody in this room
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.180]   to raise their hands with that to you.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.540]   Maybe you know somebody who can't afford engagement rings,
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.500]   so what do they do?
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:24.060]   Guys are geniuses, so they use things like string,
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.820]   key rings, candy rings as imitations,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.260]   maybe as a down payment to guarantee
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.380]   that something better is coming.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.180]   Now, if you're thinking about doing that,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.460]   can I just say real quickly, don't.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.500]   But you get the point, right?
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.180]   They guarantee, right, it's the down payment,
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.620]   something better is coming.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.020]   It better be, am I right, ladies?
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.620]   Friends, friends, think about this.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.100]   Something better than this world is coming.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.100]   Do you feel the brokenness in your own body,
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.620]   in your own life, inside and outside of you?
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.380]   Something better is coming.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.780]   A whole new world where there will be no more brokenness,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.260]   no more sin, no more pain, no more cancer,
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.700]   no more conflict, no more death, no more grief.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.620]   Scripture tells us in Revelation that when Christ returns
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.180]   to judge the living and the dead,
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.820]   he will make all things new.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.380]   He will wipe away every tear from our eye.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.460]   He will finally destroy sin, Satan, and death,
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.220]   and we will finally enjoy our inheritance,
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.420]   a new world full of joy and life
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.300]   in the presence of our God and Savior,
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.220]   where we will say he will be our God
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.200]   and we will be his people, no more sin.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.260]   So friends, don't settle for cheap substitutes.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.860]   If you're looking for life and joy,
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.380]   don't settle for cheap substitutes.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.380]   Don't look to other places to give you life
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.720]   and reassurance of God's love.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.260]   Don't look to your obedience.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.140]   Don't look to your circumstances.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.340]   Don't look to any temporal blessing.
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.900]   By the work of the Spirit in you,
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.100]   by the presence of the Spirit in you,
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.940]   look to Christ, who guarantees
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.900]   that a new creation's coming,
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.540]   and you have his Spirit to make sure
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.260]   that it will be complete.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.620]   So as we close tonight,
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.540]   let me just encourage you once again, just think.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.300]   Just take a moment and think about the blessings.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.220]   If you place your trust,
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.860]   if you have given your life to Jesus,
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.940]   think about the blessings that are yours
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.620]   in him by his Spirit.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.500]   Every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.780]   chosen in Christ, holy in Christ,
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.740]   adopted in Christ, redeemed in Christ,
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.220]   and guaranteed of a bright future.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:06.580]   And as you think about those blessings
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.780]   that God has given you in Christ by his Spirit,
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.380]   think about why he gave you them.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.020]   Three times Paul says it in that constant refrain,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.300]   "To the praise of his glory,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.660]   "to the praise of his glorious grace,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.140]   "to the praise of his glory."
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.260]   May we live lives to the praise of his glory.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.180]   Let's pray.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:39.820]   Father in heaven, thank you for every spiritual blessing
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.140]   that's ours in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:50.460]   Thank you for doing what we could not do for ourselves.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.140]   Thank you for sending Jesus to live the life
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.240]   that we couldn't live, who obeyed you perfectly,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.460]   that through his life and obedience and righteousness,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.540]   his suffering and death and burial and resurrection,
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.100]   through surrendering, through giving our lives to him,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.580]   through trusting and relying upon him,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.260]   we receive his gift of righteousness.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.260]   We receive his gift of sonships
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.380]   so that we can be children of God,
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:20.260]   sons and daughters who can call you our Father.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:25.300]   And I'm just reminded of Psalm 67,
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.060]   of why you've been gracious to us and why you've blessed us.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:35.780]   Psalm 67 says, "May God be gracious to us and bless us
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.920]   "and make his face to shine upon us."
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.320]   Why?
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.920]   "So that your way may be known on earth,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.880]   "your saving power among the nations."
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.240]   God, may that be true of every young adult
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.460]   in this room tonight and every Porch Live location.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.220]   That we would take time to pause
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.380]   and consider how blessed we are,
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.140]   and that we would not hoard your blessings,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.700]   but we would know you have blessed us
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.580]   so that the nations might know
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.780]   how to find this blessing in Christ.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.180]   I pray that you would stir in our hearts tonight
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.160]   to go to our neighbors and to go to the nations,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.680]   that the nations might find their joy
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.800]   and blessing in Christ.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.480]   So we ask that you would do that work.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.440]   Thank you for your grace.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.180]   Thank you for your blessing.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.320]   Thank you for Christ.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.280]   In his name we pray, amen.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
