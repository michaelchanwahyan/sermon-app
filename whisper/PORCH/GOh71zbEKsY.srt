8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,560
 (congregation cheering)

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,060
 So great to be with you guys tonight.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,520
 If you are with us from the Church Leaders Conference,

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,900
 we wanna welcome you to the porch.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,080
 And if you're a first time guest with us, awesome.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,360
 Hi, mom.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,480
 And so excited.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,400
 Hey, we are in 1 Peter chapter four.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,600
 I'm gonna read verses seven through 11.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,180
 The end of all things is near.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,460
 Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,120
 Above all, love each other deeply

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,080
 because love covers over a multitude of sins.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,280
 Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,000
 Each of you should use whatever gift you have received

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,960
 to serve others as faithful stewards

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 of God's grace in its various forms.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
 If anyone speaks, they should do so

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
 as one who speaks the very words of God.

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,400
 If anyone serves, they should do so

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,080
 with the strength God provides

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
 so that in all things, God may be praised

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,220
 through Jesus Christ.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,800
 To him be the glory and the power

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,800
 forever and ever, amen.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,120
 Well, Father, we thank you just for this eternal truth

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,880
 that you penned through your servant

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,480
 by the power of your Holy Spirit

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,040
 nearly 2,000 years ago

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,160
 that we would read it this evening

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,700
 and be inspired and have a greater understanding

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,360
 of what you desire for our lives,

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,440
 help us to apply it to our lives

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
 and to, as we examine it like James says,

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,760
 that we would make changes to our lives,

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,200
 the things that are inconsistent

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,440
 with your scriptures in our lives,

45
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,120
 that they would be conformed more to your will,

46
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,720
 more to the image and the character of your son Jesus.

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
 So thank you for this privilege.

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,900
 In Christ's name, amen.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,480
 I'll start with this question.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,480
 What is on your bucket list?

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,360
 What are the things on your bucket list?

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,800
 This term bucket list, it comes from

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
 the things that you want to accomplish

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,580
 before you kick the bucket, that is before you die,

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,240
 before you pass on to the next life.

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
 What are the things that you hope to accomplish

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,960
 in this life before then?

58
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,280
 And so I just kind of pulled the audience

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
 through social media.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,240
 If we're friends on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram,

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,720
 I've asked this question.

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,760
 And the way that I asked it, I said,

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,200
 "Hey, if you had found out you had 30 days to live,

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,360
 "what are the things that you'd wanna do

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,120
 "in the next 30 days?"

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
 And so I got a lot of different answers,

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,560
 but there were things like hike the Appalachian Trail.

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,960
 There were some that were spiritual.

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,900
 Some folks said, "Hey, well, I would share the gospel

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,080
 "with everyone I can."

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
 And I appreciate that, but a lot of them

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
 were just like things you wanna accomplish

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,880
 like summit Mount Rainier, get married,

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,200
 write a book, lease a Lamborghini,

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,300
 scuba dive the Great Barrier Reef,

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,160
 run with the bulls in Spain,

77
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 go to Harry Potter World.

78
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
 (congregation cheering)

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,440
 Single for life.

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,880
 (congregation laughing)

81
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,760
 Get a tattoo, meet with the president,

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,400
 go base jumping, and go skydiving.

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
 Skydiving was on mine.

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,920
 That was one of the things that I wanted to do.

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,720
 And I had my closest friend, he knew this.

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,920
 And so for my birthday, he gives me this gift certificate

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
 to go skydiving.

88
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,040
 And so we call, I'm excited,

89
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
 we're making plans to go and do this together.

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,520
 And we call, and I'm on the phone with this lady,

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,080
 and we're scheduling it, and she's kind of walking through

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,920
 some things that I need to know,

93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,480
 and she said, "I just need to make sure you know

94
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,120
 "we have a 240-pound weight limit."

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,380
 And I said, "Oh, that's problematic, I'm 250 pounds."

96
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,740
 And she said, "Oh, okay, well, you know,

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,200
 "there might be something we could do

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,760
 "to make something work."

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,160
 And I was like, when I'm jumping out of airplanes,

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,840
 I'm not trying to make something work, okay?

101
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
 (congregation laughing)

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,960
 No, thank you.

103
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,800
 And so needless to say,

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,500
 that's not on my bucket list anymore, a diet is.

105
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,320
 No, it's not.

106
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
 It's not on my bucket list anymore

107
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
 because here's what happened a few years ago,

108
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,840
 really through that experience,

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,960
 I began to realize that everything on my bucket list

110
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
 was about me.

111
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,980
 That all the things that I had hoped to accomplish

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,360
 before I died were selfish experiences

113
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,200
 and momentary pleasures

114
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,400
 that I would experience in this world

115
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,720
 that it's like I didn't believe

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,000
 that I was gonna live in some redeemed version

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
 of this world,

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,680
 that God wasn't going to ultimately bring heaven here

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
 and that I would exist here forever.

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,840
 I don't need to see Thailand today,

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,080
 I'll see one day a glorified, redeemed version of Thailand.

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
 That I'm His.

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
 And this bucket list idea,

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
 it's really a pagan idea.

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,440
 It's the idea of someone who does not believe

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,720
 that they're going to live forever with Christ.

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360
 And so realizing this,

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,640
 it allows us to focus on what is a real bucket list.

129
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,120
 Peter's going to tell us this evening

130
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,960
 that the end of all things is near

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,600
 and the only thing that lasts forever is God,

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
 His word and the souls of people.

133
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,480
 And so we need to prioritize

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,400
 that which is most important to God.

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
 Peter is going to tell us,

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 here's what really matters.

137
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
 You're running out of time.

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,560
 You might have a next day,

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
 but one day, sooner than you could ever imagine,

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,760
 you're going to have a last day.

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,720
 And the only thing that's promised to you,

142
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,240
 the only thing you truly possess is now.

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,440
 That's the only thing you really have now.

144
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,920
 Tomorrow or two minutes from now is not promised to us.

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,200
 One of the persons that responded

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,720
 to my social media questions said,

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
 I'd give everything away.

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,000
 And that's most in line

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
 with what Peter's going to show us this evening.

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
 And so we're talking about what it means

151
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,600
 to live like time is running out.

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,840
 Really, that is the bucket list that Christians should have.

153
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,040
 Peter's going to present it to us here in chapter four.

154
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,160
 And so my points as I move through these verses

155
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,600
 are pray, love, give.

156
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
 Pray, love, give.

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,880
 I know that sounds like a Julia Roberts movie,

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,560
 but it's not because eat, pray, love.

159
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
 If you've seen it,

160
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,880
 it's this really self-actualization,

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,960
 self-fulfilling, selfish-seeking movie.

162
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,040
 Hey, I want to go and find myself.

163
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
 We don't need to find ourselves.

164
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,400
 God already found us.

165
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
 He has plans for us,

166
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,720
 and we don't use our time on earth

167
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,480
 to fulfill momentary pleasures for us.

168
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
 We use it to seek out his will and do it.

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,200
 And so 1 Peter 4, verse seven.

170
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,840
 The end of all things is near.

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now, if you read that, right off the bat,

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,320
 Peter may lose credibility with you

173
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,960
 'cause you're like, man, he wrote this 1,900 years ago.

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
 Like, what do you mean the end of all things is near?

175
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
 It's over a thousand years later, like how?

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,520
 And so it's like two days ago, I was getting a haircut.

177
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,560
 My wife dropped me off with some of the kids,

178
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,760
 and they were waiting,

179
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
 and I finished getting the haircut,

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,180
 and then we were sitting there,

181
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,360
 and they were kind of looking out into the parking lot

182
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,080
 as she was gonna come back and pick us up,

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
 and they said, "Daddy, we should go over there

184
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
 "to Trader Joe's.

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
 "Let's go to Trader Joe's and get a snack."

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,720
 And I said, "I can't.

187
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
 "We can't do that.

188
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,360
 "Mommy will come back any minute, and we need to be here."

189
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,400
 And as 10 minutes go by,

190
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,560
 they showed me that we could've went to Trader Joe's,

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,620
 basically saying, "You're wrong when you said

192
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,840
 "mommy could come back at any minute,"

193
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
 but the truth is I wasn't.

194
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,520
 I wasn't wrong.

195
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
 She could come back at any minute,

196
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,760
 and when she came back, I needed to be there

197
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,360
 so she would pick us up and give us a ride home.

198
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,200
 And when she came back two minutes later, we saw that,

199
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,960
 and so right now, the sky could crack open,

200
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
 clouds roll back like a scroll,

201
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,280
 there's Christ on a white horse coming for his church.

202
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,160
 It could happen right now, tonight, tomorrow,

203
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,760
 while you sleep, any moment, Peter's saying.

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,300
 And so he tells us then,

205
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,760
 "Therefore, be alert and of sober mind that you may pray."

206
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,040
 And so the summary is the end is near.

207
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,000
 Jesus is coming back at any moment,

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,680
 so pray with a sober mind.

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,840
 It's the word, a sane mind, the opposite of insanity.

210
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,480
 Pray in your right mind.

211
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,720
 Have you ever seen, like if you've been in Times Square

212
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,240
 or maybe even downtown, those people with the sandwich boards

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 that say, "The end is near, the end is near,"

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,400
 and you walk by those people and you're like, "Crazy."

215
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,880
 Peter's saying, "Ah, what if

216
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,500
 "they're the most sane people out there?

217
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,000
 "At least their perspective is correct."

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,800
 Like you may not have lived your moments today

219
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,780
 like the end is near, and he's admonishing us

220
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,800
 through God's word that that is how we are actually to live.

221
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,720
 Time is running out, and so with a sane mind and sobriety,

222
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,560
 pray, my first point, pray with perspective.

223
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,620
 Pray with a right perspective.

224
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,920
 Praying for the right things comes from praying

225
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,580
 with this right perspective that the end is near.

226
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,380
 When someone finds out, I've learned this

227
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,320
 in vocational ministry, when someone finds out

228
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,240
 they are dying, they only have a short time

229
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
 on earth to live, they sober up.

230
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,740
 It's all of a sudden priorities start to just kind of

231
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,020
 fall in place, and the worldly desires that we chase,

232
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,200
 those kind of fade, and it's like, okay,

233
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
 who do I need to show that I love, and what do I need to do?

234
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,980
 And when I talk to God, it's just like it's he and I.

235
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,400
 It's tremendous sobriety, and so it's realizing,

236
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
 we're realizing that time is running out,

237
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
 that we're on this clock that's ticking down,

238
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
 and that any minute, not just like this hourglass,

239
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,200
 that any minute we could realize that Jesus is coming back

240
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,960
 as lives, like this is more like the earth,

241
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,200
 and it's like the granules of sand in there,

242
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,480
 those are human lives passing from one life to the next,

243
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
 from the life to the next, that started

244
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,400
 at the beginning of the beginning,

245
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,120
 and that's the motion that God,

246
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
 that's the clock that God put into motion,

247
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
 and we're existing in that, and one day,

248
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,300
 it's gonna be done, it's gonna run out.

249
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,200
 And so this perspective affects two things in praying.

250
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,840
 I give them to you, frequency and content.

251
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,760
 Frequency is just this idea that when we're in trouble,

252
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,800
 we pray more, when we realize that time is running out,

253
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,020
 we pray more, we pray with greater frequency.

254
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,320
 Some might call these game day prayers, right?

255
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
 Like you're facing, you want a promotion,

256
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,480
 Lord, please give me a promotion,

257
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
 you're in trouble at work, you got written up,

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,920
 Lord, please help me to survive this.

259
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,800
 God, I pray she's not pregnant.

260
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,020
 God, I pray I'm not pregnant, right?

261
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,240
 These are these game day emergency prayers,

262
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,880
 you just got a diagnosis that you don't like, right?

263
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,600
 And so you start to pray, it's when you go

264
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,880
 and you pray more.

265
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
 You're on the airplane, and you hit rough air,

266
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
 the pilot calls it, we know it as turbulence.

267
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 It's like, oh, whoa, hey God, it's me again,

268
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
 hadn't talked to you since last time I was on a plane,

269
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
 but would you please safely carry us to the ground?

270
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,200
 And you're praying with great focus, with great sobriety.

271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,700
 The other thing that changes with this understanding

272
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,940
 is content, the contents of our prayers.

273
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,120
 The new believer prays for one thing,

274
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,700
 the new convert prays for one thing,

275
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,780
 whatever they want.

276
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,720
 That's okay, that's you.

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,200
 That's all right, as long as you're asking God,

278
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,560
 God, show me what you want, I'm gonna pray for what I want,

279
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,400
 I'm asking what you want, you know, it's just honest,

280
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,820
 God wants a relationship with you,

281
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,060
 and so as you pray for you what you want,

282
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,800
 you're building a relationship with him,

283
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,680
 but as you mature, your prayers turn outward.

284
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,740
 You begin to see that there's others around you,

285
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,680
 there's this world that God has you existing in,

286
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
 that there's things that he wants to accomplish

287
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,160
 through you in this world.

288
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,180
 So what's the difference between worrying and praying?

289
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,040
 What's the difference between worrying and praying,

290
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,400
 being given to worry and given to prayer?

291
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,580
 The difference is one is a productive conversation

292
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,480
 and the other is a faithless waste of time.

293
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,000
 Worrying is a faithless waste of time,

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,360
 while praying is a productive conversation with God.

295
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,240
 The only difference between worrying and praying

296
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,840
 is one has another person there listening,

297
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,320
 it's an act of faith.

298
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,000
 And here's the gift that I have for you worriers,

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,380
 is it's so easy to turn your worries to prayers.

300
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,420
 Like you can sit there in this unproductive,

301
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,760
 faithless waste of time, and you can worry, worry, worry,

302
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,120
 worry, worry, or you can say, God,

303
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
 now I'm not worrying but I'm talking to you.

304
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
 One is I'm gonna be single forever and ever and ever

305
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
 and ever, and the other is God,

306
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,260
 please help me to get married.

307
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,400
 One is I really want the job,

308
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
 I'm never gonna have a job,

309
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
 and how am I gonna pay for the rent,

310
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,640
 and oh my goodness, what's gonna happen?

311
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,480
 The other is God, can you handle that?

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,960
 And they look very similar, one's worrying, one's praying.

313
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,320
 You have the power as a follower of Jesus Christ

314
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,160
 with his Holy Spirit to turn worries into prayers.

315
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
 And so this clock, it's winding down

316
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
 and we must pray these prayers like we're at war.

317
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,940
 That's Peter's writing this at wartime.

318
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,640
 Christians are being persecuted.

319
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,760
 I've heard it said with this illustration

320
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,560
 that often our prayers are like

321
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,680
 we're calling for room service.

322
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,500
 We're dialing up God according to our preferences,

323
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,760
 whatever we feel like, and we call in and say,

324
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,960
 hey, would you please send me this?

325
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,800
 Would you move me here?

326
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,480
 Would you come and fluff my pillow

327
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
 and I'd like chocolate cake?

328
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,720
 And whatever we want, would you do this like room service?

329
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,840
 And in reality, prayer is much more like a walkie talkie

330
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,960
 with our commander in chief as we're moving into battle.

331
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,200
 God, I'm moving towards this Starbucks.

332
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,720
 What do you have for me to do?

333
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,840
 Who's in here?

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,720
 What divine appointments do you have

335
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
 for me to move into?

336
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,560
 Whose lives do you want me to change?

337
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,840
 God, I'm moving, walking through my apartment complex

338
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
 and I see my neighbor.

339
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
 How would you like me to engage them?

340
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,260
 Where am I going?

341
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,100
 What am I doing?

342
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,000
 What do you have for me today?

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
 God, as I move into work and I'm walking past this cube,

344
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,280
 who would you like me to engage?

345
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,240
 What do you want me to do?

346
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,320
 What conversations do you want me to have?

347
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,660
 That's wartime prayers.

348
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,880
 That's prayers with a sober mind.

349
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,680
 These are the prayers of a sane person.

350
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,320
 Verse eight, above all, he says,

351
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,360
 love each other deeply.

352
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,320
 It's the Greek ecthenos.

353
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,680
 Love each other deeply, that word deeply,

354
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,160
 it's the word that we use is stretched out like an athlete,

355
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,920
 like an athlete crossing the finish line,

356
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,160
 stretches out to cross that finish line

357
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,000
 or stretches muscles in a way

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,080
 that are uncomfortably productive,

359
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,960
 that you would stretch out yourself and love others

360
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,480
 in a way that is more than you're comfortable

361
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,580
 doing naturally.

362
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,920
 Because love covers over a multitude of sins.

363
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,140
 It is not, it's not saying that it is blind to faults,

364
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,000
 but it sees faults and accepts the faults of others.

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
 It's not in ignoring those faults,

366
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,760
 which is unloving.

367
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,080
 It's saying that's not right, but I still love you.

368
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,720
 Not because I love you, I'll call that right.

369
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
 There's a difference.

370
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
 It's not saying, hey, because I love you

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,480
 and love covers over a multitude of sins,

372
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,520
 I won't acknowledge that that's sin.

373
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,840
 It's saying because I love you,

374
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,720
 I'm going to acknowledge your sin

375
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,420
 and love you in spite of your sin.

376
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,000
 I'm going to take you in as a sinner.

377
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
 (congregation laughing)

378
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,720
 Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.

379
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,800
 Without grumbling, we show hospitality.

380
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,860
 If you want to practice this, get a truck.

381
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,000
 (congregation laughing)

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
 Because people will call you

383
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,760
 and they will offer you a six-pack and pizza

384
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,480
 to help you move, ask you to help them move,

385
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,160
 and you will have lots of opportunities

386
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,220
 to serve without grumbling.

387
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,440
 That we invite people, and keep in mind

388
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,400
 when Peter wrote this that Christians

389
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,960
 were being persecuted in such a way

390
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,880
 that they needed to rely on the love

391
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,920
 of each other for survival.

392
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,560
 Like they would have to hide in each other's houses

393
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,080
 and places and take strangers in and feed them

394
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,600
 so that they wouldn't be killed or persecuted.

395
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,000
 And this is the world that we live in now.

396
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,680
 This kind of love is dying, that we would show

397
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
 this kind of love to one another.

398
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,020
 And so my second point is we're to love without limits.

399
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,280
 Peter is telling us there should be no limits to your love.

400
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,960
 And this happened in the first and second century.

401
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,380
 In fact, Tertullian wrote this in the second century.

402
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,040
 In his defense of Christians, he's talking about

403
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
 how pagans had taken notice to the way

404
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
 Christians love each other.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,940
 He wrote, "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies,

406
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,140
 "in the eyes of our enemies, is our loving kindness.

407
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,140
 "Only look," they say, "how they love one another."

408
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,800
 And the love in this text, it's the word agapeo.

409
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,920
 It's the verb form of the noun most of you have heard of,

410
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,620
 agape, agape love.

411
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,380
 It is a self-sacrificing, it's a word,

412
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,740
 the closest English word we have for it is charity.

413
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,420
 It's giving and expecting nothing in return.

414
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,880
 It's that kind of love, that you would extend love

415
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,960
 to someone and expect them to do nothing for you in return.

416
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,860
 Agape, and so maybe you've heard of that word, agape, before,

417
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,520
 but I'd love to teach you something about that word.

418
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,820
 Did you know that that word did not exist

419
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,860
 until someone had to describe the love

420
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,920
 that God followers had for each other?

421
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,060
 Okay, 800 years before Christ shows up on the scene,

422
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,580
 Homer, we see him introduce the word agapeo.

423
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,940
 And that's this love that a mother would have for her child.

424
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,140
 It's a sacrificing, hey, I'll do anything for you

425
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,960
 kind of love, I'll compromise my comforts for you

426
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,960
 kind of love, take my life for your life kind of love.

427
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,220
 And then when these Christians, about 100 years around

428
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,120
 when Jesus is showing up on the scene,

429
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,620
 God followers, they have to describe them,

430
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,580
 and they don't have a word.

431
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,020
 They're like, the way that they love each other,

432
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,980
 we don't have a word for that.

433
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,920
 There's no word for the way that these people

434
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,680
 who claim to know the creator of the universe,

435
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,040
 we can't describe the love that they have for each other.

436
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,860
 And then in the Greek Bible, we see the word agape show up.

437
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,220
 They invented a word.

438
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,760
 A word was invented to describe

439
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,700
 how Christians love each other.

440
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,160
 It's like, what are we doing?

441
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,300
 We don't know what that's called.

442
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,060
 See, the marketing plan for Christianity,

443
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,360
 it's really simple.

444
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,620
 It's people showing extreme, out of this world,

445
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,420
 kindness to others as they carry forth the gospel.

446
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,840
 And this is the breakdown of Christianity.

447
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,820
 It's the misunderstanding of this.

448
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,260
 It's the neglecting of this command.

449
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,420
 Like, you can just think about it

450
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,480
 in the context of how we date.

451
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,140
 That we take this idea of love

452
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,220
 and we make it this extreme emotional thing.

453
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,380
 We say, I love you.

454
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,700
 And what we really mean is the most selfish,

455
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,020
 fulfilling thing that I can do

456
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,820
 is express these feelings of emotion towards you

457
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,940
 and take from you everything I can that validates myself.

458
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,220
 There's nothing selfless about that.

459
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,000
 Because what would this self-sacrificing love do?

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
 It would be like, hey, I love you,

461
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,380
 and so I'm not going to do

462
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,420
 what I feel like doing towards you.

463
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,300
 Rather, I'm going to discipline myself

464
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,060
 in an act of dying to my flesh

465
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,340
 for the sake of verb, loving, serving, caring for,

466
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,340
 helping you without complaining, without rumbling.

467
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:15,020
 I remember when Monica and I got married,

468
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,860
 she had inherited, through a breakup with an ex-boyfriend,

469
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,180
 she had gotten a Rottweiler in the split, okay?

470
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,220
 So they had purchased a dog together.

471
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,260
 And they broke up and she got the dog

472
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,340
 and then we dated and ultimately got married

473
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,780
 and her parents got the dog.

474
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,740
 And we eventually bought a house, a beautiful home.

475
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,580
 I was really excited about it.

476
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,500
 I wasn't in ministry at the time

477
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,020
 and we kind of bought this house

478
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,540
 that was our dream house at the time

479
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,780
 and it had these gorgeous hardwood floors that I loved.

480
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,620
 And Lexus is the Rottweiler's name

481
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,940
 and Monica's parents would come and stay with us.

482
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,500
 And year two of marriage was a rough one

483
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,060
 and her parents would come and stay with us

484
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,980
 and they would bring Lexus

485
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,540
 and Lexus didn't like to be outside,

486
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,020
 so Lexus would sleep inside.

487
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,660
 And Lexus didn't like to get her toenails cut.

488
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,140
 And so Lexus had these gnarly long toenails

489
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,860
 and she would run all over my hardwood floors.

490
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,900
 And she'd try to stop around the corners

491
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,340
 and she'd just slide into the refrigerator

492
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,740
 and I would just like, oh,

493
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,860
 I'd cringe at the sound of her claws

494
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,820
 digging into my brand new hand-scraped hardwood floors.

495
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,120
 And one day we had just gotten into it, her and I,

496
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,260
 which was very common for the second year of marriage.

497
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,540
 We'd been married 12 years over a decade since then

498
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,500
 by God's grace.

499
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,900
 And on this particular day, we were just into it

500
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
 and I'm like, your parents, I mean, they just,

501
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,540
 this is not fair.

502
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,340
 I felt so justified in my frustration with this dog.

503
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,820
 And I left the house and I called this guy

504
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,780
 that was discipling me.

505
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,060
 I was a brand new Christian

506
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,680
 and this guy was pouring into my life.

507
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,900
 And I'm telling him, the full vent to my anger

508
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,900
 towards her parents and this dog

509
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,980
 that's the ex-boyfriend's dog

510
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,820
 who doesn't like his toenails cut

511
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,100
 and eats Cheerios and milk for breakfast,

512
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,540
 which is a whole nother story.

513
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,500
 And I'm just saying, I was scratching up all my hardwoods

514
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,820
 and he just says, do you love your in-laws?

515
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,140
 I remember I'm walking through Home Depot,

516
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,060
 just full vent to the anger,

517
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,540
 didn't have anywhere else to go, Home Depot.

518
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,260
 [congregation laughing]

519
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,220
 And says, do you love your in-laws?

520
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
 What do you mean?

521
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,540
 Of course, yes, I love my in-laws.

522
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,980
 She said, okay, because it sounds like

523
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,460
 you love your hardwoods more.

524
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,860
 I'm like, shut up.

525
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,100
 [congregation laughing]

526
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,420
 Why would you say such a terrible thing?

527
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,140
 And he's just saying, he's saying this verse,

528
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,140
 love covers a multitude of sins, of wrongdoings.

529
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,940
 It overlooks offenses, not in an enabling kind of way,

530
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,300
 but I'm gonna love you in spite of kind of way.

531
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,760
 I think probably the greatest journey

532
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,540
 that you could start on tonight

533
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,900
 outside of following Jesus,

534
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,860
 or becoming a follower of Jesus,

535
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,820
 would be loving people in the name of Jesus.

536
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,540
 It's the greatest adventure available to us

537
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,380
 on the planet Earth.

538
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,260
 It's really fun.

539
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,660
 Like Monica and I, we have a blast just listening

540
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,660
 to the needs of others and secretly meeting those needs.

541
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,060
 It's a blast.

542
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,100
 I mean, just hearing folks, like listening,

543
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,380
 like leaning into, what did you say they needed?

544
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,420
 Oh, they want, but they can't afford what?

545
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,940
 Okay, that's interesting, we'll pray for them.

546
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,620
 [laughing]

547
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,780
 It's like we're Batman.

548
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,940
 I mean, that's what it feels like.

549
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,220
 You know, we're vigilantes taking things in our own hands,

550
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,100
 anonymously meeting the needs of others.

551
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,060
 This is what Christians do.

552
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,900
 It's what we can do.

553
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,380
 You can start doing that tonight.

554
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,060
 Just listening to the needs of others and moving in

555
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,660
 and loving them in spite of their wrongs

556
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,180
 or how irresponsible they've been.

557
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,140
 You can just care for them and love them

558
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,820
 and show Christ's grace to them

559
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,740
 because the greatest example of this kind of love

560
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,340
 that we have is the gospel.

561
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,700
 It is that Christ covers, literally atones for,

562
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,900
 covers our sins, loves us in spite of our sins.

563
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,740
 First John 4:10 says, "This is love, not that we loved God,

564
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,040
 "but that he loved us and sent his son, Jesus Christ,

565
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,260
 "as an atoning or covering sacrifice for our sins."

566
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,140
 First John 3:16 says, "This is how we know what love is.

567
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,060
 "Jesus Christ laid down his life for us

568
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
 "and we ought to lay down our lives

569
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,860
 "for our brothers and sisters."

570
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,900
 And so this text is saying that we're to do this

571
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,740
 without grumbling and complaining,

572
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,660
 to be sensitive to the needs of others,

573
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,240
 to use the gift of hospitality.

574
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,580
 Some of you have that gift,

575
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,100
 that you would use it without grumbling and serve the body.

576
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,700
 My friend Katie, who served at the porch here,

577
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,560
 she literally purchased a house

578
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,660
 and she's this amazing cook.

579
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,540
 Like she loved to cook and bake

580
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,020
 and she would throw these huge epic parties

581
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,620
 and she'd invite homeless people in and porch volunteers in

582
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,220
 and friends from the neighborhood in

583
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,020
 and strangers from the neighborhood in

584
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,820
 and her house would just be full of people

585
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,700
 that she would feed and care and love

586
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,020
 and share the gospel with.

587
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,340
 It's such an incredible use of the gift of hospitality

588
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,460
 that the kingdom would move forward on that.

589
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,340
 Verse 10, "Each of you should use

590
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,500
 "whatever gifts you have received to serve others

591
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,420
 "as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."

592
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,060
 I've got three children, Presley 10, Finley 8, Weston 4

593
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,300
 and my 10 and eight year old, I talk to them all the time.

594
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,020
 I'm like, "Hey, your gifts," in their language,

595
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,860
 they're believers, they've trusted in Christ

596
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,700
 and so I talk to them, "Hey, your gifts,

597
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,620
 "they're like superpowers."

598
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,420
 And they're like, "Well, what do you mean?"

599
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,420
 I'm like, "Man, you can talk to somebody today.

600
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,080
 "You can encourage them, you can serve them

601
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,520
 "in a way that will literally change their life,

602
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,340
 "change their day, change their countenance,

603
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,940
 "soften their heart, it will remove hate

604
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,420
 "and replace it with love.

605
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,320
 "Like you can change a human being

606
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,020
 "by the way you use these gifts.

607
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,100
 "That's so much more valuable than being able to fly

608
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,100
 "or see through things, that you can talk to someone,

609
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,040
 "partnered with God and change their eternal destination.

610
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,360
 "They will pass from going to hell to going to heaven

611
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,980
 "through you, God, working through you using your gifts."

612
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,580
 They're like superpowers.

613
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:42,540
 If anyone speaks, they should do so

614
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,800
 as one who speaks the very words of God.

615
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,700
 If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength

616
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,620
 God provides so that in all things,

617
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,140
 God may be praised through Jesus Christ.

618
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 To him be the glory and the power forever and ever, amen.

619
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 Saint, we're steward of God's gifts.

620
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,140
 He breaks them down into two categories,

621
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,860
 speaking and serving, words and actions.

622
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,480
 These are the ways that we can express gifts

623
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,140
 through words and actions.

624
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,760
 And he's saying this word here, it's the word steward.

625
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,180
 It's like someone who is responsible

626
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,960
 for like taking care of a house.

627
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,900
 The house and the possessions in the house aren't theirs,

628
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,340
 but they take care of them as though they were theirs.

629
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,760
 They steward them.

630
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,740
 It's like this, it's like FedEx at Christmas.

631
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,980
 You send gifts through FedEx at Christmas.

632
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,780
 They steward those gifts.

633
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,700
 They take them to where they belong.

634
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,180
 You would be outraged if they sat there

635
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,780
 and they just started collecting them and open them in.

636
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,820
 The person driving the FedEx truck just kind of like,

637
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,380
 "Look at all my gifts," and starts tearing into them

638
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,340
 like they're his gifts.

639
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,820
 He'd be like, "No, those aren't your gifts.

640
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,460
 "I gave you those to steward."

641
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,580
 So did God.

642
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,420
 He gave you gifts to steward.

643
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,540
 They weren't for you to try to make as much money

644
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,180
 as you could possibly have and pursue as much pleasure

645
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,900
 as you could possibly get and buy as many things

646
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,740
 as you can collect.

647
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,620
 That's not why he gave you those gifts.

648
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,940
 You're a steward of those gifts.

649
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,020
 And so glorify, my third point, glorify God with your gifts.

650
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,340
 It says in verse 10, "You are a steward of God's grace

651
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,980
 "in its various forms, both speaking and serving,

652
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,980
 "talking about speaking, words of encouragement."

653
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,420
 It says it's like being the literal mouthpiece of God.

654
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,980
 That when Christ wants to encourage someone with words,

655
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,860
 he often uses Christ's followers, his followers,

656
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,340
 to speak encouraging words to others.

657
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,380
 There's power in this that you may not even been aware of.

658
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,060
 I think of my grandmother.

659
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:09,100
 When I was growing up, she would look at me

660
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,500
 with the most sincerity and say,

661
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,220
 "How's my mighty man of God?"

662
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,780
 It was just sweet, you know, when you're four and six,

663
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,420
 and she would always see me, we'd go to her house on Sundays,

664
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,260
 she'd say, "How's my mighty man of God?"

665
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,060
 And I can't, like, those words,

666
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,020
 like, they put me on a trajectory

667
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,460
 that was really powerful.

668
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,540
 I'm not trying to get weird on you or anything,

669
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,620
 but it just seemed like that they were shifting me.

670
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,500
 And so when I'm 16 and I start getting high,

671
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,940
 you know, start smoking weed, and then I start partying,

672
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,460
 and then I start entering into relationships

673
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,540
 and doing things that I know I shouldn't be doing,

674
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,300
 and we go to her house and I see her,

675
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,720
 and she'd say, "How's my mighty man of God?

676
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,440
 "How's my mighty man of God?"

677
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,040
 Like, it's fine when I'm six,

678
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,200
 but when I'm 16 and I'm 18,

679
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,000
 I know I'm not walking with the Lord,

680
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
 and she's just sitting there speaking this over me,

681
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,080
 "How's my mighty man of God?"

682
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,360
 And it's like, it's like it was,

683
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,160
 that was the beginning of a calling in the ministry.

684
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
 I know that's weird, but it's like,

685
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,380
 that's what God was doing through my frail grandmother.

686
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,920
 Using those words, "How's my mighty man of God?"

687
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,340
 That's the gift of encouragement.

688
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,300
 You know people that you love to be around

689
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,100
 because of how encouraging they are.

690
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,220
 Encouragers, you encourage, you have this power

691
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,380
 to change someone's day or their outlook

692
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,460
 or even their life.

693
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,340
 And he says, "If you serve, do so as a representative

694
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,800
 "of God's army, understanding that it's by his grace

695
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,100
 "that you serve," right?

696
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,100
 I think of my friend Morgan, who serves as an assistant,

697
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,040
 administrative assistant to the young adult team.

698
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,720
 Like she's always so positive,

699
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,460
 and whenever you encourage her, she's always like,

700
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,000
 "Oh, it's by God's grace," you know?

701
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,120
 And it's not this platitude or this cliche saying,

702
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,260
 like she believes it.

703
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,040
 And it's just like Morgan's an amazing PR person for God.

704
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,640
 She makes him look really, really good

705
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,080
 because she's constantly talking about the good things

706
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,700
 that he's doing through her.

707
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,700
 She is soberly aware that it is God doing those good things.

708
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,720
 If you were here for the Church Leaders Conference,

709
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,680
 you heard Todd today talk about a time

710
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,580
 when he had the opportunity, he was just mopping a floor.

711
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,780
 And he had the opportunity to do that

712
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,400
 for an audience of just God,

713
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,420
 or he could have lifted the shutters

714
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,000
 so that hundreds of people as they passed by

715
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,460
 would see him mopping the floors.

716
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,080
 And he talked about how we do things for the glory of God,

717
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,120
 not for the praise of humans,

718
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,020
 not for the glory of self or the glory of man,

719
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,940
 that everything we do, we do for the glory of God,

720
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,440
 not needing something from people, but serving folks.

721
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,720
 As I was talking with my kids this week,

722
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,640
 and one of them was angry and sad,

723
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,640
 and I asked them, I knew I had been in this first,

724
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,400
 and I just asked them, "Hey, let me ask you a question."

725
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,760
 Like they were really frustrated,

726
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,640
 and just, I was having a hard time.

727
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
 If you're ever just sad, you don't know why you're sad,

728
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,440
 that's a little bit what we were dealing with.

729
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,560
 They're like, "I'm just sad, Dad."

730
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,400
 I'm like, "Why are you sad?"

731
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,600
 "I don't know why, I don't know why I'm sad."

732
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,280
 And that's tough, that's hard to parent, I'll be honest.

733
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,480
 I said, "Let me ask you a question.

734
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
 "How are you doing at serving?"

735
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,200
 And she said, "I don't know, I'm not what you mean."

736
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,760
 I'm like, "How are you doing at using your powers?

737
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,840
 "How are you doing at loving people,

738
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
 "encouraging people, and serving them?"

739
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,360
 I don't know.

740
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,480
 And I said, "Let me tell you about

741
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,240
 "one of my favorite things when I was in Israel.

742
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,020
 "When I was in Israel, there's a Sea of Galilee,

743
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,520
 "it's beautiful, it's full of life,

744
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,440
 "it's filled with fish, and it's surrounded

745
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
 "by greenery and flowers,

746
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,080
 "and all of these beautiful things to see.

747
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,560
 "And so I love it."

748
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,280
 You can see why Jesus did so much ministry

749
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,600
 in the Sea of Galilee, and it was this thoroughfare

750
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,640
 from one city to the next, to the next, to the next.

751
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,360
 And the Sea of Galilee, out of the Sea of Galilee

752
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,320
 flows the River Jordan, and the River Jordan

753
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,080
 flows down to what's called the Dead Sea.

754
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,760
 Now the Dead Sea couldn't be more different

755
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,600
 than the Sea of Galilee.

756
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,440
 There's nothing that grows around it,

757
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
 there's nothing that lives in it,

758
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,080
 there's no fish in it, it's completely dead.

759
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,920
 Why?

760
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,160
 Because there's a river flowing into it

761
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,560
 and nothing flowing out of it.

762
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,480
 The sun evaporates the water, it leaves behind the minerals,

763
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,740
 and nothing can grow in the Dead Sea,

764
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,180
 because it receives but it does not give.

765
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,880
 And likewise, literally, you are dying, becoming,

766
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,200
 and I'm saying this not for shock value,

767
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,300
 because I believe it's true, becoming mentally ill

768
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,860
 if you just receive and never give out.

769
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,040
 You will become dead from the inside.

770
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,920
 Every person that I've talked to that struggles

771
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,000
 with their thoughts and anxieties

772
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,080
 and obsessive, compulsive things,

773
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,080
 they receive, it starts with being fixated on self and

774
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,780
 you just consume and never give out.

775
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,920
 And you were not made to do that, you're a conduit.

776
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,840
 You're a conduit.

777
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,640
 You're a conduit of God's grace,

778
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,580
 that's what the scripture says,

779
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,980
 that you're giving and extending God's grace to others

780
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,500
 in the way that you serve them,

781
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,300
 through your words and through your actions.

782
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,200
 And so next time you're sad,

783
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,960
 or angry,

784
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,600
 or frustrated, or focused on yourself,

785
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,660
 are you building up walls of worry,

786
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,420
 or are you turning thoughts into prayers

787
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,500
 as though you're running out of time in the last days?

788
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,460
 (congregation laughing)

789
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,180
 What I'm trying to tell you is your bucket list

790
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,820
 is not about how many things you can experience

791
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,140
 or places you can go.

792
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,500
 It's not like, hey, what do I need to do?

793
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,820
 What parts of the world do I need to see?

794
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,220
 It's how can I pray with a great, sane mind,

795
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,860
 with sobriety, and how can I love

796
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,540
 in a way that's stretched out, uncomfortably,

797
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,180
 giving my life away, and how can I serve,

798
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,660
 sharing the gifts that God has entrusted to me with others

799
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,380
 in the way that I speak words of encouragement over them,

800
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,500
 in the way that I serve them, and help them,

801
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,780
 and am hospitable to them, expecting nothing in return,

802
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,340
 because while you might think you have the day,

803
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,820
 one day, much sooner than you think,

804
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,580
 you are going to have your last day.

805
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:39,660
 You are going to be out of time.

806
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,900
 Done.

807
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
 Nothing else.

808
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,900
 Nothing else you can give.

809
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,900
 And I don't know if it's because Jesus comes back

810
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,900
 or you just don't breathe,

811
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,900
 but what are you going to do with your life?

812
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,900
 Make a million dollars before you're 30?

813
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,900
 Some of you, it's too late.

814
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,900
 (congregation laughing)

815
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,900
 It's too late.

816
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,900
 (congregation laughing)

817
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
 I don't know if the plans in your life

818
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,900
 have gone the way you thought they would.

819
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
 I don't know.

820
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
 What are you going to do with your life?

821
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
 Do you really believe there's a God?

822
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,900
 Do you really believe there's a God?

823
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
 Do you really believe there's a God?

824
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
 Do you really believe there's a creator,

825
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
 the heavens and the earth, and he has plans for you,

826
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
 he's numbered your days, he knows how long you live,

827
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
 when you die, he's the only one that knows

828
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
 when Christ comes back.

829
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
 Do you really believe that?

830
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
 Do you really believe that your salvation

831
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,900
 cost him his son on a cross?

832
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,900
 And he goes into the grave and he defeats death

833
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
 and raises back, giving you hope

834
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,900
 and a promise for eternal life.

835
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
 Do you really believe that?

836
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
 Do you really believe that?

837
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,900
 Do you live like you believe that?

838
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,900
 How are you doing at this bucket list of Christianity?

839
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
 When you came in, you got a porch news,

840
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
 would you grab that for me?

841
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
 The porch news, the little thing they handed you

842
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
 when you came in?

843
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
 Would you grab that for me?

844
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,900
 It's where you all move and you grab it.

845
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,900
 Some of you are like, what did he say?

846
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,900
 It's got a list on the back, what I'd love for you to do.

847
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,900
 I'd love 100% unanimous participation in this.

848
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
 It's a really simple ask.

849
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,900
 Would you just take time to fill that out?

850
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,900
 Things that you want to do before now

851
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,900
 and Christ takes you home.

852
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,900
 You may think in terms of categories of praying

853
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,900
 with a sober mind, loving bigger than you're comfortable

854
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
 and sharing the gifts that God has entrusted

855
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
 to you with others.

856
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
 To him be the glory and the power forever and ever,

857
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
 amen it says.

858
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
 Amen is a word you use probably all the time

859
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
 but you may not know what it means.

860
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,900
 It means so be it.

861
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,900
 Peter's saying there's going to be an amen

862
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
 to all things as you know.

863
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,900
 There's going to be a so be it moment

864
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
 to the world as you know it.

865
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
 Your bucket list is to pray with perspective,

866
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,900
 to love without limits and to give your gifts

867
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
 for God's glory.

868
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
 These aren't things to do before you die.

869
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,900
 They are things to do or else you're literally dying.

870
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,900
 They're the essence of living as a Christ follower.

871
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,900
 To live as a Christian is to give your life to Christ.

872
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
 It's the greatest commandment, love God

873
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
 with all your heart, soul, mind and strength

874
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
 and love your neighbor as yourself.

875
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,900
 He says I can summarize all of the law in this action

876
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,900
 that you give your life to God and to people.

877
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,900
 I'll wrap up with this.

878
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
 Let's see, I've been on staff for 11 years

879
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
 so about 11 years ago, 10 years ago,

880
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,900
 I'd just come on staff and Todd, senior pastor here,

881
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
 pulled me aside and just said hey,

882
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,900
 there's a man who died and he has two sons

883
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
 who are both young adults that survived him

884
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
 and I'm going to go meet with him

885
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
 because I'm going to do his funeral.

886
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
 Would you like to go along?

887
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
 I didn't know Todd well at all and I'm like

888
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
 of course man, any time with you, let's go.

889
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
 We get in his car and we're driving down the road

890
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
 and we're driving in the part of town,

891
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
 the really nice part of town,

892
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,900
 really nice part of Dallas if you're listening

893
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,900
 and this is the part where there's like huge houses

894
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,900
 inside the city limits but not just huge houses,

895
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,900
 huge houses on huge lots of lands like estates

896
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
 and I'm like wow, who is this guy?

897
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
 You know and we pull up to this gate

898
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
 and the gate kind of opens slowly

899
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,900
 and we drive down this cobblestone road

900
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
 and we get to this, you know,

901
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,900
 we pull up to this house about seven or eight

902
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
 and I yell to the, no, we get to this house

903
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,900
 and it is huge white house with these big pillars

904
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
 and the yard looks like the arboretum

905
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,900
 like there's just flowers and manicured lawns

906
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
 and it's crazy and we go inside

907
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
 and on the wall, I'm not kidding,

908
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
 there's like Rembrandts and Monets,

909
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,900
 these huge paintings, like just incredible paintings

910
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,900
 and I'm walking and everything in the house is amazing

911
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
 and we sit down with these two sons

912
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
 in their 20s in their mourning,

913
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
 they just lost their father

914
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,900
 and we're talking to them and I noticed,

915
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
 you know, as we talk and we're sharing the gospel

916
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,900
 and we're having these conversations about their dad

917
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
 and their dad, they tell us, you know,

918
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
 he became a Christian late in his life

919
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,900
 and he became a devoted follower of Jesus

920
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
 kind of in his last days

921
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,900
 and I noticed that in the midst of all

922
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,900
 of the really nice paintings and large pieces of furniture,

923
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,900
 there were Post-it notes, yellow Post-it notes.

924
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
 I said, hey, let me ask you a question.

925
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,900
 What's up with the Post-it notes?

926
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,900
 And one of them said, oh man, when dad,

927
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,900
 when dad found out he was dying,

928
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,900
 he just wanted to be surrounded with the word of God.

929
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,900
 He wanted people to encourage him

930
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,900
 with the truth of God through the scriptures,

931
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,900
 to speak the words of God to him

932
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,900
 and he asked us to put verses all over the house,

933
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
 these Post-it notes.

934
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
 What else?

935
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,900
 Oh man, he just wanted to share Christ with everybody.

936
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,900
 Like in his last days, he would have us invite people over

937
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
 so he could share the gospel with them

938
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
 and he would call his nurses in his room

939
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
 to share the gospel and his doctors,

940
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,900
 he would say, hey, let me just talk to you for a minute

941
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,900
 and he would tell them about how they were created

942
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
 by a God who loves them, separated from him by their sin

943
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
 and that he had sent his only son, Jesus Christ,

944
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
 to die for their sins.

945
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,900
 He just was sharing the gospel with everybody he could.

946
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
 Wow, what else?

947
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,900
 What else?

948
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,900
 Well, dad, he was a really well-resourced man.

949
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
 Like yeah, no kidding.

950
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
 (congregation laughing)

951
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,900
 And when he found out he was dying,

952
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,900
 he just wanted to give it all away

953
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
 and in fact, he became really frustrated.

954
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,900
 He had asked us to call over attorneys

955
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,900
 because he had locked all of his money up in trust

956
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,900
 and had assigned a power of attorney to someone

957
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,900
 and it took a lot of paperwork and processes

958
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
 to even liquidate his money

959
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
 and he just wanted to give it all away.

960
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,900
 He was frustrated that he couldn't do that.

961
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
 What else?

962
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
 What else?

963
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,900
 And they looked at each other and they laughed

964
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
 and they looked at us and they said,

965
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,900
 well, people thought he was crazy.

966
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
 Why?

967
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
 Why did they think he was crazy?

968
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,900
 Because he'd sit up in his bed and he'd tell us,

969
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,900
 he'd stare straight through us and he'd say,

970
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,900
 don't wait, don't wait like I did.

971
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,900
 Don't you wait, don't wait.

972
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
 And they didn't know what he was talking about,

973
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
 but we knew.

974
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,900
 See, in his last days, dad knew what it meant

975
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,900
 to live as a person following Jesus.

976
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,900
 He started to get the bucket list

977
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
 that Peter's talking about.

978
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,900
 You can learn a lot from a man

979
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,900
 who is sitting on his deathbed.

980
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,900
 What are you gonna do with your life?

981
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,900
 You gonna waste it on you?

982
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,900
 What are you gonna do with your life?

983
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
 Don't wait.

984
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,900
 Don't wait like he did.

985
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,900
 The end of all things is near.

986
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,900
 Let me pray.

987
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,900
 And Father, we thank you for this truth

988
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
 through your servant Peter.

989
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,900
 For the reminder that you've given us.

990
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,900
 And Lord, we just ask that as we read these words,

991
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
 that not in a manipulative way

992
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,900
 or just a motivating way,

993
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
 that tomorrow we would wake up

994
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,900
 and we would search the scriptures

995
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
 and wonder what you have for us

996
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,900
 and that we would take the activities

997
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,900
 that we're involved in

998
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,900
 and the things that we scheduled.

999
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
 And Lord, the things that are not consistent

1000
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
 with what you want us to do,

1001
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
 we'd reprioritize.

1002
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,900
 Would you help us reprioritize?

1003
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,900
 Would you help us to pray with sober minds?

1004
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,900
 Help us to love in ways that are uncomfortable?

1005
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,900
 And help us to share the gifts

1006
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,900
 that you've entrusted to us

1007
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
 for the common good of the brotherhood and sisterhood

1008
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,900
 for Christians everywhere.

1009
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
 And Lord, we thank you for this text.

1010
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,900
 And would you change us through it?

1011
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1012
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,240
