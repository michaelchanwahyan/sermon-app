[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:19.900]   - All right, Porch, how's it going?
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.660]   Yeah, it's good to be with you guys.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.800]   My name's Todd, I get to hang out here at Watermark with you.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.120]   I got to hang out with you a couple weeks ago.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.100]   We're gonna dive in again.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.720]   My friend JP's gone, and so you won't miss him.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.820]   I'm gonna tell you a story about my kids.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.400]   'Cause isn't that what JP always does?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.560]   So I'm starting all over, man.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.120]   I got my first grandkid, right?
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.880]   I know I just lost all street cred with you guys,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.720]   but that's all right.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   I'm a grandfather.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   That is the first actual life stage that has not fit in me.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.000]   You know, I can remember when I turned 10,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   you were double digits.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.840]   I was like, okay, I'm double digits, no big deal.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.280]   It was, it kind of rolled off my back.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.440]   Hit 13, I was a teenager.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.060]   For me, I was about 10 years away from puberty.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.140]   It was all good, 13 wasn't that big a deal.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   16, hit me, I got my license.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.580]   I was free to go where I wanted to go.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.060]   That was fine.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.380]   18, graduated from high school.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.660]   I was 17 when I got out of high school.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.500]   That was no big deal.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.780]   Got out of college, that didn't seem weird.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.620]   I was that guy.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.900]   I was now in my 20s and cranking along.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.500]   I got married, that seemed like normal, okay?
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.180]   It kind of hit me just right.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.940]   I had a baby, that was cool, that was fine.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.380]   I married my daughter, that didn't freak me out.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.260]   I didn't marry her, my daughter,
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.460]   that would have freaked me out.
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.120]   Married my daughter off, key word there.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.880]   Married my daughter off, that didn't freak me out.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   But then a year ago on Father's Day,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.720]   my daughter gave me an envelope, said happy,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200]   and she had father's scratched out and grand put on top of it
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.520]   now that freaked me out.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   I'm like, that's a life stage I'm not really ready
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.240]   to be associated with.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.000]   You know, grandpa, no teeth, close to the grave.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.640]   And so that was different for me.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.880]   I wasn't really ready to go there, but I'm there, man.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.300]   It's awesome, so I got new kid stories coming.
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.400]   I'm gonna tell you an old kid story.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.180]   So my daughters are, right now my oldest is 24,
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.780]   that's the one that gave me the baby, my other one's 21.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.720]   She's out of college and hangs out
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.860]   with you guys here sometimes.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.980]   When they were three and five,
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.580]   I decided to take them on a bike ride.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.900]   I threw them at the back of that little, you know,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.700]   carousel you strap on the back of a bike.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.660]   And my whole life I had always blessed my kids.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.940]   I'd love to take them for ice cream and things like that.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.380]   And love to take them to go get some, you know,
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.480]   candy at different times, but this was different.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.000]   I was gonna actually let them go on their own
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.960]   on a bike ride with me.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.740]   And there wasn't a Buc-ee's near us, okay.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.940]   It wasn't even a Buc-ee's around at the time.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.060]   But had there been, I'd have taken them to a Buc-ee's
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.060]   'cause Buc-ee's has the biggest candy selection I know of
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.100]   that you can go kind of walk up and down these huge aisles.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.520]   But I took them to the biggest candy store that was near us.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.160]   And we walked into this candy store and I just said,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.500]   okay girls, you're three, you're five.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.000]   You can get whatever you want.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.180]   Just pick an item, it's yours.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.020]   You get to choose it.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.100]   There's no decree that's coming from dad,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.940]   but I'm just gonna tell you
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.180]   as we get ready to walk in these doors,
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.260]   your dad knows candy.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.740]   I am good at candy.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.660]   I've studied candy, I eat candy, I love candy.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.740]   I hide candy from your mom.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.540]   I am good at candy.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.620]   And so I'll help you, all right.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.460]   I'll give you all the counsel I can,
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.980]   but let's go, you're free.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.400]   And so we walk into the store and my five-year-old, Ali,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.160]   immediately grabs my hand and she says,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.920]   daddy, what should I get?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.240]   And I go, oh baby.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   And I leaned over, I picked her up
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.320]   and we walk over to that candy aisle.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.580]   Three-year-old in tow, Kirby behind us.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.680]   And we start looking around
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.000]   at all the different candies that are there
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.920]   and I'm explaining to her the wonders of chocolate,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.560]   you know, and reminding her what that is,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.240]   what's behind those different wrappers
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.560]   and letting her know about all the different stuff.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.700]   I looked down and Kirby was already done.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.320]   Kirby had made her decision.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   She's, you know, jerking at my shorts.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   She said, let's go, I got it.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.620]   I'm like, okay, Kirby, hang on a second.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.760]   And I'm gonna help you in just a minute.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.600]   Let daddy help you.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   And she just kind of looked at me like, I got what I want.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.160]   And so I go, okay, Kirby, just hang on a second.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.200]   Ali, let me just explain something to you, Ali.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.560]   This stuff up here, this is where the really good stuff is.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.120]   Down low is just the single stuff.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   Up here is the like pound bags of candy.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.100]   And so, you know, I'm taking my little daughter
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.640]   and I'm just saying, hey, check it out.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.320]   This is a pound bag of Skittles, okay.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.660]   It's not a little bag of Skittles.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.840]   You might want to consider this one
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.480]   'cause it's got like Skittles for a week right here, okay.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.040]   These are Starbursts, they're hard to unwrap.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.680]   You can't get to them as quickly as the Skittles,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   but they're good.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.640]   This will last you a long time.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.760]   Okay, your dad, your dad is a big fan of Reese's, okay.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.600]   Let's get this one.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   Or how about this, peanut M&M's.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   That's the way to go right here.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   All right, this is where dad loves peanut M&M's.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.500]   Get the pound bag of peanut M&M's.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.640]   And on and on we went
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   through all these different things of candy.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   And anyway, Ali settles on the pound bag of Skittles.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.920]   This is what she's got.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.440]   Five years old with her own pound bag of Skittles.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   And I put her down and Ali immediately goes, oh, Curbs.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.580]   Listen to that, dad is good.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.780]   Dad knows candy, right?
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.220]   And Kirby was like, I'm good.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.500]   I got what I want.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.360]   And so I looked down at what Kirby has
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.880]   and Kirby's got her arm, you know,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.780]   kind of tucked in tight and I unlock her little fist
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.780]   and she's got in her hand
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.040]   what would fit in a little three-year-old's hand.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.340]   It's a single piece of candy.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.340]   Now I looked at it, I gotta admit, it was kind of cool.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.940]   It was big and it had a really nice wrapping.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.280]   It had this really bright yellow wrapping around the red.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.980]   And I looked a little closer and I saw it was in fact
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.740]   this little bad boy right here, which is an atomic fireball.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.580]   All right.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.260]   Now I gotta admit, it's impressive looking, okay?
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.140]   Nice wrapper.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.180]   And by the way, where was Kirby?
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.700]   Her little three-year-old eyes,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.140]   where her little three-year-old eyes could see,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.860]   that she couldn't see up to the wonders
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.060]   of pound bags of candy.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.540]   All she saw was down there where the loose candies were,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.420]   the single Jolly Ranchers, right?
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.620]   The individual piece of the bazooka bubble gum.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.820]   And then this little gem right here,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.660]   which she locked on, it fit neatly inside
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.820]   a little three-year-old hand.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.300]   And I just go, "Kirbs, no, you don't want that."
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.860]   She looked at me like, "Hey, I thought we could come in here
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.560]   "and get whatever we wanted.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.520]   "Are you retrading?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.420]   "Have I just stumbled onto some gold down here
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.540]   "that you don't want me to know about?"
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.160]   And so I looked in those little three-year-old eyes
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.000]   trying to communicate all that.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.980]   I said, "Okay, come on.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.020]   "You don't wanna listen to Dad?
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.020]   "You wanna go with your little three-year-old wisdom?
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.860]   "Let's go."
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.980]   We slapped the pound bag of Skittles up there.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.860]   We put the little atomic fireball up there.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.700]   Paid for 'em both.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.660]   We walked outside.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.900]   We sat on the curb.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.140]   You know, we opened up this thing.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.620]   Now look, I want you to just follow with me.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.060]   You got a little three-year-old, right?
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.100]   And so Allie goes first, and she dips into her little bag,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.240]   and she brings out a little red wonder that big.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.060]   Kirby, on the other hand, has got this bad boy working.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.020]   It pops in her mouth, it's like, "I'm all good.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.100]   "You follow Dad's advice.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.300]   "I'm having a big time."
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.460]   So Allie, you know, pops a little Skittle in there,
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.300]   and she's kinda chewing it.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.540]   Kirby goes in her own way.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.260]   Now let me ask you a question.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.260]   What happens when you put an atomic fireball in your mouth?
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.100]   The answer is, right away,
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.100]   it's got this thin layer of sugary sweetness.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.620]   And for a while, you had a big old nod of goodness,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.540]   and you're looking at Dad like,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.680]   "You ripped off that other girl.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.860]   "She got a little, you know,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.900]   "I can't see what else is in there.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.420]   "She just saw one red one come out.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.820]   "She's got a big red one."
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.300]   And Kirby's sitting there, you know,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   getting that thing in her mouth, letting her saliva go to work
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.780]   kinda sucking on that thing all happy,
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.020]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.780]   that little thin layer of sugary sweetness
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.980]   that was the result of her informed three-year-old choice
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.860]   started to fade away.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.260]   And out like a projectile,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.360]   the vomit of a three-month-old comes as fireball.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.200]   And I'm ready.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.020]   I'm like,
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.020]   No, we're gonna eat this candy, right?
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.420]   And so with all the brilliance of a 30-something-year-old
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.260]   dad, I just put it right back in her mouth,
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.420]   and I go, "Now, Kirby."
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.940]   And like brilliant young dads are prone to do,
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.860]   we engage in a conversation that's less than time, right?
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.500]   And so, you know, there's this forest fire of, you know,
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.300]   disease happening in her mouth.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.380]   And I'm going, "Now, this is what happens
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.440]   "when you're gonna listen to your daddy, right?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.560]   "Daddy, I told you, he knows candy.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.400]   "You're three years old.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.780]   "You think you know what you want?"
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.820]   And Kirby's looking at me, you know,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.380]   her little eyes are getting a little bit more red,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380]   little tears, right?
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.220]   And so, you know, she spits it out.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.140]   All right.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.900]   And I go, "Okay."
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.920]   And I kind of put in my hand, we went home,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.340]   and we sat down, Allie just sat there,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.380]   one in front of her, just kind of dumped out the Skittles,
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.220]   just eating them one at a time.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.380]   "Oh, here's a purple one, right?
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.220]   "A green one."
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.140]   And I, you know, took Kirby's now pocket-lint-covered
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.340]   atomic fireball, put it on the table.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.460]   "Kirby, you can have the rest of your candy
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.340]   "anytime you want."
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.300]   And we actually sat there,
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.180]   and here's what happened.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.540]   I'm exaggerating a little bit, obviously,
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.540]   about what I did to my little Kirby,
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.700]   but there was something that came into my mind
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.900]   not long after I did that.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.020]   And it was literally that night
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.100]   as I was kind of reliving it,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.100]   and it hit me where the Lord just said to me,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.320]   "Hey, Todd, you know, we're a lot like that.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.740]   "In your three decades of living,
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.420]   "you're pretty sure that what you can see is what's good.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.240]   "What you think makes sense to you,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.560]   "you grab it all the time,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.460]   "and I'm just trying to pick you up.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.140]   "And I'm trying to encourage you,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.820]   "I'm trying to show you where the really good stuff is,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.180]   "but you're so cocksure that you know how to select things,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.220]   "and I give you freedom to select whatever you want.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.700]   "And here's the thing, you are free.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.700]   "I'm not gonna force myself on you,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.100]   "but freedom isn't being able to do whatever you wanna do.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.900]   "Freedom is being able to do what leads to life.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.240]   "And when you have the freedom
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.740]   "to not be a slave to your flesh
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.960]   "and your 30 years of finite wisdom,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.920]   "when you learn, Todd, to freely love me because I love you,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   "you're gonna stop grabbing all the atomic fireballs
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.640]   "that are so attractive to you."
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.480]   And it really has become a metaphor in our family.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.160]   We talked a lot about that, and we did.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.580]   We had this little family conversation.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.080]   We talked about how there are things that make sense to us,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.400]   that we can see certain things,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.140]   and we don't believe that God is good.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.160]   We don't believe that God can be trusted.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.440]   And so as a result of that,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.020]   we're grabbing stuff all the time.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.120]   And listen, when you grab sin,
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.360]   there's a reason sin is tempting.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.160]   It looks like it's gonna be life-giving.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   And when you first grab it,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.860]   sometimes there's this jolt of adrenaline and fun.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.720]   But it doesn't take long
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.160]   for that thin layer of sugary sweetness to wear off.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.000]   And there's this sting.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.120]   Sometimes it leaves scars
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.720]   and numbs us to real good taste.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.180]   The Bible says, "Be on the alert.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.200]   "Be of sober spirit,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.060]   "because you've got an adversary who doesn't love you."
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.060]   He is the devil.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.240]   He accuses God of not being who he says he is.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.080]   He'll accuse you of not being worthy
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.040]   of a relationship with God.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.880]   And he is looking to devour you.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.720]   We are making our way through 1 Peter,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.540]   and that's exactly where we are in the text.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.300]   1 Peter chapter five, let's read it.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.200]   "Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.420]   "Your adversary, the devil,"
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.140]   who I'm gonna show you who he is in just a moment,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.500]   and he is a liar.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.580]   "Prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.540]   "seeking somebody to devour."
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.160]   Verse nine, "But resist him.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.060]   "Be firm in your faith,
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.420]   "knowing that the same experience of suffering
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.900]   "are being accomplished by your brethren
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.980]   "who are in the world."
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.880]   Hey, listen, after you've suffered for a little while,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.720]   it's not as long as you think,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.920]   "The God of all grace,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.100]   "who called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.960]   "will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.660]   "and establish you.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.160]   "To him, the one who deserves it,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.120]   "and the one who is worthy of it,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.260]   "the one who is all-powerful,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.900]   "that you should listen to who loves you.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.940]   "To him be dominion forever and ever."
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.660]   Amen.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.060]   Here's the deal.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.740]   We serve a God
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.380]   that is known in the scripture as one who is
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.020]   a sun and a shield.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.100]   Sun gives light.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.100]   A sun gives off that which causes growth
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.460]   and goodness to happen.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.060]   A sun produces for us that which we need.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.580]   We can't live without the sun,
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.660]   hitting those little green plants,
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.780]   getting that chlorophyll active,
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.140]   and photosynthesis go to work,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.540]   so plants get richer and stronger,
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.580]   and provide us shade, and provide us food.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.820]   The Lord God is a sun, and he's a shield.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.660]   He is a protector.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.560]   He's a provider, and he's a protector.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.300]   And then it says in Psalm 84, verse 11,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.960]   "No good thing does he withhold from those who love him."
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.980]   He gives grace and glory.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.480]   And he's saying, "Todd, come here, man.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.720]   "You wanna go pursue whatever you wanna,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.980]   "you can, you're free,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.840]   "but I'm gonna give you stuff you don't deserve.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.400]   "I'm gonna give you insight you don't have,
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.340]   "and I want you to have things
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.120]   "that only a loving father would want you to have.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.260]   "I'm not trying to rip you off,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.320]   "I'm trying to set you free.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.640]   "I'm trying to scoop you up,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.720]   "and give you what you don't deserve."
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.620]   And it is glorious, this is who God is.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.140]   The Lord God is a sun and shield.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.540]   He gives grace and glory.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.820]   No good thing
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.820]   does he withhold from your little
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.780]   three-decade-old bright self.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.860]   And so get off that bottom shelf
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.380]   of grabbing what you think makes sense to you.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.800]   That's gonna give you just a very thin moment
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.860]   of sweetness, and then it's gonna be something
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.200]   you're gonna wanna spit out,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.500]   and you're gonna wonder if anybody can ever love you again,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.000]   because you grabbed that thing.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.420]   You have an adversary, the devil,
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.740]   and he wants to ruin you.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.660]   We are at war.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.660]   And there's a God who wants us to win and do well.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.380]   The verses that we looked at last week
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.740]   in 1 Peter chapter five, it says this, right?
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.540]   Remember, "You younger men, be subject to your elders."
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.380]   In other words, listen, some guys that are there
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.860]   before you that have given you an example to follow,
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.740]   that have lived life, that have learned some lessons
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.260]   in a really painful way, listen,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.060]   you can learn what you need to learn through experience,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.260]   and the problem with experience,
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.940]   it's a great teacher, right?
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.220]   But a lot of times, it's a very expensive one, isn't it?
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.700]   And so it says, "Pay attention to your elders,"
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.840]   'cause they've grabbed some stuff
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.460]   that looked good to them when they were three, too.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.620]   "Listen to them, because they've come to know
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.980]   "what the older brothers should always know."
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.260]   See, Allie could tell Kirby, "Listen to Dad."
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.980]   Both of my kids, since the moment they were little,
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.740]   I cared for them, I protected them, I provided for them.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.660]   No good thing did I withhold from them.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.980]   But Allie had two more years of experience with me,
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.260]   and so her first response, when I offered her
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.180]   whatever she wanted, was to look to me and say,
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.660]   "Dad, what would you choose?"
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.080]   "Kirby, listen to him.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.380]   "I know him better than you.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.980]   "I've lived with him longer than you.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.700]   "I have prospered more than you
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.860]   "because I've listened to him."
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.860]   That's what older brothers should do.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.140]   "You younger men," it says, "You younger folks,
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.220]   "be subject to your elders."
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.440]   And then it says, "And all of you,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.500]   "clothe yourself with humility to one another."
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.340]   Why?
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.460]   "For God is opposed to the proud,
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.820]   "but gives grace to the humble.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.540]   "Humble yourself, therefore."
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.040]   Say, "Dad, what do you want from me?
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.540]   "What do you want for me?"
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.860]   Because what your father wants is life.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.720]   He's come that you might have life,
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.460]   and have it abundantly, but there is a liar.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.820]   And he roams about seeking whom he may devour.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.100]   And gang, we are at war with him.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.000]   When you don't think you're at war,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.660]   you become a little less vigilant.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.740]   You become a little less alive, a little less aware.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.060]   You know, sometimes you're playing a game
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.340]   as simple as hide and seek, and when you know
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.100]   that somebody's trying to capture you and win a game,
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.700]   even as simple as that, you try and slow
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.460]   your breathing down, you're very careful,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.120]   'cause you know that the person who's trying
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.620]   to get you out of the game is close.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   At war, I've never been in a combat situation,
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.180]   but one person said this, "There's something
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.920]   "about war that sharpens the senses.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   "You hear a twig snap or a rustling of the leaves,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.280]   "and you go into attack mode.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.440]   "Someone coughs, and you're ready to pull the trigger.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.400]   "Even after days of little or no sleep,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.740]   "war keeps us vigilant."
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.220]   And here's what I'm gonna tell you.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.160]   We're at war.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.620]   You will not do well in this life
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.260]   if you have the wrong view of who our enemy is.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.140]   If you think of him like some buffoon wearing red leotards
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.380]   with little horns that bounce around, joke.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.420]   You guys remember, I don't know,
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.940]   before probably you started watching Saturday Night Live,
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.620]   there was a guy named John Lovitz,
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.660]   and he did a skit on Saturday Night Live
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.700]   where it was a people's court
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.060]   where some young girl had sold her soul
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.860]   in order to become a world-class hairdresser.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.640]   And Judge Wapner was listening to the case
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.260]   where she was suing to get her soul back
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.220]   because he did what he said she would do.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.280]   He'd make her a world-class hairdresser,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.500]   but what he did is he kind of tricked her
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.300]   because she was so good that the hairstyles
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.040]   she created in people were never, ever affected again
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.220]   by weather or by time.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.820]   And so she never had any repeat business
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.740]   and she went bankrupt.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.260]   And she was suing for her soul back.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.140]   And John Lovitz was the Satan figure.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.260]   At the very end, there's a hilarious little scene
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.140]   where he comes out and he's being interviewed as he leaves,
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.300]   and he just kind of looks at the camera
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.780]   when he realizes he's getting run out,
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.780]   and he just starts to look at the camera.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.620]   He goes, "Oh, obey me, obey me.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.420]   "I am the Lord of darkness."
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.220]   And if you think of Satan as some buffoon like that,
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.460]   you're not gonna be very vigilant.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.620]   Likewise, you might not even think you can fight him
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.440]   if you see him as this irrepressible force
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.280]   that you're going to have to be subservient to.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.260]   What's so amazing is that 60% of all believers
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.320]   don't even acknowledge the reality of an enemy.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.060]   They don't think there is an adversary that's out there.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.020]   Many people who think there's an adversary that's out there
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.500]   think he's equal with God,
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.240]   and there's no way to defend themself against him.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.820]   And your Bible that God's given you says,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.660]   no, no, you have an adversary,
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.180]   but greater is he who is in you, this God,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.340]   the God who it says right there in 1 Peter chapter five,
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.700]   is the one who has dominion forever and ever.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.620]   He is your father, he is your friend,
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.620]   and he has given you the ability to not be a slave to sin.
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.300]   The whole book of 1 Peter is about you doing well
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.980]   against persecution and against the trouble
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.940]   that's in this world,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.900]   and God's trying to help believers stand firm
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.020]   against the fiery ordeal all around them,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.640]   and specifically it's gonna end with the temptation
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.480]   that wages war against our soul.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.940]   Now here's what you need to do.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.340]   When you go to war, you want to find out
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.780]   how's your enemy gonna fight, who is he,
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.620]   what's his tactics, and there's no surprise.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.740]   He always does the same thing.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.020]   He whispers in your little three-decade-old mind,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.860]   three-year-old mind, 23-year-old mind,
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.100]   you can't trust your dad.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.980]   His character isn't good, his word isn't true.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.180]   He is not, in fact, holy.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.020]   He's not a sun and a shield.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.420]   He doesn't give you light in life.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.060]   He doesn't provide for you anything.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.100]   He's not a, anything that's gonna protect you.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.220]   You gotta get out from underneath him.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.100]   Grab your own candy, use your own eyes.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.820]   Please your own self.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.620]   As foolish as that is for a three-year-old to do,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.560]   it is infinitely more foolish for us to do.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.400]   The most important thing about you always
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.160]   is gonna be your view of God.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.200]   That's why we say this all the time,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   because if you buy the lie that God isn't good,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.340]   his word isn't true, disobeying him is not that big a deal,
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.000]   and that life can be found when you go your own way,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.240]   your adversary has you right where he wants you.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.040]   And he's no fool.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.140]   He wraps things very well.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.200]   He makes them look really enticing and exciting.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.240]   He'll even give you some immediate feedback
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.800]   so that your brain hardwires itself to want it
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.240]   and to like it, but there is always a crash.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.800]   There's always another side.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.600]   Indians and Asian Indians have a saying
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.440]   that goes like this.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.560]   It says, "He who rides a tiger must prepare to dismount."
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.760]   You know, when you ride a tiger, that's a big deal.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   You look pretty bad to the bone.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.200]   You're on this thing, and everybody's looking at you.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.240]   Man, he's alive and apart.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.560]   That guy's riding a tiger.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.480]   Look at him.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.400]   That guy's hilarious.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.240]   He's fun to be with.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.200]   He's crazy.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.640]   His stories are amazing.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.080]   But I'm gonna tell you, man,
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.520]   there's a time when you dismount,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.960]   when you're alone in your room,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.120]   and you're staring at the ceiling,
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.920]   when you look over at that bed,
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.880]   and you go, "I don't even know his name."
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.460]   Those decisions I've been making
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.600]   to find some sense of meaning and love,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.700]   they're not giving me meaning.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.760]   I don't feel very loved.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.600]   I feel used.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.660]   Here I go again.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.020]   When you get through the pleasure of riding a tiger,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:07.860]   and all your girlfriend's like,
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.000]   "Man, how'd you get these guys?"
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.800]   And, "Guys, how'd you get these girls?"
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.640]   All of a sudden, you go,
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.960]   "Man, how do I get this seared soul
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.020]   "that's been eating these atomic choices
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.080]   "that look life-giving to me?"
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.000]   And there's moments of fleeting pleasure,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.240]   but man, they are leaving me numb.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.600]   And your father's not mad at you.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.660]   I wasn't mad at Kirby.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.240]   I just go, "Kirby, we're gonna walk
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.280]   "through a long life together, man.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.420]   "Let this be the worst decision you ever make.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.340]   "Let your decision right there be instructive to me.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.440]   "Be on the alert, man.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.280]   "You are at war."
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.200]   I love the idea that God wants us to be free.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.080]   And again, I wanna tell you,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.280]   true freedom is not the right or ability
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.320]   to do whatever you want to do.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.920]   True freedom is the right or ability
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.800]   to do what leads to life.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.240]   And see, until you know that your Father in heaven is good,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.820]   that He is the one that's not just
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.400]   has dominion forever and ever,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.960]   that His word is true,
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.280]   until you know that His word is good,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.600]   you're not going to listen to Him
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.520]   when you walk through the candy shop of life.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.160]   I love 1 John 5, 3, where it says
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.240]   that this is the love of God,
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.200]   that we keep His commandments,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.520]   and His commandments are not burdensome.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.600]   It's one of the things that I love to tell my friends
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.000]   that are three decades behind me.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.200]   I love to tell you, let me just say, guys,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.880]   I have, by the grace of God, about your age,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.440]   I started being on the alert and being sober-minded,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.000]   in other words, clear thinking.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.680]   I looked around.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.820]   I saw a lot of the people that were still buying the lie
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.660]   that what feels good, you should do.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.720]   And I started to look at what the word said about God,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.960]   and not what I thought God was,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.760]   was some father who was miserly
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.920]   and was trying to slap my hand
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.040]   when I reached for the good stuff.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.960]   And I started to look at the word of God,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.920]   and I saw that God wanted to set me free
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.360]   and give me life indeed,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.440]   that He didn't come to oppress me.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   He came to lift me up.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.840]   And it was the other one who I'd been following,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.520]   and I had learned enough of these lessons already,
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.760]   and He'd been stealing my own sense of self-worth and purpose.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.980]   He'd been killing my joy.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.920]   And He'd been destroying my soul.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.080]   And I believed that there was a God
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.200]   who was gonna give me grace.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.840]   And then slowly, as I began to trust Him,
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   has restored the glory in my life.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.600]   And I'm just telling you,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.920]   as somebody who's walked with Him now for three decades,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.000]   I have never regretted letting my Father pick me up
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.360]   and walk through this life.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.020]   What I thought I'd do with you guys tonight
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.120]   is help you know how to go to war,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   help you think through about truths about this enemy.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.920]   I'm gonna give you seven of 'em.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.760]   Are you ready?
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.300]   We're gonna move kinda quickly through 'em.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.000]   But here are seven things
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.860]   that you need to know about the enemy,
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.380]   because his tactics are always the same.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.040]   He's gonna challenge God's character.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.480]   He's gonna challenge God's justice.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.000]   He's gonna challenge his trustworthiness.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.280]   And he's gonna get you to believe
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   in your own little three-year-old eyes.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.880]   (computer mouse clicking)
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.720]   First one.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.840]   There is no secret about what's coming
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.340]   or who it is coming from.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.640]   In John chapter eight, in verse 44,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.400]   it says, "Your adversary, this one who roams around
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.000]   "like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.260]   "he is a liar.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.880]   "He is the father of lies."
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.280]   That's what he does.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.620]   And whenever God is there to sow truth and life into you,
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.380]   there's something else coming at you
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.060]   that's gonna say, "No, don't listen to him.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.420]   "Satan is not creative.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.880]   "Only God is creative.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.000]   "All Satan does is reverse things."
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.640]   He's gonna tell you, "Don't believe truth.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.260]   "Don't even believe there is truth.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.100]   "Don't believe if somebody's got truth for you,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.440]   "it's to set you free, it's to oppress you,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   "and to make you puritanical,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.300]   "and to make you out of touch,
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.600]   "and to make you miss out on all the fun
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.360]   "that there is in this world."
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.960]   That's the lie.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.840]   And he is a liar.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.440]   Let me just show you in Matthew chapter 13,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.400]   there's a story that you guys are probably familiar with.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.320]   It's the story of a sower.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.680]   And Jesus is telling a story
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.040]   about what happens in this life,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.880]   that God in his grace has brought us people
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   that are gonna go about sowing truth.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.020]   And so watch, it says,
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.380]   "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.120]   "who sowed good seed in his fields.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.480]   "But while his men were sleeping,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   "his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat."
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.700]   And then he went away.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.880]   You see, there's always gonna be people
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.640]   that are gonna try and sow truth and life
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.680]   and help towards you,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.520]   but there's always an enemy who's sowing something else.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.360]   Don't go there.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.400]   Are you kidding me?
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.640]   You even believe there's a God?
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.480]   You believe God's good?
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.680]   You believe he's got your best interest in mind?
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   See, for me, the longest time in my life,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.400]   I thought, man, why would I wanna follow God?
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.240]   Because everything I've heard that God wants me to do,
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.080]   I don't wanna do.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   And everything I do wanna do, he says,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.360]   "You can't do that."
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.940]   And look, I'm gonna tell you, some of that is true.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.300]   But I'm like a three-year-old in a candy shop.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.080]   And Kirby really didn't want to look up there.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.480]   It hurt her neck to look back.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.520]   She wanted the freedom to do whatever she wanted to do.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.820]   And I gave her that freedom,
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.720]   just like God gives you that freedom.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.360]   But how's it working out for you?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.000]   And your father is just trying to tell you,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.760]   hey, listen, don't be surprised.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.960]   There's no secret about what's coming
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.880]   or who it's coming from.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.960]   And so that's why you find things like this in Scripture.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.360]   Don't be deceived.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.040]   Don't walk in the way of the wicked.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.520]   Don't stand in the path of sinners.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.600]   Don't sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.740]   But delight yourself in the law of the Lord.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.120]   And on that law, meditate day and night.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.960]   Why?
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.780]   Why?
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.760]   So you'll be boring, out of touch,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.600]   never have any fun.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.920]   No, so you'll be like a tree
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.800]   firmly planted by streams of water
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.400]   that when everybody else is withering and looking for life,
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.000]   you bear your fruit in season and out of season.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.640]   And whatever you do, you'll prosper.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.720]   Have you paid attention?
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.360]   That's what God wants for you.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.680]   I'm gonna tell you, there's no way
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.720]   that my life would look like it does
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.080]   if I was still grabbing what looked good to me.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.920]   I'm gonna go home tonight, I've said this before,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.680]   to a wife I've been married to coming up on three decades.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.360]   Last night, all six of my kids, my son-in-law,
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.880]   my granddaughter were there.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.800]   We hung out, friends I've had for 30 years came over.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.400]   And we sat and we laughed.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.840]   Our adult children wanted us to hang out with them.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   We played games, we jacked around.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   We had big steaks, we had losers, we had laughter,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.200]   we ate ice cream, and we went to bed
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.840]   and we just go, man, this is good.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.880]   You know what I wanted to do?
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.000]   I wanted to betray that wife.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.220]   I wanna have affairs.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.280]   I'm not a monogamous guy by nature.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.880]   I'm polyamorous.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.360]   I am self-destructive.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.600]   And yet because of the kindness of God,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.320]   he has taught me to be on the alert.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.160]   Do you guys know that there's somebody
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.200]   who's just always sowing lies out there?
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.400]   I came across a study this week that just,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.780]   it made me laugh, and I tweeted about it a little bit.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.280]   I'm gonna show you a few of these tweets.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.120]   There was a study that was done
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.840]   by a major institute in Israel.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.240]   And listen, I don't know how much money they spent on it,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.000]   but basically, the headline that was released last week
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   said this, it said, "Israeli scientists, geneticists,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.700]   "have determined that men are men and women are women."
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.840]   And I thought to myself, oh my gosh.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.220]   It's amazing, science has figured that out?
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.360]   And then it went through and it discussed the fact
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   that hey, you just can't tell that,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.860]   you know, not only can you tell that in anatomy classes
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.560]   and in showers and in French paintings,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.240]   you can actually see that when you go inside.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.060]   They studied 20,000 different genes, they said,
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.960]   inside men and women, and they found out
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.120]   that over 33% of the genes in men
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.400]   and 33% of the genes in women are not just gender neutral,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   they are male, and they're only in men,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.960]   and they're always in men, and they're only in men.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.720]   And what they basically said is this is not
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.900]   a matter of choice, this is a matter of hard biological fact.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.740]   Now listen, what was the reason they did this,
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.380]   I don't know, but have you noticed lately
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.100]   that people are starting to go, I'm not really sure
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.200]   we can say men are men and women are women.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.220]   What's also very interesting about this is,
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.220]   what, for the longest time, have you heard,
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.300]   because you're a person of faith,
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.980]   that you are somehow anti-science?
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.660]   There is nothing in your faith that is anti-science.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.180]   As I've said many times before,
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.460]   the Bible's not a science book,
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.940]   but it doesn't contradict science in any form or fashion.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.700]   I can remember one time we were, as a family,
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.300]   we were actually up in British Columbia,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.880]   we had an Australian waitress who was up there
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.900]   for the summer, and she was engaging with us as a family,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.540]   and I actually, I started talking to her,
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.460]   and I said to her at one point, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.820]   And she goes, no, I don't really have a faith,
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.260]   I guess, gosh, I do.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.900]   She goes, I guess I have faith in science.
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.340]   And I had just been through this with my kids,
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.480]   and so I turned to my 13-year-old boy at the time,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.260]   I said, hey, Kate, I go, tell her why
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.980]   we believe what we believe, and in fact,
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.580]   you know, we don't have faith in science,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.700]   we have faith in God, that God has revealed himself
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.320]   in his word, and tell her why it's a good idea
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.580]   that the Bible is not a science book.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.180]   And he was ready, he just looked, and she looked at him,
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.140]   she goes, yeah, why is it a good idea
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.420]   the Bible's not a science book?
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.580]   And he says, because a science book changes
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.020]   every two or three years.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:03.160]   And she just stopped, and she goes, you know what?
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.180]   She goes, you're right.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.180]   And I go, we've got a God who's not a liar,
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.780]   he's not a son of man that he should repent,
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.060]   and if he says it, it'll happen.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.380]   And he loves us, and he's trying to keep us
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.740]   from having to figure out on its own,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.180]   and so he pulls back the veil, and he reveals to us
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.640]   what we otherwise can't know in our selfishness
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.600]   and sinfulness and blindness.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.540]   Your father loves you, you ought to get to know him.
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.020]   That's what philosophy, by the way, is.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.260]   Philosophy is just men trying to figure out
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.940]   what God's already revealed.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.780]   So anyway, there was this thing that was out there
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.740]   and released, and so I just started tweeting, you know,
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.260]   and I just said a few of these things.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.100]   I said, listen, I'm officially predicting scientists
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.900]   in Springfield, Missouri, at Bass Pro Shop labs,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.280]   will soon discover that fish prosper in water.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:53.700]   And then I retweeted the article from the Israeli scientist.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.380]   I said, also just in, elementary school science teachers
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.840]   stand firm that drinking water is good for humans.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.100]   I put, breaking, dieticians confirm,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.660]   while that Oreo is definitely better tasting with milk,
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.840]   they are not better for you than milk.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.700]   And I linked to the other article.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.060]   Also breaking, the National Association of Medicine
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.720]   confirms children not removed prematurely from the womb
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.180]   by Planned Parenthood live richer and fuller lives.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.980]   And I just started putting these things that are out there.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.140]   Okay, I said, by the way, physicists at MIT
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.660]   announced that inflated basketballs
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.620]   bounce better than deflated ones.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.500]   And so I finally stopped, because like, get a life, dude.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.860]   I mean, get over it, right?
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.620]   But my point is, is I just said, look,
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.740]   there's some things that are out there.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.740]   Here's what's so crazy.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   Let me tell you what's going on with your generation.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.780]   Don't you feel stupid sometimes when you go,
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.820]   well, listen, man, I mean, I don't hate people
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.400]   that have gender dysphoria at all,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.820]   but I also don't wanna love 'em
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.760]   by sowing air into their life and telling 'em it's okay.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.280]   I said here, very famously at the porch one night,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.320]   I think Bruce Jenner was very courageous
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.700]   when he stood up and said, hey, I'm just not,
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.200]   I just, I'm confused.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.600]   I think I wanna be a woman.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.920]   That takes a lot of courage
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.240]   for somebody to raise their hand and go,
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.460]   man, I am tormented.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.880]   Something's happened to me, things are happening in me.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.240]   I look and I wanna grab feminine clothes.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.480]   I wanna present as a woman.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.060]   I wanna live as a woman.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.260]   That takes a lot of courage.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.080]   Bruce Jenner's problem was not that he confessed that.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.560]   Bruce Jenner's problem was his church.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.060]   Bruce Jenner's problem was that people didn't go,
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.700]   hey, Bruce, man, we love you, we're not afraid of that.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.560]   There's some crazy stuff that goes through my mind,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.760]   and not just through my mind, man.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.000]   Let me tell you some stuff I've grabbed
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   against all sound wisdom.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.240]   But bro, when we do what seems right to us
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.320]   and we don't listen to the good father who made us,
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.440]   and it's why, what I was gonna say to you earlier
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.400]   is that people mock you for a long time
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.920]   because you're people of faith, not people of science,
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.520]   and now when science is saying, hey, listen,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.880]   when God said he created us, male and female,
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.400]   he created us, he meant it,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.480]   and science is saying, male and female, he created you,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.680]   and we're going, well, science, science.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.080]   What matters is how people feel, what they think.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.640]   Have faith in humanity.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.920]   I'm like, oh, no, no, because when we're humans,
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.640]   we grab stuff that only we can see,
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.720]   and we've got a loving father that wants to scoop us up.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.880]   Do you guys get this?
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.800]   So guys, you've got an enemy,
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.560]   and you need to know something.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.260]   There is no secret about what's coming
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.760]   or who it's coming from, and you better know
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.960]   you are at war for your soul.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.660]   And God's not mad at you 'cause you've been grabbing.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.000]   I wasn't mad at my three-year-old.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.840]   I just go, sweetie, I love you, and you know what?
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.320]   I wouldn't, as a father who was very present in that moment,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.600]   I would've maybe let her grab it
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.560]   if it was gonna be something, if it was like,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.700]   I don't know, if it was cyanide, I would've said no.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.540]   I know, I lied.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.680]   You can't have the cyanide candy, right?
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.520]   Which begs the question,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   why is 7-Eleven selling cyanide candy?
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.880]   Which they weren't, okay?
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.640]   And so, but my point is, at some point, God just says,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.360]   go, you can have it, you can take it,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.660]   you can take that cyanide.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.000]   In fact, you can buy the final lie
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.920]   'cause this is the greatest lie.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.720]   This is why suicide's the greatest lie
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.520]   because when you live your life, your way long enough,
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.400]   you get so filled with despair, so filled with hate
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.360]   that you go, you know what I'll do?
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.880]   I'll just go to sleep forever.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.040]   I'm still in control.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.580]   But the greatest lie is that you go to sleep forever
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.840]   because death is not anything more
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.640]   than an eternally fixed beginning.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.340]   It's appointed that men should die once,
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.840]   and after this comes judgment.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.600]   And what the enemy wants to do is finalize the deal.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.560]   He hates you.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.280]   He resents the fact that he's gotta give you
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.520]   a thin layer of sugar.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.260]   He just wants to see you die.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.680]   And your father loves you, secondly.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   Not only is there no secret about what's coming
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.960]   or who it's coming from,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   there's no shame or sin in being tempted.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.640]   I've kind of already alluded to this.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.700]   You know, one of the things that,
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.460]   and I tell people all the time,
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.780]   is that I'm not gonna let you make me what I'll never be,
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.000]   which is a guy that isn't still very alive.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.500]   The Bible talks about this fact.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.360]   The Bible talks about the fact that if we say
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.460]   that we're not tempted, okay, or that we don't even sin,
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.140]   that we are liars.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.260]   Let me just show you something.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.100]   Watch this.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.300]   This is Luke chapter four, verse one.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.900]   Now watch this very closely with me.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.300]   It says, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   "returned from the Jordan and was led around
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.340]   "by the Spirit in the wilderness,
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.340]   "and then he was tempted for 40 days."
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.380]   So let's just review.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.140]   Jesus was tempted, full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.380]   being perfectly submissive to the Father.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.780]   One of the things that sometimes happens
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.940]   in a crazy, sad way is that we start to go,
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.860]   gosh, man, I can't really tell people what I'm thinking.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.380]   I can't tell people what I've done.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.380]   I can't tell people what I'm thinking.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.980]   I can't tell people what I want to do.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.060]   That's the first thing you should do.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.060]   You should walk in there and go, man,
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   I love big red candy with flames on it.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.780]   And so wisdom would just say, I'm not going in there
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.500]   until you pick me up.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.700]   There is no shame or sin in being tempted.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.100]   We have a high priest, Jesus.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.820]   He was made to live as we live.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.020]   We've got a God who doesn't just go,
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.460]   I wonder what it's like to be a human.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.180]   I wonder what it's like to not know for sure
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.340]   or see all the heavenly world.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.820]   See, he has been tempted, Hebrews 4:15.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   For we do not have a high priest
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.340]   who cannot sympathize with our weakness,
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.100]   but he has been tempted in every way as we have been.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.840]   I would tell you he's been tempted beyond how we have been.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.680]   Why do I mean that?
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.460]   Because you don't really know how strong temptation is
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.500]   if you keep giving into it.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.300]   All of us have given into temptation.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.780]   Jesus, in that little section there in Luke chapter four,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.420]   Jesus went into the wilderness for 40 days.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.800]   He didn't eat for 40 days.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.380]   There was some supernatural provision for him to live
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.060]   that he could be tempted beyond
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.700]   what we can even think humans can experience.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.420]   He knows what it's like to be tempted
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.500]   because he never relented.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.580]   When the weight of temptation is put on most of us,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.380]   we finally go, okay, okay, okay, I'll give in.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.380]   Jesus never gave in.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.500]   He never tapped out.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.380]   He said, you crank it.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.420]   You put that arm bar on me.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.740]   You go, you rip it out.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.260]   You just tear the ligaments.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.620]   I am not going to give.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.220]   That brother knows what it's like to be tempted,
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.800]   and he's not angry at you
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.660]   when you struggle in your temptation.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.120]   He just wants to help you out.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.880]   Thirdly, there's no such thing as a faithful man
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.640]   who ever surrenders to temptation.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.560]   Now look, be very careful here.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.400]   Notice I didn't say there's no such thing
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.100]   as a faithful man who doesn't sin.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.280]   We all sin.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.940]   We all need a savior.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.480]   I love to tell people,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.400]   saying that we shouldn't disobey God
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.560]   and sometimes disobeying God doesn't make us a hypocrite.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.720]   It makes us human.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.600]   Do you guys know every day I go to war,
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.040]   I can't believe that even though now for 30 years
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.880]   I've walked with Christ,
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.200]   even though I've grabbed atomic fireballs before
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   and I've had them, I spit them out,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.000]   I still am tempted by atomic fireballs in my life.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.600]   And I'm not gonna let you make me a guy
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.120]   that has to act like I'm not tempted
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.640]   because when I act like I'm not tempted,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.120]   I don't surround myself with mighty men and sisters
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.600]   who encourage me, Hebrews 3:13,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.280]   day after day as long as it's still called today.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.200]   I will become hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.960]   if I don't have you guys there to help me.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.040]   And so I'm not gonna let you make me a pastor
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.980]   who somehow cleft out of the human experience, no.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.840]   I have got to go to war just like you
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.220]   and be vigilant against sin just like you.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.280]   And I want you to know something,
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.040]   there's no such thing as a faithful man
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.220]   who surrenders to temptation.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.600]   Now watch this, hypocrites aren't people who say,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.320]   you've gotta listen to God, you've gotta love God,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.920]   and then sometimes sin.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.160]   Hypocrites are people who go, this is what God says,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.800]   this is right and this is true, except when I do it.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.480]   Then it's not sin and I don't want you
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.280]   to really talk to me about it.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.360]   We're not gonna go there.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.940]   Hey, we'll talk about that guy's sin,
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.040]   we'll talk about that little 2% of the population's
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.280]   struggle with same-sex, you know, sin.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.040]   We'll talk about the transgender people,
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.080]   which even a smaller percentage will say that's sin,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.820]   but don't you talk to me about my pride, my arrogance,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.080]   my body image infatuation, my lust for material things.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.260]   Don't you talk to me about that stuff
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.220]   because I just wanna make more money
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.460]   so I can give more money.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:39.840]   No, no, when you become an individual who says,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.100]   I'm not gonna struggle with an area of my life
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.260]   that God wants to invade and that God wants to see
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.680]   conform to the image of his son, why?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.200]   So he can give me what a man should have,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.020]   which is a right and glorious life.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.460]   God wants every area of my life to be such
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.060]   that when people look at me, they go,
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.040]   that's the way a man should love a woman,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.940]   that's the way a dad should treat children,
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.560]   that's the way a friend should treat a friend,
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.700]   that's the way a man should conduct himself
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.540]   in holiness and honor.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.000]   His speech, his conduct, his love, his faith,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.220]   and his purity, that's the way a 23-year-old
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.780]   ought to live in Dallas, Texas.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.340]   And not be sucked into the vortex
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.580]   of the atomic fireball of the Dallas way.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.560]   That is a noble person.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.460]   If more people were like that, this would be a better city.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.780]   Not some guy who just swipes until he sees what he wants
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.720]   and runs after it.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.100]   But a man who serves and loves and cherishes and honors,
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.000]   that's a man.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.140]   Where you get in trouble is not when you screw up.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.860]   When you screw up, you just go, oh my gosh,
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.180]   we gotta confess our sins to God
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.260]   so that we might be forgiven,
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.260]   and we confess to each other so we might be healed.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.140]   There are some times I do some stuff
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.600]   and I just go, God, what in the world is wrong with me?
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.280]   And I don't go to some priest to get forgiveness.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.400]   My high priest is in heaven.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.040]   If we confess our sins, he, Jesus, is faithful and just
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.820]   to forgive us our sins and cleanse us
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.240]   from all unrighteousness, 1 John 1:9.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.160]   And it says also, God, in James chapter five,
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.040]   confess your sins one to another.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.320]   Every sin that I commit affects other people.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.480]   And when I go to those people and go,
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.920]   I gotta acknowledge this is true.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.620]   God lets me experience what he wants me to experience,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.820]   which it says in Psalm three,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.020]   that our Lord, our shield around me,
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.220]   you're my glory and the lifter of my head.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.580]   And I can't tell you how many times my friends,
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.620]   my wife, my kids, go, hey, dad, we love you.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.180]   Look, dad, come here.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.860]   Yeah, you were just short right there.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.300]   You were selfish right there.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.900]   In that moment, you weren't tender.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.700]   In that moment, you weren't kind.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.460]   You're the one who taught us to memorize
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.420]   Proverbs three, three, and four.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.220]   Don't let kindness or truth leave you.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.340]   Bind it around your neck.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.740]   Write it on the tablet of your heart
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.300]   'cause that's how you're gonna have favor
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.560]   with God and men.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.660]   And dad, that wasn't kind,
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.820]   and it kinda made our family awkward,
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.720]   but come here, look, we love you, dad.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.200]   And they're the lifter of my head.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.240]   So here's the deal.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.380]   When I just go, hey, I'm dad.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.000]   Don't you ever tell me that I made a mistake.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.660]   When I'm too prideful to let guys know
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.860]   that they can't come and sharpen me
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.660]   and make me a better man still, I'm in trouble.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.440]   Don't surrender to sin in any area of your life,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.920]   and don't be surprised when we all still struggle.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.040]   Now let me just tell you something.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.600]   That doesn't mean you date guys and marry guys
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.360]   or marry girls that are consistently surrendering to sin.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   No, you gotta let them become people that are faithful.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   I tell people all the time,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.400]   don't marry somebody who's not already well married.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.680]   What do I mean by that?
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.700]   I've been married for 30 years,
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.900]   and there's still times when I'm not gracious
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.240]   towards my wife in fleeting moments.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.240]   Okay, but I'm not abusive.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.280]   I don't rail on her, and I never did.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.760]   If you've got a guy that's abusive,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.400]   if you've got a guy that says he loves God,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.680]   but he loves his flesh more,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.200]   and so he drags you physically
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   into a part of the relationship
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.440]   that you both know isn't good,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.040]   and you rationalize and justify it,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.920]   and go, that's not sin for us 'cause we love each other,
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.000]   and surely God understands.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.240]   I wouldn't hold that guy's hand
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.360]   through the candy shop of life.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   I'd say, I love you, I'm not mad at you,
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.520]   but I'm not gonna yoke with you
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.840]   until you get well married to Jesus.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.340]   That's what Jesus says to you.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.900]   Because he loves you.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.740]   Let that person grow and mature in their faith.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.740]   So we all still struggle in sin in some way,
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.260]   but there's no such thing as a faithful man
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.300]   that surrenders to it, compromises it,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.400]   or who walks away fourthly.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.740]   There's no saint beyond falling or screwing up.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:38.300]   I can remember, I have a friend,
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.860]   actually, what he does, he's a stand-up comedian,
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.340]   and he warms up audiences for live sitcoms.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:50.580]   Big Bang Theory and whatever the shows are
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.740]   that folks are watching right now,
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.260]   those sitcoms that have live audiences,
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.300]   he'd be the guy that would come in and warm 'em up,
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.380]   but he's got this amazing bit
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.340]   where he walks through the Bible.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.780]   He's an impersonator and a comedian,
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.240]   and he does different characters that you know
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.040]   from Hollywood and famous people
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.300]   that are different characters in the Bible,
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.700]   and he works his way through.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.160]   The first time I was listening to him do this,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.220]   one of the bits he did is he got to David,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.780]   all right, this amazing David,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.740]   and his bit was he stood up there,
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.020]   and he got to David, and I forget the voice he used,
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.620]   'cause the voice didn't matter, but it just made me laugh.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.980]   He goes, "Lord God, maker of heaven and earth,
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.880]   "what is it, man, that you just take note of him?
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   "You alone in great and worthy of praise.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.020]   "I will sing of your loving kindness and justice
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.100]   "from the rising of the sun in the morning
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:29.960]   "until it's setting in the,
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.080]   "who is that woman taking a bath?"
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.820]   And it just cracked me up,
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.100]   and I was actually there when he was doing this live bit,
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.940]   and he looked at me, he goes,
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.080]   "Ah, the laughter of familiarity,"
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.840]   because that's the way I feel sometimes.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.760]   I'm like, I'm this guy that just wants to love God
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.140]   and do God, I'm reading the Bible, you know?
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.880]   I'm doing weddings and whatever it is,
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.380]   and all of a sudden, thoughts cross my mind,
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.040]   I go, "Am I even saved?"
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.800]   And I'm just sitting here, and I just,
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.960]   listen, there is no saint who is beyond falling
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.940]   or screwing up, I tell you that,
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.200]   'cause the enemy's gonna accuse you,
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.120]   "You don't love God, why are you thinking that?
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.340]   "Why did you do that?"
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.320]   Answer, "Because in that moment,
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.680]   "I did not delight myself in the law of the Lord,
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.240]   "or on that law, meditate day and night."
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   And when I don't do that,
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.500]   I am anything but a tree firmly planted by,
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.060]   you know, springs of water, I'm like a weed,
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.440]   weeds grow fast.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.760]   And so, I'm just gonna tell you,
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.580]   this is why 1 Peter 5:8 says, "Be on the alert."
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.400]   You can't let that gun down for a minute,
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.960]   you're at war, and the enemy wants to take you out.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.840]   And by the way, some of you guys don't feel very tempted,
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.580]   that's probably because the enemy's not really concerned
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.980]   about you, 'cause you're not doing much for the other side.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.440]   And so, I'm just telling you, some of you guys,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.900]   "I don't really struggle with temptation, Todd."
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.140]   Okay, well, there's a reason.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.340]   Because you grab whatever has flames
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.480]   and looks attractive to you right in front.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:54.560]   So, I would just tell you, you know,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.800]   "The prudent sees evil," Proverbs 22 says,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.000]   "and hides himself, but the naive go on
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.060]   "and are punished for it."
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.880]   First Corinthians chapter 10 talks about this,
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.340]   it says this in verse one, it says,
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.520]   "I don't want you to be unaware, brethren,
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.040]   "that our fathers were all under the cloud
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.280]   "and all passed through the sea."
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.620]   They were all baptized into Moses,
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.640]   in the cloud and in the sea.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.460]   They saw this, they ate the same spiritual food,
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.960]   they drank the same spiritual drink,
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.240]   they were drinking from a spiritual rock
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.720]   which followed them, the rock was Christ.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.120]   Nevertheless, "With most of them, God was not well pleased,
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.280]   "for they were laid low in the wilderness."
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.120]   Why?
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.040]   They happened as an example for us,
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   that you can do really well for a long time
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.480]   and see all kinds of amazing things happen.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.520]   But watch this.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.020]   It says in verse seven, "The people sat down
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.360]   "to eat and drink and stood up to play.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.020]   "At some point, despite all that they saw going on,
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.060]   "they stopped being vigilant."
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.860]   And all they did is eat and drink and play.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.960]   In other words, they weren't putting on
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.920]   the helmet of salvation, the belt of truth,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.200]   the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.660]   they weren't shod in their feet in the gospel,
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.960]   standing firm in the goodness of God,
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.560]   that if he loved me and he gave himself for me,
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.000]   why wouldn't he give me every encouragement in life
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.840]   to how to live right?
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.020]   And they got lazy and they got licked.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:11.040]   You just need to know there is no special cases.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   I mean, there's no one who's beyond messing up.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.600]   Next one, there's no special cases.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.500]   This is a big one.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.240]   Sometimes the enemy wants you to go,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.600]   oh, hey, well, no one has the background that you've got.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.320]   No one's tempted the way you are, right?
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   Well, first Corinthians 10, 13 says this,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.920]   "No temptation has overtaken you,
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.320]   "but such as is common to man."
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.440]   And God is faithful.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.400]   "And will not allow you to be tempted
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.060]   "beyond that which you are able,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.780]   "and with the temptation will provide the way of escape
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.000]   "also so that you might be able to endure it."
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.840]   All of us have reasons why we think
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.640]   we don't have to be or can't be obedient.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.600]   And what we all wanna do is just go,
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.800]   surely it's okay if I don't take
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.040]   God's admonition and warning seriously.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.160]   Surely God's okay if I do this thing and he's not.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.440]   Because just a little piece of candy
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.320]   is gonna burn your mouth
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.120]   and he doesn't like his little girl's mouth being burned.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.440]   And so he's patient towards you.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.780]   He's not always severe in his discipline towards you,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.520]   but that's why sometimes you keep going back
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.580]   'cause you think you got away with it.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.600]   That's what it says in the Bible,
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.860]   Ecclesiastes chapter eight, verse 11,
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.400]   "Because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.700]   "is not executed quickly,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.000]   "because some of you grab pieces of candy
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   "with real thick layers of sweetness
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.640]   "and you keep going, this must not be a problem,
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.680]   "even though you know it's a problem,
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.460]   "you just keep going 'cause it hadn't got you yet,
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.880]   "you're not pregnant yet,
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.640]   "you don't have some disease yet.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.760]   "And so you just keep going, you just keep going,
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.380]   "looking around, wondering why it's not a problem.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.820]   "Because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.860]   "is not executed quickly,
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.240]   "therefore the hearts of men among them
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.200]   "are given fully to do evil.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.900]   "There is no special cases.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.880]   "The wages of sin is death."
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.720]   It's coming.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.200]   It's coming.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.000]   Some of you guys are like the fool
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.840]   that jumped off a 100-story building,
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.980]   mocking the law of gravity.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.700]   And you're filled with adrenaline,
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.500]   it's amazing scenery,
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.640]   people are filming you and posting on Instagram
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.000]   while you go flying down in your squirrel suit.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.140]   But it's just a matter of time
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.640]   before the reality of gravity catches up with you.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.320]   Some of us jump off two-story buildings
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.700]   and it's not long before we hit.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.360]   Others of us have jumped off a real high building
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.560]   and all I'm gonna tell you is it's just a matter of time.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.360]   Do not be deceived, God is not mocked.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.880]   There is no special case.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.800]   A man will reap what he sows.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.840]   The enemy doesn't want you to believe it.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.040]   Two more, one, there's no silver bullet.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.360]   It's just common that we're looking
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.000]   for that one conference, that one message,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.400]   that one place we can go,
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.140]   the one person we date, we marry,
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.280]   the community group that's perfect,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.040]   the church that's just awesome,
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   the podcast that will forever change our life,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.000]   and you may as well try and eat such a big meal tonight
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.240]   you never hunger again.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.760]   It's crazy.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.840]   There is no silver bullet.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.960]   In fact, when you think you've found it,
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.440]   you actually can be sure that you've lost it.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.880]   And that is why we are called to be on the alert,
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.140]   to be sober in all things,
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.100]   and to not turn aside to myth.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.580]   It is a daily battle.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:22.240]   And we are to remain vigilant and on the alert
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.600]   and stand firm.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.200]   Lastly, there's no sense in going at it alone, guys.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.760]   You gotta make sure that you don't try
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.880]   and fight your adversary alone.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.120]   That would be crazy.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.680]   The scriptures are filled with admonition.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   It says two are better than one
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.000]   because they have a good return for the labor.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.640]   If either of them falls, the other one
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.880]   will lift up his companion in Ecclesiastes chapter four.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.040]   But woe to the one who falls
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.280]   and there's not another one there to pick him up.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.160]   You gotta find friends that will sharpen you.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.000]   You gotta find friends that will smite you in kindness.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.280]   It's like oil upon your head.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.320]   It refreshes you.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.180]   There is no sense in going at it alone.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.920]   In fact, it says in Proverbs 18, one,
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.800]   he who separates himself seeks his own desire.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.240]   He quarrels against all sound wisdom.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.080]   Remember what Ali did?
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.920]   Ali came to me and said,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.440]   "Daddy, help me pick candy."
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.340]   Kirby said, "I'm gonna go my own way."
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:14.060]   There's just no sense in fighting alone.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.680]   Navy SEALs know this.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.040]   They're the most highly trained warriors in the world.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.880]   They've got a motto.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.760]   Two is one, one is none.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.820]   And God did not create you to be an orphan.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.200]   He made you to be a part of a family
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.800]   and a community that cares for you and loves you,
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.320]   that you can be encouraged day after day
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.360]   as long as it's called the day
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.300]   so you won't be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.280]   It's deceitful because it looks life-giving and it's not,
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.880]   and it's deceitful because you think
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.340]   you are gonna be able to manage it and you can't.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:46.240]   We all say, okay, I'm gonna do this,
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.180]   but I'll never go there.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.520]   There's a reason they're called gateway drugs
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.400]   because they're never enough and it won't be long before
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.360]   you're not just doing that, you're doing this
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   because when you rely on something to satisfy you
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.400]   or give you ease or give you pleasure or to numb your pain,
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.040]   it won't numb it or pleasure you long enough
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.200]   and then you want more and the only one
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.160]   that you want more of is the God
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.800]   who is life from beginning to end,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   who gives grace upon grace.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.780]   And he's not mad at you
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.900]   because you've grabbed some fireballs before.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.640]   That's who I wanna end.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   It's not a seventh point about your adversary,
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.980]   it's just a truth and that is this,
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.280]   there is no such thing as a sinner so far gone
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.680]   that they're beyond help.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.900]   I don't know what you've done before you got in here,
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.120]   but I know this, you're not dead.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   I mean, maybe you're spiritually dead,
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.440]   you haven't realized the goodness of God,
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.400]   but God wants to quicken you.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.920]   He wants to rush into you with his spirit,
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.880]   which is the life giver.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.600]   So far, the ultimate lie of the enemy,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.000]   which is the way to deal with your pain
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.280]   and have all the 13 reasons why is to just end it
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.140]   and look like you're a hero
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.940]   because you were courageous enough to show the people
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.060]   how foolish they were out there.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.340]   No, you're the fool because you've been listened to a liar
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.340]   who wants to steal, kill and destroy.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.120]   And his ultimate goal is to not give you
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.100]   any other chance to get help.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.100]   And there is a day, guys, when you're beyond help.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.540]   God offers forgiveness to your repentance.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.260]   He doesn't offer and promise tomorrow to procrastination.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.340]   And there's often a second chance, but listen to me,
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.260]   there's always a last chance.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:14.200]   But if you're here tonight, your last chance hasn't come.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.740]   You've got a chance right now.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.180]   And so there's no such thing as a sinner
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.900]   who's so far gone to beyond help.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.260]   I don't care how many fireballs you've sucked on.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.340]   I don't care how blistered your mouth is.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.540]   He is the one who makes beauty from ashes.
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.980]   He is the one who takes your sin,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.940]   though they're red as scarlet, and makes them white as snow.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.860]   He is the one who is filled with love and kindness.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.580]   He is slow to anger.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.540]   All I wanted Kirby to do was to dig
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.740]   into the bag of Skittles with us.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.860]   I want you to know I love you.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.420]   I don't want you to waste your time,
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.760]   your mouth, or your nerve endings on sin.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.100]   I want to heal you.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.320]   I want to raise you to be a woman of glory and beauty
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.960]   who grabs things that are life-giving,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.780]   and that's what your father wants for you.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.980]   And so if you're here and you're buying the lie
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.860]   that God isn't filled with love
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.520]   and isn't full of good character and his word isn't true,
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.640]   you are not on the alert.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.000]   In fact, you have been deceived.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.920]   And if you're here and the enemy's telling you
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.820]   that whatever you've done is so awful and so bad
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.200]   that God doesn't love you still,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   you're not listening to the word of God.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.940]   And I'm here to tell you he loves you.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.340]   In the same way this dad loved that little three-year-old,
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.680]   your heavenly father loves you so much more.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.520]   He wants to give you grace and glory.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.100]   But you be on the alert.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.800]   You be sober of spirit because tonight
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.720]   someone's gonna lie to you.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.920]   I sowed truth in your life tonight.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.440]   A lie's gonna come from your flesh,
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.920]   from what you watch on TV, the world,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.640]   and from the enemy, the devil.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.600]   You make sure you know the one who has dominion
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.420]   and who you will give an account to
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.020]   is your daddy who loves you.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.180]   Listen to him.
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.380]   Father, thank you for my friends
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.860]   and for the way they graciously listen to me.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.380]   Share with them what I have learned.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:00.020]   Oh, would you give them the wisdom, Lord,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.860]   just to be subject to me in this moment
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.580]   because I'm just sharing with them your heart.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.700]   I don't want them to listen to me.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   I want them to listen to you.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.140]   I want them to see your beauty and your goodness.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.900]   I want them to know that you are a sun and a shield,
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.060]   that you give grace and you give glory,
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:20.580]   that in your right hand is fullness of joy
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.940]   and in your presence are pleasures forever.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.460]   That's your words.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.780]   And oh, Lord, thank you that you've shown me that it's true.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.360]   Thank you that there's a bunch of my 20-something friends
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.420]   in this room that know it's true.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.780]   And we just wanna say, listen to dad, man.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.380]   He knows where life is.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.900]   Let him pick you up.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.420]   Don't swipe right.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:45.140]   Get on your knees, submit to him
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.720]   because he will pick you up and he will restore to you
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.980]   the years the locusts have eaten.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.840]   He will make you pure and holy again.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.380]   Father, I thank you that you've restored taste buds
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.180]   in my mouth that I have burned with foolish choices.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.480]   And I pray tonight there might be somebody here
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.900]   who learns of your goodness
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.420]   and others who knew it when they came in
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.340]   that will walk out of here more committed
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.500]   to holding your hand.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.240]   In Jesus' name, amen.
