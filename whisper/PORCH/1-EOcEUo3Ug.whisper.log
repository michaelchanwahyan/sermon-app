[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:32.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.560]   All right, it is so good to be at the porch.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.160]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.360]   For all my Aggies in here, let me just say, howdy.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   All right.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.640]   You guys travel strong.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.840]   Thanks for doing that.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.780]   I do want to say hello to everyone watching
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.520]   in the other rooms and to all the different Porch Live
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.800]   sites.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   It's so good to get to spend a little time with you tonight.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.160]   I love JD.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.000]   I love David.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.720]   I love the ministry of the porch.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.760]   So it's great to see you.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.840]   I want to start tonight just by sharing with you
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.360]   how I proposed to my wife.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.800]   There are some people in the room
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.720]   who love a good proposal story.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.160]   And others of you would probably rather leave right now.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.120]   I understand.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.560]   So let me just say, ladies, you're
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.200]   like hardwired to enjoy good engagement stories.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.840]   So as I'm talking, your body is going to be doing something
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840]   involuntarily.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400]   Aw, you just go with it.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.200]   Don't fight it.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.360]   That's what you were made to do.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920]   Men, while the women are emotionally vomiting,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160]   you might just be vomiting.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.080]   And that's OK.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.880]   But here's what I would encourage you to do.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.720]   Take notes on this story.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.520]   Go and find a girl outside of this room.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.160]   Claim it all as your own.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.120]   All I ask is that you DM me and credit me
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.360]   as a romantic genius.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.280]   Anyway, so here's how I proposed to my wife, Catherine.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.320]   Several years ago, I was living in Dallas.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.400]   She was living in--
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.320]   let me change that.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.520]   I was living in Austin.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.240]   She was living in Dallas.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.560]   It was that long ago, people.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.960]   But we would travel on the weekends to see each other.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.040]   And so I convinced her on this weekend
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.680]   that she was going to be flying from Austin, or from Dallas
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.760]   to Austin to visit me.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.160]   I convinced her of this by buying her a fully refundable
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400]   ticket on southwest.com.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.280]   I sent her the e-confirmation, and then I got my money back.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.600]   So without her knowing, she thought
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.080]   she was going to fly on a Friday.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.240]   On a Thursday before the Friday, I
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   made my way to Dallas without her knowing.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   And then during the day on Friday,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   I made my way up to her work.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.600]   And I was in cahoots with her boss and her co-workers.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.800]   And they lured Catherine away from her desk,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   got into her purse, grabbed her keys,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.200]   came outside, unlocked her car.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.400]   All the while, Catherine had no clue
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.960]   she was about to get punked.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.000]   So what I did was I got into her car,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and I put two dozen roses.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240]   I sprinkled the whole car with rose petals.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   And then in the seat, I put a note that says,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.520]   change of plans.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.480]   Tonight is a very important night
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.920]   in the history of our relationship.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.440]   Go home, and then you'll get further instruction.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   So Catherine comes out of her work
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.320]   thinking that she's going to get in her car
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.360]   to drive to the airport.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.800]   And instead, she finds that blissful love
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   has exploded all over the inside of her car.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.360]   So she makes her way back to her apartment,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560]   where I have already been.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   And she opens the door,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.680]   and there is a trail of rose petals
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.800]   from the front door all the way into the bedroom.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.600]   And there on the bed was me.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.480]   Not really, okay, just making sure that you,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.640]   sorry, highly inappropriate.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.460]   Anyway, there on the bed, my apologies.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.040]   There on the bed was two dozen more roses,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.280]   a dress that I had bought for Catherine,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.840]   and a note that said, see you at six.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.040]   Now, ladies, I know what you're thinking.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.720]   You're like, you bought a dress for her?
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   That is super dangerous, because what if it doesn't fit?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.880]   Deal breaker right there.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.240]   Fortunately, Catherine has a twin sister,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   so it was like, will this fit Catherine?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.380]   Yes, great, good, got it.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.840]   Six p.m., she comes out of her apartment,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   where I am waiting in front of a limousine
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.960]   holding two dozen more roses.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.840]   We get into the limo, we make our way to downtown Dallas.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.400]   And then we go and eat dinner on the 39th floor
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   of the downtown Dallas skyscraper
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.840]   that has the hole in the middle of it.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   And so we sit in the restaurant right below that hole,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.840]   and we're watching the sunset,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.000]   and then right there in the middle of the sunset,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.960]   as we're eating dinner, I look at Catherine,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.000]   I take her by the hand, I say,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.400]   Catherine, will you pass the sweet and low?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.120]   And she did, and I appreciated that.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.480]   So we finished up dinner, we hopped back in the limo,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.980]   and then we made our way to my cousin's backyard.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.000]   Now, I know what you're thinking.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.440]   Er, swerve, like who goes to their cousin's backyard
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.520]   when they're proposing?
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.920]   Well, this guy does.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.880]   Why?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.240]   Because my cousin shared a backyard
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.000]   with former Dallas Cowboy football player,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.720]   Darryl Johnson, aka The Moose.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   And The Moose had this beautiful private lake
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.760]   with fountains and waterfalls.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240]   And so I walked Catherine up the driveway
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.000]   where I had a projection screen set up,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   and I sat her down, I pushed play,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.660]   and I showed her a slideshow of the two of us
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.880]   from birth to present.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.520]   She cried, I said, bam.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   And so she watched the slideshow,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.160]   and after she finished the slideshow,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   I took her by the hand, and I walked her down to the lake.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.600]   It was very dark, but it was lit by candles,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.000]   and the water was dark, but there was floating candles
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.480]   in the lake, and there in the lake was a rowboat.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.440]   And so I put Catherine in the rowboat,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.080]   there were two dozen, more roses,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.520]   true story, people, put her in the rowboat.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.760]   I'm not really great at rowboats, but I put her in it,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.760]   and I proceeded to row the two of us
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.400]   out to the middle of this lake.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.120]   And there, in the middle of the lake,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.580]   I got down on one knee, and I told Catherine
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.400]   that I loved her for the very first time
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   in our relationship, 'cause I didn't wanna say it
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.200]   'til I could put a ring on it, you know what I mean?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.360]   So I told her that I loved her for the very first time,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.160]   and then I asked her this question,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.600]   I said, will you marry me?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.980]   And she said yes, and that was a pretty good thing.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.160]   So after she said yes, there was some PDA,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.180]   and we hugged it out.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.440]   And then as we were in that rowboat, I said,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.020]   well, I wanna get you in the light
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.480]   so that you can see your ring,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.240]   and so I rowed the two of us back to the shore,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.720]   and I said, let's go knock on my cousin's door,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   and that way you can see your ring in the light,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.400]   and the door opened, and there was her family.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.860]   And estrogen just exploded in that moment.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.400]   And then 10 seconds later, 20 of her closest friends
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.840]   coming running around the corner,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.200]   more estrogen just flying all over the place.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.340]   I feel highly uncomfortable in this moment.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.480]   And then we go outside, and we spend the rest
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.020]   of the evening celebrating the fact
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.320]   that a girl like that would say yes to a dude like this.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.600]   That's all I wanted to share with you tonight.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.720]   Let's pray and get out of here.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.520]   Okay, no, just joking.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   [audience applauding]
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.960]   It's an incredible night.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.760]   I love that night, and I love sharing our story.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.460]   Many of you guys have your own stories.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.240]   I love sharing our story, but as I think back to that night,
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   and I think back to Catherine's yes,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.200]   here's the realization that I have.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.600]   In that moment, Catherine wasn't just saying yes
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.520]   to a wedding.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.000]   She was saying yes to so much more.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.800]   That one yes was actually a countless number of yeses.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.320]   In that moment, what she was saying yes to
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.240]   was she was saying yes to traveling really hard
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.800]   all over this nation into different cool parts
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.680]   of the world during our first year of marriage.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.880]   She was saying yes to binging the office
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.180]   for our third time now.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.180]   She was saying yes to having three crazy boys with me.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.960]   She was saying yes to moving to Austin
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.880]   to share Jesus with high school students,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.320]   and then to Waco to share Jesus with college students.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.120]   And then she was saying yes to moving to College Station
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.200]   to share Jesus with college students
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.760]   at Texas A&M University.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   She was saying yes to so many great things.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.840]   But in that moment, she was also saying yes
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.720]   to walking through a miscarriage.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.080]   She was saying yes to sitting in a marriage counselor's
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.020]   office just a year ago because marriage was just tougher
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.640]   than we wanted it to be.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.740]   See, what I'm trying to tell you is I'm trying to state
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.240]   the obvious, but behind that yes,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.980]   that yes wasn't just for a wedding
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.680]   because behind every wedding is a marriage.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.560]   And we need to talk about marriage tonight
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   because here's the reality.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.720]   Some of you guys, you came here ready to talk about marriage
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.760]   because you wanna be married.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.660]   Like that whole ring by spring thing,
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.600]   you're like, God, please not another spring without a ring.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.160]   [congregation laughing]
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.960]   But then there's some of you guys here and you're like,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   you know what, I'm gonna be a bachelor to the rapture
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.720]   and that's kind of your deal right now.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.080]   And so you're really not into this marriage conversation,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   but statistics would show at least the majority of people
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.560]   sitting in this room are at least open
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.920]   to the idea of marriage.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.740]   And so if you're open to the idea of marriage,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.940]   I just want you to think,
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.520]   don't you envision having a good marriage?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.900]   Like no girl here is getting together with their gal pals,
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.240]   I don't know what y'all call each other,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.960]   but no girl gets here with their group and they're like,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.400]   I cannot wait to be married,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.920]   my husband and I are going to fight all the time.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.280]   And no guy is like,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.720]   I will want to get out of my marriage often.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.740]   Like no one says that right now.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.980]   And yet when you look at different marriages in the world,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.940]   you know what you see time and time again
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.580]   is you see people's dreams and people's reality
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.340]   going in two totally different directions.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.180]   And so here's what I want to try and do tonight,
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.900]   I want to try and save your marriage before it even begins.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.020]   That's my goal tonight.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.180]   My goal tonight is to save your marriage
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.540]   before it even begins.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.780]   And I'm gonna do it by unpacking for you
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.340]   the ultimate point and purpose of marriage.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.780]   What I'm really explaining to you
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.020]   is why marriage even exists.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.860]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.180]   I want you to turn with me tonight to Genesis chapter two.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.840]   Genesis chapter two is where we're going to be tonight.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:04.220]   Genesis chapter two is the origination of marriage.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.100]   And I love that because marriage is God's invention.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   It is an overflow from the creative genius that is God.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.540]   And the fact that God put marriage
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.160]   on page two of his Bible,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.540]   it shows us just how passionate he is about marriage.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.540]   It shows us how much, how pro-marriage God truly is.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.620]   But what we need to do is we need to align our hearts
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.020]   with God's heart for marriage.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.820]   If you really want to save your marriage starting now,
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.860]   the best thing you can do is sync up
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.060]   with God's heart for marriage.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.620]   And so let's just walk through it.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.620]   This is the account of the creation of marriage.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.220]   It starts in Genesis chapter two, verse 18.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.100]   It starts with these simple words.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.460]   This is picturing Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.760]   Eve has not been created yet.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.160]   Adam's in the garden by himself.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.580]   Verse 18, "Then the Lord God said,
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.920]   "It is not good that the man should be alone."
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.640]   That's where we have to start is God looks
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.460]   at Adam's isolation in the Garden of Eden.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.300]   What does he say?
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.740]   He says, "It is not good for a man to be alone."
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.020]   Now let's just get some background on this statement
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.620]   because this is extremely important.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.900]   Don't miss it.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.620]   Genesis chapter one is the account
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.340]   of God creating the heavens and the earth.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.740]   And God slipped into this rhythm when he created.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.960]   He would speak, he would say, "Let there be."
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.220]   Let there be light, let there be oceans,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.380]   let there be animals, whatever.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.860]   He would say, "Let there be."
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.980]   He would speak, something would come into existence,
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.300]   and then he would step back, observe it, and call it good.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.500]   He says that six or seven different times
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.300]   in just chapter one, God deems what he has made good.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.860]   The reason I tell you that is verse 18 in chapter two,
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.700]   it's the first time in the Bible
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.580]   that we see something being not good.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.480]   It's the first time that God declares
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.780]   that in his creation, something is not good.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.740]   He says, "It is not good for man to be alone."
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.140]   Why is it not good for man to be alone?
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.420]   Okay, we need to get some background here,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.940]   and I need you to track with me
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.800]   because what I'm talking about right now
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   is extremely crucial to the entire understanding of marriage.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.580]   The reason that God says it's not good for man to be alone
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.220]   is because of what we find in Genesis chapter one,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.140]   verses 26 and 27, what does it say?
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.460]   It says, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.580]   "'after our likeness, and let them have dominion
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.340]   "'over the fish of the sea and over the birds
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.580]   "'of the heavens and over the livestock
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.980]   "'and over all the earth and over every creeping thing
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.440]   "'that creeps on the earth.'
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.300]   "So God created man in his own image.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.900]   "In the image of God, he created a male and female.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.960]   "He created them."
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.280]   So here's what this tells us.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.760]   God created men and women in his image.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.260]   Well, what does that mean?
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.480]   It means that God created us with the responsibility
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.600]   of imaging him on the earth.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.440]   What I'm talking about right now
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.480]   is the point and purpose of your existence.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.840]   Do you wanna know why you exist?
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   You exist to represent and reflect God on the earth.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.520]   We exist to show God off on the earth.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.280]   That is why God made us.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.560]   So I just wanna be clear, I am drilling down right now
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.200]   to why you even are breathing right now.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.120]   And for some of you, that's really important
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.800]   because you've been questioning the point of your life.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.840]   Like you haven't figured out
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.720]   what you're supposed to do with your life yet,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.280]   and you've begun to wonder what's the point anyway.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.680]   And you've thought about checking out.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.440]   Well, let me just put it this way, okay?
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.040]   You exist to know Jesus and make Jesus known.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   That's the point and purpose of your life.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.560]   You exist to put Jesus on display to the world.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.320]   I'll demonstrate it like this.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.720]   I'm holding my iPhone right now.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.040]   Think about this.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.120]   Why does the iPhone exist?
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.040]   The iPhone exists to put the world at your fingertips,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   right?
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.880]   It does.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.720]   Like you can FaceTime with anyone on the planet
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.780]   at any time face to face.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.080]   You can get a date without leaving your room.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.880]   Like one swipe can change your life.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.940]   I'm not encouraging that.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.320]   I'm just saying that's a reality.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.600]   Now, you can live as if the iPhone exists
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.960]   for a different purpose, right?
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.480]   Like you can buy an iPhone,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.000]   you can put it on your coffee table and be like,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.640]   this is an incredible coaster.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.040]   Have you ever tried using your iPhone as a coaster?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.480]   It works, especially if you have an OtterBox.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.460]   It is so effective.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.600]   Or you can be like, you know what?
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.720]   This table's a little wobbly.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.400]   You can take it, you can jam it under the leg
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.640]   and be like, man, thank goodness I bought this iPhone
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.260]   because it is great at leveling tables.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.440]   You can live as if the iPhone exists
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.480]   to be a coaster or to steady a table,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.200]   but it doesn't change the fact that the iPhone
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.640]   is most fully functioning and most fully alive
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.440]   when it is fulfilling the purpose
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.560]   for which it has been created, which is what?
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.000]   Which is to put the world at your fingertips.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.900]   It's the same thing with you.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.960]   I am telling you right now the point and purpose
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   of your life.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.140]   Your life exists.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.880]   The point of your life is to point people to Christ.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.520]   The point of your life is to put God on display
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.560]   to the world.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.840]   Now, you can live as if you exist for a different purpose.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.160]   You can live as if you exist to make tons of money.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.880]   You can live as if you exist to get a ring on your finger.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.120]   You can live as if you exist to have multiple homes
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.760]   to travel to, but it doesn't change the fact
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.440]   that you will be most fully functioning
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.680]   and most fully alive when you are fulfilling the purpose
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.480]   for which you have been created, okay?
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.900]   I need you to understand that
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.920]   because that is foundational tonight.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   God looks at Adam and says,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.720]   it is not good for man to be alone.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.560]   Why?
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   Because his responsibility was to image God on the earth.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.640]   Well, God's a relational God.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.080]   It's this theological concept called the Trinity
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.060]   where there's God the Father, God the Son,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.060]   God the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.040]   There's three, but there's only one God.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.460]   It's three co-equal, co-eternal persons
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.640]   that exist in one essence.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.080]   So at the core of who God is
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.400]   are deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.840]   So God looks at Adam's isolation
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   and he says, it's not good for man to be alone.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.040]   Why?
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.000]   Because the image of God through Adam's life
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.560]   was being distorted by Adam's isolation.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.960]   Adam was incapable of reflecting God
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.400]   as God was meant to be reflected
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.960]   because he could not reflect the relational nature
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.560]   of God throughout the earth.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.000]   Enter Eve.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.520]   So watch what God does.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.520]   Verse 18, "Then the Lord God said,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.680]   "It is not good that the man should be alone.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.360]   "I will make him a helper fit for him."
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.880]   And so ladies, this is where you come in.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.900]   And I just want you to understand what's going on here.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.280]   God decides to make Adam a helper.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.840]   That word in the Hebrew,
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.480]   which is the original language of the Old Testament,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.640]   that word Hebrew, not Hebrew, Hebrew is the language,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   the word helper, it is used 19 times in the Old Testament.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.660]   16 of those times it is referring to God.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.480]   And so helper here is not demeaning at all.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   It actually gives incredible value to the woman.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.960]   He says, I will make a helper fit for him in the Hebrew.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.820]   That literally means like, opposite.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.480]   So what God is basically saying is,
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.320]   Adam, you don't need a clone.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.400]   You need a compliment.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.700]   God's looking at Adam and he's saying,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.160]   you know what, Adam, you're great,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.400]   but there's ways that I've wired you
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.560]   where you're not gonna be able to accomplish
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.040]   all that I've made you to do without the woman.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.180]   And I'm making the woman in a unique and creative way.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.880]   She won't be able to accomplish all
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.200]   that I've called her to do without the man.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.580]   And so Adam, I'm gonna make a woman
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.500]   that is less like you, but more like me.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.600]   And together, y'all's responsibility will be
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.920]   to be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   Their responsibility together,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.760]   it wasn't just Adam's responsibility,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.580]   but Adam and Eve together would live on mission
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.340]   as a married couple to spread God's kingdom
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.780]   throughout the earth, which is pretty incredible.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.480]   Now, watch how it plays out.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   Here we go.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.640]   Now, so here's how God went to work.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.200]   Verse 19, now, out of the ground,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.420]   the Lord God had formed every beast of the field
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.120]   and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.640]   to see what he would call them.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.820]   And whatever the man called every living creature,
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.080]   that was its name.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.520]   The man gave names to all the livestock
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.620]   and to the birds of the heavens
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.040]   and to every beast of the field,
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.140]   but for Adam, there was not found a helper fit for him.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.920]   And so this is interesting because God parades
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   all the animals in front of Adam,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.900]   and we are meant to feel his loneliness.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.160]   One commentator pictured Adam saying,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   "Every animal has a partner, but I have no partner."
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.520]   It's like watching everyone go with their date to the dance,
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.920]   but he's flying stack.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:10.320]   We are meant to just feel the feeling of loneliness
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.200]   as all of these animals are, I was gonna say hooking up,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.000]   but that just was not the right wording,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.640]   just walking together, and yet Adam, I'm so sorry,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.880]   Adam is there by himself.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.840]   Now, this is where it gets really good.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.000]   Verse 21, so the Lord God caused a deep sleep
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.760]   to fall upon the man, and while he slept,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.600]   And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.360]   he made, that's a key word there,
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.720]   This is awesome because that word made,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.420]   it's the Hebrew word banah, which literally means built.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.820]   So God built Eve, everything else in creation,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.500]   everything in this world that captivates us
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.140]   with its majesty, all the oceans, all of the mountains,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.640]   God simply spoke and they came into being,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.880]   but when it came to creating the woman he built,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.920]   he used his hands, you know what that means?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.640]   It means nothing else in all of creation
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.020]   got more of God's attention and creative energy
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.240]   than the woman and the relationship between a man
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.720]   and a woman in marriage.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.540]   Now, did you see the wording?
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.640]   God built Adam and then it says
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.240]   that God brought her to the man.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   So this is what I need you to understand real quick, okay?
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.920]   When you get engaged or when you get married,
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.820]   you're gonna be hanging out with a couple of friends
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.080]   and here's the question you're gonna get asked a lot.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   The question you're gonna get asked a lot is,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.720]   "Hey, how'd you guys meet?"
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.040]   And when that question gets asked,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.000]   here's what you and your spouse are gonna do,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.920]   it's like somebody just,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.320]   when that question gets asked,
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.640]   you and your spouse are gonna lock eyes with each other
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.440]   and you're gonna look at each other like,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.240]   "We're about to change these people's lives
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.360]   "and they don't even know it yet."
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.480]   And then y'all are gonna start this back and forth
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.460]   like, "Do you wanna tell it?
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.560]   "No, no, no, it's an it, like it is that important.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.400]   "Do you wanna tell it?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.860]   "No, I like how you tell it.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.600]   "Well, do you wanna, well, okay, well, I'll tell it."
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's gonna be this back and forth.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.920]   Just a side note, if it takes longer than three minutes
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.400]   to tell, people begin to regret asking.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.880]   I'm just lovingly telling you that's a word from a friend.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   But of all of the stories of how we met
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.380]   that exist in this world,
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.720]   no one has a better story than Adam, right?
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.860]   Hey, Adam, I'd love to know, how did you and Eve meet?
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.120]   Well, God introduced us.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.440]   Okay, super Jesus juke, Adam.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.640]   Okay, we get it.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.960]   God introduced me to Catherine too.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.000]   No, for real, God introduced us.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.460]   See, I was the only man on the planet at the time.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.680]   [audience laughing]
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.800]   So God put me to sleep.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.040]   He took one of my ribs.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   He invented a woman.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.680]   He brought her to me.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.120]   We were both naked and the rest is history.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.860]   That's a pretty great story.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.920]   It's the best story of how we met in the world.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.980]   And watch Adam's response.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.080]   This is pretty great.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.200]   Verse 23, "Then the man said, 'This is at last,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.480]   "'bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.120]   "'She shall be called woman
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.800]   "'because she was taken out of the man.'"
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.120]   Do you know what that is?
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.480]   That's poetry.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.720]   So Adam meets a woman for the first time
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.760]   and the dude just bursts out into poetry.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.600]   So men, here's the deal.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.800]   If you're writing poetry for a girl,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.120]   you might as well put a ring on it 'cause you're in love.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.940]   That's a joke.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.780]   Please don't do that.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.760]   Don't be like Goham,
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.640]   like I'm gonna write some poetry tonight
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.000]   and I'm gonna propose tomorrow.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.120]   That's, he said to do it.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.480]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.040]   But this is a guy in love.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.940]   That's the power of love.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.560]   He is speaking poetry.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.360]   And then verse 24, here's the climax.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.140]   "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.060]   "and hold fast to his wife
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.540]   "and they shall become one flesh.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.500]   "And the man and his wife were both naked
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.400]   "and were not ashamed."
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.240]   This is it.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.600]   This is the invention of marriage.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.000]   A man will leave his father and his mother
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.560]   and be joined to his wife
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.600]   and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.980]   I want you to think about this.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.880]   God had options.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.160]   He could have just given Adam more animals.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.640]   He could have cloned Adam
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.040]   and he could have just bro-ed out with a bunch of Adams.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.440]   [congregation laughing]
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   But what does he do?
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.400]   He creates a woman with a heart,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.780]   with a mind, with a soul,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.480]   with a body that fits perfectly with the man,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.580]   emotionally, spiritually, and physically.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.560]   And the wording is very interesting.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.040]   What does it say?
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.440]   In the ESV it says therefore,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.440]   but in other translations it says for this reason,
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.240]   which begs the question, for what reason?
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   For what reason will a man leave his father and mother
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.560]   and be joined to his wife?
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.000]   Well, for this reason,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.200]   because it's not good for a man to be alone.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.600]   But why isn't it good for a man to be alone?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.000]   Because men and women exist
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.240]   to put the beauty of Jesus Christ on display in the world.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.520]   In isolation, Adam was incapable of fulfilling the purpose
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.920]   for which he was created,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   which was to put the beauty of Christ on display.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.180]   So here's what that means.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.300]   Why does marriage exist?
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.440]   Ultimately, marriage exists
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   to put the beauty of Jesus Christ on display to the world.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.380]   That's it.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.880]   That is why marriage exists.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   It's for two people who were created
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.400]   to image God on the earth,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.560]   to come together and image God
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.120]   in an even different and great way.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.880]   That is why marriage exists.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.220]   I don't know if you realize this,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.480]   but marriage is actually the clearest picture
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.920]   we have of understanding God.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.880]   If God is a triune God,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   which means he is three persons that exist in one essence,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.300]   a lot of people try and explain the Trinity
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.840]   by looking at an apple
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.740]   or looking at how water can be water and a gas and a solid.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.720]   All of those fall short.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.760]   The best picture we have of God is marriage,
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   where two equal people become one in essence in God's eyes.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.400]   That is why marriage exists.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.160]   Marriage exists to point to Jesus Christ.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.940]   Let me put it this way.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.320]   Your story of how you guys met
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.800]   and how God brought you together,
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   your story exists to point to an even greater story.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.800]   It's the story of Christ's love for his bride
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.200]   who is the church, not the building that we're in,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.080]   but the people of God.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.380]   Your story exists to point people
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.640]   to the greater story of Jesus's love for the church.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.960]   So when you're married
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.760]   and you selflessly serve your spouse,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.440]   anytime you selflessly serve your spouse,
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.280]   you know what you're doing?
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.880]   You're pointing to Jesus's selflessness
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.320]   when he laid down his life for you and for me on the cross,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.720]   when he voluntarily sacrificed his life on the cross
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   for our sins, you point to that selflessness.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.480]   During the times in life when marriage is tough
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   and you don't feel in love and it feels easier to run,
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.080]   but you stay in it and you work for it
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.400]   and you choose to love and you're faithful,
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.080]   you know what you're doing is you're pointing
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.020]   to the faithfulness of Jesus Christ
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.680]   who will never leave us or forsake us.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.280]   Nothing can separate us from his great love.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.960]   And in the moments where everything is as it should be,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.020]   when the laughter is rich
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.120]   and you share great meals together and sex is enjoyable,
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.040]   in all of those times when everything is as it should be
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.320]   and you give glory and praise to God,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   you point the world to how good and great your God truly is.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.480]   See, this is the point of marriage.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.000]   So let's just be clear,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.440]   marriage doesn't exist first and foremost
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.000]   for your happiness.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.440]   Marriage doesn't exist first and foremost for companionship.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   Marriage doesn't exist for you to have guiltless sex.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.560]   Marriage exists for you to put the beauty of Jesus Christ
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.400]   on display to the world.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.760]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.280]   And if you wanna save your marriage
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   before it ever begins, intermarriage with that mentality,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:34.040]   that it is a marriage on mission.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.200]   Here's what I wanna do just with the remainder of my time
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.360]   and these will go quick.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.140]   So please listen closely.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.960]   I wanna just give you eight keys
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.880]   to saving your marriage before it begins.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.260]   So let's just get real practical.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.020]   The first is this marriage has a mission.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.220]   Marriage has a mission.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.920]   What is it?
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.800]   I've said it multiple times.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.480]   The point of your future marriage
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.440]   will be to point to Jesus Christ.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.520]   It will be to put his love on display to the world.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.880]   Your marriage has a mission.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.520]   I often tell people in premarital counseling,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.360]   your greatest ministry will be through your marriage.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.680]   And my hope is my greatest ministry during my lifetime,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.840]   my hope is that it will be through my marriage.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.400]   Even though I speak to a lot of people each week,
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.860]   my hope is that my greatest ministry
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.100]   will be through my marriage.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.940]   Why?
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.840]   Because I've only made a covenant
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.120]   in this world with my wife.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.920]   I haven't made a covenant to my kids,
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.040]   even though I love my kids.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.960]   I haven't made a covenant to break away,
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.120]   even though I love break away.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.000]   I have only made a covenant to my wife.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.460]   And so I want our marriage to be our greatest ministry.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.480]   Now, let me just say this.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.440]   Some of you guys are not gonna wanna hear this,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.600]   but let me just lovingly tell you,
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.320]   here's the problem with a Christian marrying someone
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.720]   who isn't a Christian.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.020]   The problem is that when a Christian marries someone
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.080]   who's not a Christian, instead of your mission
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.720]   being the world, your mission becomes your spouse.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.560]   And so if you're contemplating marrying an unbeliever,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.360]   I wanna put a question, kind of like a pebble in your shoe.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.760]   You need to decide, do you wanna spend your marriage
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   praying with your spouse or praying for your spouse?
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.720]   Because those are two totally different experiences.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.820]   Your marriage has a mission.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.740]   The second thing that will save your marriage
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.560]   before it begins is this, just realize single and lonely
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.280]   is better than married and lonely.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.120]   I promise you, single and lonely
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.400]   is better than married and lonely.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.560]   There is a marriage after your wedding.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.160]   And so please, all eyes on me,
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.120]   don't miss what I'm about to tell you.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.280]   Marriage does not solve your problems,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.080]   it intensifies your problems.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.900]   So if there's red flags in the relationship right now,
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.080]   I promise you they will not magically disappear
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   when you get married, okay?
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.380]   Marriage doesn't solve problems,
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.860]   it intensifies your problems.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.800]   Do not marry anyone for who you hope that they become.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.260]   Some of y'all are in relationships right now
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.460]   that you shouldn't be in, why?
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.440]   Because everyone around you is telling you
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.800]   this is not the right relationship for you to be in,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.240]   but you're buying into what I like to call Acon theology.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.120]   I don't know if you remember Acon,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.540]   but Acon has a song where he says this, he says,
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.520]   ♪ Nobody wanna see us together ♪
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.120]   ♪ But it don't matter, no ♪
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.480]   ♪ I got you ♪
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.700]   No, it does matter.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.260]   If no one wants to see you together,
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.820]   you should probably not be together.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.280]   And for you to just move forward hoping for the best
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.960]   will put you in a world of hurt.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.820]   You can't imagine how many lonely married people
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.400]   there are in this world.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   No one is better than the wrong one, I assure you of that.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.060]   The third thing is this, cultivate your character.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.280]   From now, cultivate your character.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.700]   Let me explain it this way.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.040]   A few years ago, my wife and I,
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.980]   we love to go to New York at Christmas time,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.700]   and so we always take a selfie in front of the tree.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.500]   Well, probably five years ago,
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.720]   we were taking a selfie in front of, you know,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.460]   tree at Rockefeller Center,
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.060]   and we did the thing where you take the selfie
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.540]   and then you automatically, instantly
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.100]   wanna look at how the picture came out.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.760]   And we both have the same reaction.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.100]   Like we both smile, we took the picture.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.260]   We're like, we crushed it.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.860]   And then we look and we're like,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.900]   we are officially too old for selfies.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.620]   Like they're too up close.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.540]   Like I was like, look at those wrinkles around my eyes.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.460]   Like I thought I was like this, I turned out like this.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.780]   I don't understand, like what happened?
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.620]   And it was just a reminder that time is not on the side
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.180]   of external beauty, it's not.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.780]   So the further you get into marriage,
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.660]   you're gonna need your character
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.940]   to facilitate the attraction between you and your spouse.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.040]   I assure you of that.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.660]   But let's just be clear, it is possible to live a double life
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.660]   where you have this external public persona,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.600]   but then you have this private reality.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.660]   Your spouse is the one who will be most acquainted
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.580]   with that private reality.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:50.080]   And if there is compromise in your character,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.240]   I promise you it will strain your marriage,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.140]   cultivate your character.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.900]   Now, if you have roommates, then ask your roommates
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.640]   to help you prepare for your lifelong roommate.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.980]   And just ask them, are there any cracks in my character?
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.620]   Here's just some good questions for you to ask yourself.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.620]   Do you smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.500]   Good question to ask.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.660]   And the way that you talk,
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.500]   and the way that you act on the weekends,
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.540]   when you go out after work for happy hour,
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.480]   do you smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.720]   Do you smell of more of faithfulness or flakiness?
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.160]   Can people count on you?
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.560]   Are you where you tell people you're going to be?
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.800]   Do you show up?
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.320]   Do you leave people stranded?
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.400]   If so, deal with it.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.340]   Grow, pursue faithfulness.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.180]   What about this?
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:54.080]   Do you smell of selfishness or selflessness?
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.400]   Does drama follow you around?
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.220]   Does all of your time with your group of friends
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.780]   revolve around you?
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.820]   Is it always you dumping all of your problems
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.220]   upon your friends?
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.920]   That's okay, it's just good to realize that though,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.560]   and grow, cultivate your character.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.860]   Here's the next thing.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.960]   Comparison kills closeness.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.600]   Here's the problem with getting married
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.180]   in a social media age,
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.420]   because we compare like we breathe.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.920]   We compare ourselves to other people's lives all the time.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.120]   Some of you are wildly unhappy,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.640]   and at the root of your unhappiness,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.240]   I promise you, it's comparison.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.320]   Because you're consistently comparing
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.160]   your unfiltered life to other people's filtered feeds,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.300]   and it drives you crazy.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.000]   But man, comparison is toxic to a marriage,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.560]   because you're going to get into marriage,
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.440]   and you're going to begin to look at what he and she
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.040]   are doing, and what that couple is like,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.260]   and where they're traveling to,
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.040]   and how much money they have,
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.320]   and how much more in shape he is than you're he.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.840]   You're going to be comparing,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.480]   and comparison kills closeness.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.800]   Because you know what comparison does?
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   It demands that your spouse competes for your affection.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:25.780]   And let me just say this,
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.080]   I want to talk for a moment about pornography,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.160]   because if statistics are right,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.880]   there is plenty of men and women watching right now
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.100]   who struggle with pornography.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.460]   Six in 10 seek it out at least monthly.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.460]   Pornography, it cultivates the demand for novelty.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:59.880]   And so what pornography does,
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.880]   is it invites perpetual comparison into your marriage.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.960]   And while you're comparing,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.640]   your spouse is competing for your affection,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.860]   for your attention, for your attraction.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.600]   So let me just tell you how things can unravel
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.820]   because of comparison.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.400]   Comparison leads to competition,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.640]   competition fuels insecurity,
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   insecurity leads to anger,
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.300]   anger leads to distress,
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.320]   distress leads to withdrawal,
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.120]   withdrawal leads to separation,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.880]   separation leads to divorce.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.320]   Comparison kills closeness.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.200]   Next thing is this,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.380]   love has no caveats.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.880]   I learned this best from Todd Wagner.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.680]   Love has no caveats,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.560]   so one day you're going to stand on an altar
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.320]   and you're going to share vows.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.080]   I so and so take you so and so to be my wife
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.260]   or to be my husband,
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.280]   to have and to hold from this day forward
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.360]   for better for worse,
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.880]   in sickness and in health,
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.460]   till death do us part.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.720]   That vow isn't just a tradition,
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.040]   it is a commitment with your significant other
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.280]   before God and family and friends.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.720]   And unless you explicitly declare,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.960]   hey, just to be clear,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.680]   there's some caveats to my vows.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.040]   No, whatever you commit to doing,
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.220]   God will hold you to that.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.300]   So don't operate with these underlying asterisks
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.880]   where it's like in sickness and in health,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.080]   till death do us part,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.760]   asterisk, as long as I'm still happy.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.920]   Yeah, I promise to love you,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.800]   asterisk, footnote,
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   as long as I still feel like you're meeting my needs.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.920]   As long as I'm still attracted to you,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.480]   as long as this thing works
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.840]   and it's not too difficult
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.800]   and we don't have what many call
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.500]   irreconcilable differences.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.480]   Love has no caveats.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.660]   See, love isn't something that you fall in and out of.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.160]   It's a choice.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.520]   Often it's a feeling, but often it's a choice.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.600]   And when you stand on that altar and you say,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.680]   I promise to love you till death do us part,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.840]   you know what you're really saying?
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.940]   You're saying, you know what?
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.640]   I don't need to know everything
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.960]   that's gonna happen between now and death.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.840]   I don't need to know about all the ups and all the downs.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.420]   I am committed to loving you.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.760]   I will choose you.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.880]   Till death.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   Just a few more.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.340]   Conflict doesn't change commitment.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.600]   You will fight.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.960]   If you don't fight,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.280]   you probably need to go to marriage counseling
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.200]   'cause you're just not saying what you're thinking.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.400]   Conflict isn't a bad thing.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.720]   It can be a godly thing.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.280]   Conflict can actually point to the love of Jesus Christ
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.840]   because Jesus has reconciled us to God.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.580]   And so he's glorified when we reconcile with each other.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.720]   But when you conflict with one another,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.400]   divorce is not an option.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.560]   And so Catherine and I know it doesn't matter
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.240]   how bad this fight is.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:34.380]   In the end, it is worth it because we're stuck together.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.480]   We are stuck together.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.800]   And as Ben Rector says,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.680]   "Forever is a long time to be sad."
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.360]   So we might as well fight for it.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.080]   Next, being faithful is better than being famous.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.560]   Being faithful is better than being famous.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.760]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.340]   Some of you guys have this instinctive drive to achieve,
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.860]   and that's an awesome thing.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.600]   That's a God-given thing.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   But it can become, instead of godly, it just becomes God.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.560]   And some of you guys are chasing something.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.060]   You've turned it into your God success,
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.140]   a bottom line on a bank account.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.200]   You don't know me and I don't know you,
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.280]   but I just want to lovingly say,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.980]   we wear busyness and workaholism around
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.080]   like a badge of honor.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.240]   There is nothing impressive about working 80 hours a week.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.120]   There's nothing impressive about that.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.960]   And I promise you,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.520]   there will be nothing impressive to your spouse
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.240]   about you working 80 hours a week.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.120]   You want to know why?
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.080]   Because your spouse will never see you.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.840]   There is nothing noble about that.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.680]   So drive, succeed, achieve.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.200]   But you know what?
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.140]   Be faithful.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.960]   If it comes down to a job
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.840]   that will make your life extremely unhealthy,
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.100]   but everyone will know who you are at work
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.160]   and everyone at work will respect you
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.920]   versus being faithful to your wife,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   faithful to your husband, loving your kids, choose that.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.240]   'Cause you're not going to get to heaven
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.720]   and God's like, oh man, well done,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.000]   good and faithful workaholic.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.400]   Oh man, well done, good and faithful,
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.080]   100 hour a week girl.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.400]   Now what does he celebrate?
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.960]   Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.080]   Last thing and I've gone long, sorry about that.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:46.280]   Today is the best day to passionately follow Jesus.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:53.080]   Whatever day you find yourself waking up on today
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.840]   is the best day to follow Jesus.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.280]   That's it, best thing you can do for your marriage
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.080]   is walk faithfully with your God.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.360]   And let me just close by saying this.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.980]   You know what, some of you guys are like,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.240]   you know what, this is great.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.520]   Thanks for talking about marriage,
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.700]   but what if I never get married?
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.360]   Like you just said, that marriage exists
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.560]   to put the glory of God, the beauty of God on display.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.920]   What if I never get married?
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.720]   What if I'm never able to truly fulfill the purpose
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.040]   for which I've been created,
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.680]   which is to truly put the beauty of Jesus on display?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.920]   Well, here's what you need to understand.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.820]   Genesis 2:24 says that a man will leave his father
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.560]   and his mother and be joined to his wife
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.080]   and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.760]   Well, Jesus Christ left his father in heaven
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.820]   and came to earth and he did work on a cross, why?
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.400]   So that he could become one with us,
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.600]   his bride.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.960]   That's what we're called.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.680]   We are called the bride of Christ.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.640]   The point of this is ultimately not about marriage.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.540]   Marriage is an ultimate, knowing Jesus is truly ultimate
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:08.120]   because it's when you are known by Jesus Christ,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.580]   when you are his bride, you have everything you need
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.240]   for life and godliness.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.320]   And your life becomes a beautiful display
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   of Jesus's love to you and the rest of the world.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.400]   I wanna save your marriage before it begins.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.140]   So many people's dreams and reality
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.100]   go in two totally different directions.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.460]   Where it starts is with Jesus Christ.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.800]   Do you know him?
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.160]   If you do, walk faithfully with him.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.840]   If you don't, the invitation tonight is to come
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.120]   and be his bride.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   Let's pray together.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:13.480]   Lord Jesus, I thank you for who you are.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.080]   I thank you for how you've loved us.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.160]   I thank you that you left heaven and you came to earth
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.760]   so that we could be joined to you,
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.400]   that we could become one with you,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.600]   that we could experience intimacy with you, Lord God.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:35.880]   I pray, God, that you do a good work in our hearts tonight.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.960]   God, I pray for my friends in this room.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.220]   For those who long to get married one day,
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:47.320]   I pray that there would be many marriages,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.360]   future marriages represented in this room
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.560]   that would put your beauty on display to this world.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.520]   I pray that many in this world would come to know you
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.960]   through the love that is seen in the marriages
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.160]   represented in this world.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.220]   And in this room, may our marriages,
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.600]   may our stories point to a greater story
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.940]   that you, Jesus, left heaven and came to earth.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.300]   You lived the life that we couldn't.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.500]   You died the death that we deserve to die.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.340]   You rose from the dead.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.660]   You conquered sin and death
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.400]   so that we could become one with you.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.960]   We need you, God.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.300]   We trust you.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.700]   We love you.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.820]   Would you do a work in our lives and our hearts tonight?
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.780]   In Jesus' name, amen.
