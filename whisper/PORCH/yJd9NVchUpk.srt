1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,240
 - You have seven unheard messages.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,920
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,960
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,440
 - Hey, yo, Danny!

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
 Where are you at, bro?

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,920
 I'll see you soon, all right?

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,040
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,400
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,320
 on my heart for a reason, so please call me back.

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,680
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,000
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,480
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,920
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,680
 - No, I'm sure this is the right number,

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,600
 but last night was a mistake.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,520
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,720
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,520
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,840
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,300
 and we need to talk.

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,480
 (phone ringing)

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
 - All right, Porsche, how we doing tonight?

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
 You doing okay?

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
 It's great to see you.

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,560
 Welcome back.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,040
 If it's a return trip to you here,

28
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
 we're so grateful that you would be in the room.

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,200
 If this is your very first time at the Porsche,

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,160
 we're so glad that you are in the room.

31
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,640
 This summer has been wild.

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,120
 It's gotten rowdy in this room at times,

33
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,280
 and we're grateful that you would turn up

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,420
 and be a part of it.

35
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,840
 God's not just doing something awesome here.

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
 He's doing something great all over the place.

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,680
 He is moving in cities just like ours all across the nation.

38
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,120
 Particularly, we want to shout out

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,360
 some of our Porsche Live locations.

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,080
 Porsche Live, Greater Lafayette, Fresno, and Scottsdale.

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,960
 Hey, before we jump in, I do want to ask,

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,200
 if you haven't noticed, it's pretty packed in here.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,700
 We've got people that are still trying to find seats

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,860
 outside in the town center and in our overflow.

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,360
 And so if you could, if there are seats available to you,

46
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,640
 left or right, would you move into those seats?

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,120
 Could we all squeeze in a little bit,

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,180
 get cozy with the people to your left and to your right?

49
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,520
 Maybe you'll meet someone this evening, maybe you won't.

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,240
 I'm not sure, but this could be a good opportunity

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,480
 to see if it's possible and make some room

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
 for some of our friends.

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,360
 That's awesome, thank you so much.

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,120
 Well, hey, tonight we are continuing the conversation

55
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,040
 that we started last week in answering the question,

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,840
 is dating supposed to be this hard?

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
 It's a question that many of you are confronted with.

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,640
 And so we wanted to step right into it

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,520
 and answer it with what God has to say.

60
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,880
 To set up the idea, I remember asking myself that question

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,960
 when I first had my initial interaction with love,

62
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
 I was but 12 years old.

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,620
 And at that time I asked out a girl

64
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,400
 for the very first time in my young life.

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,800
 You see, the annual homecoming football game was coming up

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,880
 and everybody was taking a date.

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,900
 And so not wanting to be left out

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,560
 or look different than everybody else,

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,200
 I had my eye on my grade school crush

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
 and I knew this was the perfect moment for me to ask her

71
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
 if she wanted to go with me.

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,840
 And so not having been in this position before,

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
 I asked some of my buddies,

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
 hey, you guys have done it, like help me out.

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
 And so gleaning all the 12 year old wisdom I could get,

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,960
 what I learned in that moment is they would stand

77
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,800
 across the hall in the middle of passing period,

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,160
 they would signal to me whenever she came out of her class.

79
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,760
 And then all I had to do was walk up and just simply say,

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,880
 hey, do you wanna go to homecoming with me?

81
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,120
 And so we assumed our positions.

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
 The bell rang, people exit their classes,

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
 they begin going to their next place.

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
 And right at the time they give me the signal, go for it,

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,320
 man, and I like move from where I am.

86
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,080
 And I turned the corner to coincidentally bump into her

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360
 and we make contact.

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
 And I look at her and I say,

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 hey, do you wanna go to the homecoming football game with me?

90
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,680
 To which she responded, I'm sorry, who are you?

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,640
 (congregation laughing)

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,840
 Again, I was but just a youth,

93
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,640
 but I remember even thinking at that time,

94
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,240
 this is so much harder than I thought.

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,560
 Like no one had told me how to approach a girl

96
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,640
 or how to keep the stakes low

97
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
 or how to not come on too strong

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
 or how to express my feelings.

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,440
 And in the same way, so many of us have been unlearned

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,520
 in the language and lessons of love

101
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,840
 because no one's ever told us.

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,320
 The way that we've learned instead is by trial and error.

103
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,280
 Amen, anybody?

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,720
 Trial and error, after error and after error

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,400
 and after error and after error.

106
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
 You see, you have found yourself

107
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,600
 kind of risking the rejection

108
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,320
 of whether or not they'll leave you on read or not.

109
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,040
 You've seen within yourself this awkward burden

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
 of having to go into another first date

111
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,080
 and potentially bear the consequence

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,760
 of another uncomfortable conversation.

113
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,520
 You've had to guess their intent

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
 because though they're flirtatious,

115
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,160
 they've never actually clarified their feelings for you.

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,200
 You don't know if you're best friends

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
 or if you're soon to be lovers.

118
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 You have no idea.

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
 This is the landscape of love that you're a part of.

120
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
 It is confusing.

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
 You see, for so many of us, you've looked at dating

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
 and found it to be less blissful than you hoped

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
 and more painful than you expected.

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,000
 And there's a good reason for that.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,400
 Your generation is facing the most complicated

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,480
 dating dynamic in the history of the world.

127
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
 You're welcome.

128
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,320
 You did not ask for it, but it is the hand you've been dealt.

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 You see, you live amongst a moment

130
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,080
 where you have to learn not just dating etiquette,

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,640
 but online dating etiquette.

132
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,680
 There are shifting gender roles.

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,680
 There's an ever evolving relationship structure at play.

134
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,200
 And then we live in an ever increasing

135
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,220
 individualistic society where people are fine

136
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,760
 if they don't find love.

137
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,360
 You see, according to Dr. Michael Rosenfeld,

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,220
 professor of sociology at Stanford,

139
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,120
 talking about the considerable impact

140
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,600
 our modern dating moment has had in the lives of people,

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,400
 he says, "There are 10 million more single Americans

142
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,040
 "right now than at any other given moment in history."

143
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,080
 10 million.

144
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,600
 And most of them are under the age of 35,

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
 which makes sense when you think about it.

146
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,500
 That might feel shocking, but if you look at the data,

147
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
 it's not surprising because we've seen

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,480
 the average age of first marriage has steadily increased

149
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,940
 over the last several years.

150
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,480
 We know that women are on average marrying at 28,

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,760
 guys are on average marrying at the age of 30,

152
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,920
 but it's not just that people are waiting longer to marry,

153
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,320
 it's also that divorce rates are skyrocketing

154
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,360
 amongst people that are in their 20s and 30s specifically.

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,640
 You see, we're living in a moment

156
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,560
 that the experts are calling a romantic recession,

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
 that love is on the lam,

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
 despite the fact that young people just like yourself

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
 overwhelmingly identify as wanting to be

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,040
 in a committed relationship.

161
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,720
 So many even go into the point of anticipating

162
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
 tying the knot at some point in the future.

163
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
 So how can both of these things be true at the same time?

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,240
 How is it that romance can be on the decline

165
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,400
 and yet everybody wants to find love anyways?

166
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
 I'll tell you how it's possible.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
 We're not very good at dating.

168
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,500
 That's the synopsis.

169
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,880
 That's how we make sense of those two realities.

170
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
 We do not know what we're doing,

171
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,120
 so much so that there is an entire television segment

172
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,480
 committed to this reality.

173
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,440
 Like if you've ever watched "Bachelor in Paradise"

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,040
 or "Love Island" or "Love is Blind,"

175
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,500
 what is the basic premise of those shows?

176
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,120
 The premise is this.

177
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,840
 They get together a group of people

178
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,120
 that deeply want to find love,

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
 but are horrible at finding it.

180
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,480
 You see, you see within those shows,

181
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,120
 a group of people that they're waiting for a hotter option

182
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,080
 to walk down the beach.

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,300
 They're playing a mind game

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,960
 so that way they don't get voted off in some way.

185
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,000
 They're trying to hook up with someone,

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
 yet not learn their last name

187
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,320
 because they don't want to get too committed too soon.

188
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,820
 You see, they have no idea what they're doing.

189
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,120
 And we watch them for it.

190
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
 You're not watching

191
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,160
 because you're anticipating the moment they find love.

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
 You're watching them

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,960
 because you're anticipating the moment they don't.

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 And they spiral into an emotional dumpster fire of disaster.

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
 Like that's what you're waiting for.

196
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 You want the drama.

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,880
 That's why we watch these shows.

198
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,360
 And yet while it's easy for us

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,480
 in the comfort of our seats to point the finger and laugh,

200
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
 look at those people.

201
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,680
 They have no idea what they're doing.

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,640
 The truth of the matter is,

203
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,880
 we don't know what we're doing either.

204
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,020
 This moment is a difficult moment.

205
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,680
 We make dating harder than it has to be.

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,760
 And so here's my hope.

207
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,200
 My hope is to make it easy or easier

208
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,740
 over the course of our evening.

209
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,080
 You see, I want to tell you the do's and the don'ts of dating

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,520
 because when you follow them,

211
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,180
 these principles that God has given us,

212
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,220
 the entire process, it gets so much easier.

213
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,660
 And these principles,

214
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,980
 they're not just some rules for you to know.

215
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,580
 That way you can enter them like a cheat code

216
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,620
 and out pops a spouse at the end of it.

217
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,500
 You see, a lot of dating damage has been done

218
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,380
 in the name of a Christian formula

219
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,280
 where X plus Y equals soulmate.

220
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,500
 That's not my hope.

221
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,980
 I'm not trying to give you a scientific method.

222
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,460
 Dating is not science.

223
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,780
 Dating is art.

224
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,560
 Yes, there are colors you must use,

225
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,320
 but you must also learn from the master artist himself.

226
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,740
 You must listen to God

227
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,700
 for he has built these principles

228
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,940
 to point to a greater picture,

229
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,340
 a picture of the love that he has for his people.

230
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
 And so without further ado,

231
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,860
 we're going to get into these principles.

232
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,660
 Last week, we went through four of them.

233
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,380
 I do not have time to unpack those four.

234
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
 If you're interested, they're on the screen behind me.

235
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,480
 You can also go and watch the message

236
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,500
 or listen to the audio,

237
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,620
 but I just want to dive straight into the fifth principle

238
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,680
 that you need if you want to make your dating easier.

239
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,220
 So here it is, the fifth principle that you need.

240
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,800
 Don't be isolated.

241
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
 Do be inclusive.

242
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,040
 Don't be isolated, but be inclusive.

243
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,260
 You see, dating is not a static state of commitment.

244
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,060
 It is a dynamic process of assessment,

245
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,920
 but too often we perform that assessment all by ourself.

246
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,060
 So last year, I bought a 1991 Ford F-150,

247
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,700
 which is a dream to me,

248
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,580
 but the reality is I didn't know anything

249
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,700
 about 35-year-old vehicles.

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,060
 And so to help me in the purchasing process,

251
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,620
 I made sure to schedule an appointment with a mechanic.

252
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,440
 Like it wasn't enough for me to just walk up,

253
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,420
 pop the hood, and take a look and say,

254
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,460
 "Yeah, this thing looks great."

255
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,540
 No, I knew that I needed professional help.

256
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,700
 And so I took the truck to this mechanic

257
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,980
 and he didn't just pop the hood and look at it

258
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,820
 and say, "Yeah, man, it looks great."

259
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,620
 Instead, he took that truck and he put it on a lift

260
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,060
 and he raised it to the sky

261
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,540
 so that we could walk underneath it

262
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,100
 and we can inspect every square inch of the thing

263
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,020
 because he wanted to help me

264
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,740
 know that it was worthy of purchasing,

265
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,660
 that the value was present.

266
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,940
 You see, I needed someone else's help

267
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,900
 to make a good decision.

268
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,820
 And yet so many of us, we settle in the world of dating

269
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,660
 for making the assessment on our own.

270
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,420
 Well, he passes the eye test for me.

271
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,500
 Have you seen those arms?

272
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
 That looks good.

273
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,500
 You know, like that's often the way that we process

274
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,140
 whether or not we're going to get in a relationship

275
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,380
 with someone or not.

276
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,740
 And yet that's not the Bible's recommendation.

277
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,220
 The Bible says in Proverbs 11, 14,

278
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,380
 "Where there is no guidance, a people falls,

279
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,340
 but in an abundance of counselors, there is safety."

280
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,740
 In Proverbs 15, 22, "Without counsel, plans fail,

281
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,620
 but with many advisors, they succeed."

282
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,620
 You see, isolation makes for poor evaluation.

283
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,820
 Isolation makes for poor evaluation.

284
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,940
 There's a reason we say, "You're lost in your fields."

285
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,700
 What are we communicating when we say that?

286
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,580
 We're saying, "You're crushing so hard

287
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,580
 that you're just seeing what you want to see,

288
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,740
 but your friends will see what you need to see."

289
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,540
 You see, some of you, you're in a relationship

290
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,180
 where your community has raised a red flag

291
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,780
 because, man, he is sketchy.

292
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,180
 Like he never shows up when he says he's going to show up.

293
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,060
 He is never arriving when he says he's going to arrive.

294
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,900
 Or they've looked at you and said,

295
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
 "Man, she's pretty controlling.

296
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
 Like, have you thought about that?

297
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,940
 It seems like she always wants to know where you are

298
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,820
 and what you're doing."

299
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,380
 They have raised red flags.

300
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,980
 And yet too often we look at them and go,

301
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,460
 "But you don't know him or her the way that I do."

302
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,420
 Listen, it is difficult to see red flags

303
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,580
 when you have on rose-colored glasses.

304
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,940
 You need help.

305
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,100
 You need people to speak the truth to you in love.

306
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,300
 In the medieval ages,

307
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,420
 the Anglican church liturgized the phrase,

308
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,580
 "Speak now or forever hold your peace."

309
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,220
 And the reason they did

310
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,060
 is they were trying to provide protection

311
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,900
 from people within their community

312
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,820
 being forcefully coerced into an unwanted marriage.

313
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,140
 It was a method for their community to protect their own.

314
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,220
 And a similar premise must be true in our day.

315
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,740
 You see, the more community you include,

316
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,540
 the more safety you invite.

317
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,100
 The more community you include, the more safety you invite.

318
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,620
 So when Brooke and I, my wife, started dating in college,

319
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,540
 I remember my best friend at the time

320
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,380
 coming to me and saying,

321
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,660
 "Hey man, I'd love to tag along."

322
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,500
 On a date?

323
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,340
 Yes, on a date.

324
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,260
 As a third wheel?

325
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,620
 Sure, as a third wheel.

326
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,260
 Why did he wanna go on a date with us?

327
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,540
 Not because he wanted to see Frozen.

328
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,700
 He came on that date with us

329
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,980
 because he wanted to get to know Brooke.

330
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,340
 He wanted to see the two of us interact.

331
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,700
 He wanted to know, man, is it easy for y'all

332
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,740
 when you're together?

333
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
 Does she fit the form of the kind of godly woman

334
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,860
 that you've told me you want?

335
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,820
 Is there strife, conflict early in your relationship?

336
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,420
 Do y'all move through things pretty naturally?

337
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,340
 He wanted to evaluate her for my benefit.

338
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,300
 And it's a testament to my bride.

339
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,140
 She was delighted to have him come.

340
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,060
 She was so eager to meet somebody from my world,

341
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,180
 see someone that had a massive voice

342
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,420
 and influence in my life.

343
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,700
 She wanted to become familiar with the people

344
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,500
 that I was a part of.

345
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,780
 You see, when Brooke and I were dating,

346
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,540
 we wanted godly people to watch us

347
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,340
 and help us because we needed to be watched

348
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,500
 and we needed to be helped.

349
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,980
 We dated not just in the context of community,

350
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,700
 but inclusive of our community.

351
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,060
 It wasn't just that we were content having people around.

352
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,900
 No, we wanted people to be involved.

353
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,620
 There's a major difference in those things.

354
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
 You see, if you're in a relationship with someone

355
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,940
 that's trying to isolate you from your friends

356
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,460
 or your family, or they get annoyed

357
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,900
 whenever you spend time with your community,

358
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,260
 or they always wanna do things with you in private,

359
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,180
 they're diametrically opposed to ever going out in public,

360
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,260
 then you need to get away from that person.

361
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,020
 God saved us into community.

362
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,860
 His people see the value of it.

363
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,140
 And we do not try to isolate ourselves away

364
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,700
 from that which God has saved us into.

365
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,780
 You need this.

366
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,020
 You need a community.

367
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,380
 And not just a community that consists of good friends.

368
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,940
 Hear me, you need a community that consists of godly guides.

369
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,500
 What's the difference in those two things?

370
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,980
 Friends make for good company,

371
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,660
 but guides give good direction.

372
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,020
 You need people in your life

373
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,340
 that will not simply tell you what you wanna hear,

374
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,980
 but will tell you what you need to hear.

375
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,580
 You need people that are really two things,

376
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,100
 people that are wise and loving,

377
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,540
 like they're wise enough to know what you need

378
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,140
 and they are loving enough to tell you what you need.

379
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,340
 I'm a firm believer in this.

380
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,460
 I'll step away from the book.

381
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,020
 This is just my personal recommendation.

382
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,660
 I think that you should imbue people within your community

383
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,300
 that are identified as wise and loving

384
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,540
 with not only a voice in your relationship,

385
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,420
 but a vote in your relationship.

386
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,220
 So if they look at you and the majority of them say,

387
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,820
 "This thing looks toxic," then you end it.

388
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,300
 If the majority of them say,

389
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,660
 "Man, we think you should go out with this person,"

390
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,380
 then you should go on at least one date with that person.

391
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
 Why?

392
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,340
 Because these are people that they are wise in God's word,

393
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,460
 they love your heart,

394
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,840
 and you can trust them with your relationship.

395
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,740
 The second thing that you need in godly guides

396
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,740
 is you need people that have walked with God longer than you.

397
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,900
 There's a saying,

398
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,180
 "The best teacher isn't personal experience,

399
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,060
 "it's someone else's."

400
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,140
 And I agree with that.

401
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,860
 I think that saying is spot on.

402
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,980
 And the apostle Paul says he agrees as well.

403
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,340
 In Titus 2, he gives specific instruction

404
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,940
 to older men and women

405
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,380
 about investing in the lives of younger men and women.

406
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,780
 But Kylan, I don't know any older men.

407
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,400
 Then find some.

408
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,380
 They're not hard to point out.

409
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,820
 They're pretty obvious by way of their appearance.

410
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,820
 It's not difficult to see people that are older than you.

411
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,100
 I remember when I was in college,

412
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,260
 I wanted, I was absent anybody in my life

413
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,780
 that was older and wiser than myself.

414
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,300
 Everyone was my age.

415
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,420
 It was the blind leading the blind.

416
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,540
 So I wanted someone to speak into my world.

417
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,660
 And so what I did is I remember going to church

418
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,600
 and seeing a guy who I did not know personally,

419
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,620
 but he had an amazing reputation.

420
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,800
 And I admired him from afar.

421
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,140
 I admired the way he loved his wife

422
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,500
 and he treated his kids and he served in his church

423
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,300
 and he somehow all at the same time led within his company.

424
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,020
 This was the kind of guy that I wanted to learn from.

425
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,860
 And so I went up to him and you know what I said?

426
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,260
 I admire you for these following reasons.

427
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,020
 Can I take you to lunch and ask you some questions?

428
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,060
 He said, yes.

429
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,900
 Why?

430
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,020
 Because godly guides are looking for people

431
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,440
 to give guidance to.

432
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,540
 So this is not hard.

433
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,040
 If you wanna know what to do,

434
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,140
 ask humbly, buy them lunch,

435
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,820
 prep questions, listen more than you speak

436
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,060
 and then thank them for their time.

437
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,380
 Don't walk in and load them down with,

438
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,860
 hey, will you be my mentor?

439
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,340
 I don't recommend you do that in a dating relationship.

440
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,860
 Will you be my wife?

441
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,280
 That's not gonna go well either.

442
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,140
 It's synonymous in terms of its intensity.

443
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,100
 Don't do that.

444
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,180
 Walk up and say, hey, I would love to get time with you.

445
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,100
 Would you be open for that?

446
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,260
 Here's the following reasons.

447
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,220
 I'll buy lunch, I'll prep questions.

448
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,300
 I will make sure to listen and take notes

449
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,900
 and then I will be so grateful for the hour you carve.

450
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,460
 That's what you have to do.

451
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,060
 Dating is hard when you do it alone,

452
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,860
 but you're not meant to.

453
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
 That's not God's design.

454
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,560
 And the beauty of it is that community actually teaches us

455
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,980
 how we're supposed to treat our partner,

456
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,080
 which brings us to our sixth principle.

457
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,420
 Don't be critical.

458
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,980
 Do be kind.

459
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,180
 Don't be critical, but be kind.

460
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,220
 Proverbs 19, 22a, ladies, this is what you want.

461
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,220
 What is desirable in a man is his kindness, his kindness,

462
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,340
 which feels obvious.

463
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,940
 Yes, yes, I know, Kylan,

464
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,420
 I'm supposed to like the nice guys.

465
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,740
 I need to give them a shot.

466
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,500
 This is so much bigger than that.

467
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,940
 I'm not just trying to tell you to find a Hallmark hubby

468
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,180
 that you can take home for the holidays

469
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
 and make your parents happy.

470
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,220
 That's not what this is about

471
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,900
 because that's not what the Bible's communicating.

472
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,020
 The Bible is teaching something so much more serious

473
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
 in this moment.

474
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,780
 You see, in the New Testament,

475
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,820
 the authors of every New Testament letter,

476
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,900
 they combine to pull together 50 plus one another statements

477
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,000
 and those statements tell us

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,700
 how we're meant to treat one another.

479
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,420
 Why are there 50 plus?

480
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,280
 Because it's not so obvious how we should treat one another.

481
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,300
 We're not very good at it.

482
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,280
 And so what we see is they unpack 50 plus

483
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,120
 one another statements.

484
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,080
 And while we don't have time to walk through all 50 plus,

485
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,900
 what we can do is we can break them down

486
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,220
 into the buckets they belong

487
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,740
 because those 50 plus statements

488
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,860
 belong in four different categories.

489
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,500
 So that way you understand what kindness looks like

490
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,900
 as it's expressed in your dating relationship.

491
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,380
 The first thing is that kindness is peaceable.

492
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,420
 Kindness is peaceable.

493
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,260
 You see, more than one third of the one another statements

494
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,780
 are about pursuing peace and maintaining unity.

495
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,060
 Second Corinthians 13 11 by the apostle Paul says,

496
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,560
 "Finally, brothers, rejoice, aim for restoration,

497
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,860
 comfort one another, agree with one another,

498
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,040
 live in peace and the God of love and peace

499
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
 will be with you."

500
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,980
 Ephesians 4 1 and 3 says,

501
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,480
 "I, therefore a prisoner for the Lord,

502
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,800
 urge you walk in a manner worthy of the calling

503
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,260
 to which you've been called."

504
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,140
 How do I do that?

505
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,360
 "With all humility and gentleness,

506
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,820
 with patience, bearing with one another in love,

507
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,800
 eager to maintain the unity of the spirit

508
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,500
 in the bond of peace."

509
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,700
 What are these passages saying?

510
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,280
 You are going to face conflict in life

511
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,800
 and you're gonna face conflict in dating.

512
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,880
 It's coming for you.

513
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,520
 When you are in close emotional proximity to another person,

514
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,280
 they are gonna say something that gets on your nerves.

515
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,160
 They're gonna do something

516
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,000
 that you can't even begin to explain.

517
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,420
 They're going to forget something that drives you nuts.

518
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,140
 And then how they respond whenever that conflict comes,

519
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,400
 it tells you a lot about their character,

520
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,500
 which is what you're trying to figure out.

521
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,460
 Guys, women are sophisticated by design and you are not.

522
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,240
 And so you're going to mess up

523
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
 and you're not even going to understand why.

524
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,840
 You're not even gonna know what you did.

525
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,520
 And yet in that moment,

526
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
 the right response is not to get defensive,

527
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,440
 but I didn't mean to hurt her feelings,

528
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,480
 but you did hurt her feelings.

529
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,880
 And so you need to understand what did I do

530
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,280
 that resulted in your feelings being hurt?

531
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,080
 Because I don't want that to happen anymore.

532
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,280
 And so here's what you do.

533
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,760
 She's gonna use her words

534
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,200
 and you're gonna use your ears

535
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
 and you're gonna listen closely

536
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
 and then you're gonna own as much of it as you can.

537
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,760
 I tell couples whenever I perform their wedding ceremonies,

538
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,360
 "Hey, marriage is not 50/50, it is 100/100.

539
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,840
 I am not approaching you today saying,

540
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,200
 I'm gonna give you my half so long as you give me yours.

541
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,760
 No, I'm 7'4" and I'm giving you the whole 100.

542
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
 I'm giving you everything I have.

543
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,320
 Everything I offer you today

544
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,760
 is not conditioned upon what you do at all."

545
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,240
 Men, that's how you approach your woman in conflict.

546
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,160
 Ladies, they don't know what you're thinking.

547
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,280
 So when you think, "He would if he wanted,"

548
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,660
 he doesn't even know what you might possibly want of him.

549
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,980
 (congregation laughing)

550
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,820
 And so what you must do is you must seek to understand.

551
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,960
 You must use small words.

552
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,980
 And then you need to be committed to re-explaining yourself

553
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,120
 'cause he's going to need you to do it.

554
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,620
 (congregation laughing)

555
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,340
 Hear me, if you have the right man,

556
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,680
 he is not just willing to improve, he's wanting to improve.

557
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,940
 That's the right man, he wants to.

558
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,260
 And so when you come to him and if you have some beef,

559
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,300
 some issue with what he's done, don't accuse his character.

560
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,660
 Well, you just never care about me.

561
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,820
 Oh my, you're just not full of grace.

562
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,420
 I'm always seeking peace with you,

563
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,620
 but you're never seeking peace with me.

564
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,460
 Don't do that.

565
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,260
 Don't make an accusation against his character.

566
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,980
 Make an observation about his behavior.

567
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,100
 What did he do that made you feel this way?

568
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
 Because he can address that, he can fix his behavior.

569
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,360
 Don't write him off before you even give him the chance.

570
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,580
 If you want to be with someone that is peaceable,

571
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,700
 then you're looking for someone that is humble enough

572
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,140
 to admit they're wrong.

573
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,100
 And catch me, they're humble enough to admit they're wrong,

574
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,520
 not because they love you, but because they love Jesus

575
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,660
 and they don't want to grieve his heart.

576
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,980
 That's what you want.

577
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
 That's what someone who's peaceable looks like.

578
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,820
 The second category for kindness is kindness is considerate.

579
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,660
 It's considerate.

580
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,140
 This makes up another third of the one another statements

581
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,020
 that we get in the New Testament.

582
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,500
 John 13, 34 says, "A new commandment I give to you

583
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,340
 that you love one another, just as I've loved you,

584
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,900
 so also are you to love one another."

585
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,940
 First Peter 4, 8, "Above all,

586
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,940
 keep loving one another earnestly,

587
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,860
 since love covers a multitude of sins."

588
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,140
 That's the kind of person you want to date.

589
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,340
 You want to date someone that is considerate

590
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,780
 of what it looks like to love you,

591
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,220
 which absolutely rails against the standards of today.

592
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,020
 We live in a moment right now

593
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,620
 where people want to keep their options open,

594
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,580
 where they'll string each other along,

595
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,540
 where they're adopting open forms of relationship

596
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,020
 because then they are not having

597
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,940
 to make any kind of commitment.

598
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,500
 We live in a commitment-averse culture.

599
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,020
 And yet what we hear from this

600
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,060
 is that is not considered of someone else,

601
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,100
 it is considered of themself.

602
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,980
 You don't want to be with someone like that.

603
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,080
 You don't want someone that considers themself.

604
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 You want someone that is carefully considering you instead.

605
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,300
 This may sound really silly.

606
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,860
 When Brooke and I first started dating,

607
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,900
 I made a commitment that I was not going to like

608
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,500
 another girl's photo on Instagram the entire time,

609
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,900
 which feels crazy.

610
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,820
 You're like, "Did she put you up to that?"

611
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,140
 No, I chose to do that.

612
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,960
 Why?

613
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,900
 Because I didn't want to run the risk

614
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,300
 of her seeing my name like in some other girl's picture.

615
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,140
 That's dumb.

616
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,100
 That's not worth it.

617
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,980
 Even if we're friends,

618
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,340
 and there's a totally plausible reason for why I would do it,

619
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,220
 I'm not willing to risk my relationship with her.

620
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,500
 I want to make sure everything I do

621
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,060
 is in consideration of her.

622
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,340
 I wanted to prove you don't need to worry about me,

623
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,300
 where my eyes are going, who it is I'm liking,

624
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,700
 who I might be texting on the side.

625
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,900
 You never have to worry about me

626
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,460
 'cause I'm considerate of you.

627
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,860
 If your boyfriend or girlfriend,

628
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,060
 if they start acting all weird

629
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,380
 when you grab their phone from them,

630
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,260
 or if they can't seem to commit to your plans

631
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,700
 for the weekend because you're with your family

632
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,180
 and they don't really love being around them,

633
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
 or if they're vague about what their weekend events

634
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,940
 look like with the boys or the girls,

635
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,340
 then that's a cause for concern.

636
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,180
 That's not a sign of consideration.

637
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,620
 You see, we're looking for someone who looks like Christ.

638
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,740
 What does Christ look like?

639
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,740
 He was considerate of you at great cost to himself,

640
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,540
 even to the point of death on the cross.

641
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,180
 Third category, we gotta go.

642
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,320
 Kindness is encouraging.

643
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,160
 It's encouraging.

644
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,980
 This comprises about 18 to 20% of the statements.

645
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,740
 Hebrews 10, 24, 25 says, "And let us consider,"

646
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
 there's that word,

647
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,300
 "how to stir one another up to love and good works,

648
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,660
 not neglecting to meet together,

649
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,820
 as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another,

650
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,280
 and all the more as you see the day drawing near."

651
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,120
 You see, to encourage literally means

652
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,780
 to put courage into another person.

653
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,140
 You don't want a relationship that tears you down.

654
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,820
 You want a relationship that builds you up.

655
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,340
 And that sounds really nice.

656
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,740
 And yet, listen to me,

657
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,080
 if he is questioning something about you

658
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,860
 that is outside the realm of your power to control,

659
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,100
 he's not building you up, he's tearing you down.

660
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,460
 So if he gets onto you about your physical appearance,

661
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,660
 or he's talking bad about your personality,

662
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,180
 or whatever it may be,

663
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,020
 that's not someone that's wanting to encourage you.

664
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,180
 That's someone that's wanting to invalidate you.

665
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,580
 If she is constantly comparing you

666
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,380
 to all of her boyfriends, all of her girlfriends,

667
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,820
 boyfriends, then that's not someone

668
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,020
 you wanna be compared to.

669
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,140
 You don't necessarily want to link up

670
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,360
 with someone that makes a big deal

671
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,100
 out of a really small deal.

672
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,100
 If you're perpetually in trouble over senseless things,

673
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,840
 then you should be concerned.

674
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,740
 You want someone that is encouraging.

675
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,480
 Proverbs 21, nine says,

676
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,760
 "It is better to live in a corner of the housetop

677
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
 than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife."

678
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,880
 AKA, if you're around a nagging Nancy,

679
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,380
 it's like being waterboarded.

680
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,280
 You don't want that.

681
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,920
 Your relationship should be marked by encouragement.

682
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,760
 It should put courage into you.

683
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,540
 Courage into you to not just be a good boyfriend

684
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,280
 or girlfriend, but courage into you to be

685
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,780
 all that God has made you to be.

686
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,980
 To live into the body, live into the personality,

687
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,640
 live into the design that he has perfectly imbued you with.

688
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,760
 That's what he wants.

689
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,640
 And then the fourth category is kindness is humble.

690
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,140
 That's like the last 15% or so.

691
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,660
 Galatians 5, 13 says,

692
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,240
 "For you were called to freedom, brothers.

693
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,220
 Only don't use your freedom as an opportunity

694
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,220
 for the flesh, but through love, serve one another."

695
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,940
 Philippians 2, three through four says,

696
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,540
 "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,

697
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,420
 but in humility count others more significant than yourself.

698
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,340
 Let each of you look not only to his own interests,

699
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,340
 but also to the interests of others."

700
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,560
 See, put simply, your relationship should be marked

701
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,840
 by humility.

702
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,600
 But where do I find that kind of person, Kylan?

703
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,840
 Like how do I know if they're actually humble

704
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,400
 or if they're just making a really good first impression?

705
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,640
 That's a great question to ask

706
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 because they should be putting their best foot forward.

707
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
 Do you wanna know where you can look

708
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,680
 for a genuinely humble person?

709
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,000
 You look for them where they're not solely humble for you.

710
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,120
 They are humble without you.

711
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,800
 You look for them in places where they serve.

712
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,160
 That's why I tell people, it's not the reason you should,

713
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,560
 but if you begin to serve,

714
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,640
 that's a good place to look for her or him.

715
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
 I remember when I worked in college ministry,

716
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
 we had team leaders,

717
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,260
 the very best of the volunteers that we had

718
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,360
 that always seemed to crush on one another,

719
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
 even though they weren't supposed to.

720
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,840
 And the reason why they would crush on one another

721
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,400
 is because they looked at each other

722
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,680
 and they saw you are giving so much of yourself

723
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,960
 for the benefit of other people, and that is attractive.

724
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,980
 I remember when Brooke and I first met,

725
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,520
 this is what she was doing

726
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,260
 amongst a group of people in our business organization.

727
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,380
 She was playing volleyball.

728
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,480
 We were all playing volleyball

729
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,640
 and she was showing up to play 'cause she's competitive,

730
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,480
 but she was also showing up because she's kind.

731
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
 And she wanted to get to know people.

732
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,400
 She wanted to ask them their stories.

733
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,800
 She wanted to make a personal investment.

734
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,440
 She didn't want or she didn't need anything from them,

735
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,840
 validation, approval, but she wanted everything for them.

736
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,320
 She wanted them to know Jesus.

737
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
 And I sat there and I watched that,

738
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,400
 and that was so attractive.

739
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,640
 It was driving me crazy, girl.

740
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
 I need to spend time with you.

741
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,800
 Like that was the reaction

742
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,920
 as I saw her being humble to other people.

743
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,540
 You see, listen, humility is hot.

744
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,900
 It is, it looks good on people.

745
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,180
 And so you should think about looking for it

746
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,980
 in him or her yourself.

747
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,820
 You want someone humble.

748
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,420
 You want someone, catch me,

749
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,100
 that observably lives for the benefit of other people

750
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,740
 because Christ observably died for the benefit of you.

751
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,540
 That's what you want.

752
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,180
 That's what true humility looks like.

753
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,640
 I will give of myself for the benefit of another,

754
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,560
 which brings us to our seventh principle.

755
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,840
 Don't be naive.

756
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,820
 Do be vigilant.

757
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,960
 You be vigilant.

758
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,640
 We're gonna give an entire talk

759
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,160
 committed to this specific topic,

760
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,760
 what sex looks like in the lives of young adults.

761
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,640
 And so I'm gonna resist the temptation

762
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
 to share more right now than I should,

763
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,180
 but we do need to answer the question as we consider,

764
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,680
 I mean, what does it look like for us

765
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,520
 to navigate dating in an easier way?

766
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
 We have to evaluate what does it look like

767
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,740
 for purity to be in play?

768
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,520
 The Bible has a lot to say about this.

769
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,560
 Just a couple of verses.

770
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,240
 Proverbs 6.32, he who commits adultery lacks sense.

771
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,620
 He who does it destroys himself.

772
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,900
 First Corinthians 6.18 says, flee from sexual immorality.

773
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,500
 Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,

774
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,860
 but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.

775
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,180
 You see, sexual compromise outside of God's design

776
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,180
 is dangerous, and that's because sex is so powerful.

777
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,180
 You see, when you have sex with another person,

778
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,980
 your brain releases dopamine,

779
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,740
 which activates the reward system of your brain,

780
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,860
 and it also releases oxytocin,

781
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,060
 which is the love hormone, as people know it for,

782
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,020
 which is especially powerful when it comes to mate bonding.

783
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,500
 What happens when you have sex with another person

784
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,100
 is you are growing attached to them,

785
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,620
 not just in a casual way, in a chemical way.

786
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,260
 And as you do it in greater and greater degrees

787
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,020
 of frequency, that attachment becomes addiction.

788
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,080
 What a beautiful gift from God

789
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,540
 when within the confines of his design,

790
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,560
 a loving marriage between two people

791
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,500
 where there is total safety,

792
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,260
 that that bond will never be broken,

793
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,300
 and so we can pour gas on the fire.

794
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,280
 But when we take it outside of its intended place,

795
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,480
 it can become disastrous.

796
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,460
 Because when you break up with someone,

797
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,100
 you not only lose your partner,

798
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,480
 you lose a part of yourself.

799
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,180
 Sex is so powerful.

800
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,460
 It is so good.

801
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,420
 Like, it's something worth waiting for.

802
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,100
 It's something worth valuing,

803
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,020
 in the same way that Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders

804
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,060
 had to resist every other temptation and jewel

805
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,420
 and have only eyes for the lamp.

806
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,120
 So you are meant to move through your relationship

807
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,880
 with eyes for that which is most prized of all, purity.

808
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,900
 I know that sounds so Christian-y,

809
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,300
 and yet it's so good.

810
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,100
 God is trying to save you from something

811
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,100
 that can irreparably hurt you in the wrong context.

812
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,800
 And so we must agree with what Paul says

813
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,020
 in the Book of Romans.

814
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,060
 We should not make provision for the flesh

815
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,540
 to gratify its desires,

816
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,100
 meaning we don't invite unnecessary temptation

817
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,940
 into our life.

818
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,100
 Like, you don't go into her room.

819
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,500
 You don't stay at his apartment.

820
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,660
 You definitely don't turn the lights down low,

821
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,140
 wait past 11 p.m. 'cause nothing good happens then.

822
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,020
 Don't you dare turn on the R&B,

823
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,220
 because you know those things are gonna put you

824
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,060
 in a position where you're ultimately tempted

825
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,940
 beyond your capacity.

826
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,480
 You set your boundaries early.

827
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,660
 You honor them always.

828
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,660
 And you frequently revisit them.

829
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,340
 I think I've said this before,

830
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,340
 possibly in an equipping night,

831
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,520
 but I will charge my son with this.

832
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:55,020
 Nothing below the chin, nothing horizontal,

833
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,580
 nothing in the dark,

834
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,460
 and nothing lasts longer than five seconds.

835
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,500
 You obey these rules from me, my son,

836
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,140
 and you will be safe.

837
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,780
 Those are good boundaries if you're looking for some.

838
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,380
 Proverbs 25, 28 says, "A man without self-control

839
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,980
 "is like a city broken into and left without walls."

840
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,720
 Would you move into a city that's been pillaged

841
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,580
 of all its resources, plundered and left in ruin?

842
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,100
 Would you do that?

843
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
 Then why are you moving in with somebody,

844
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,900
 some guy, some girl, that does not have self-control either?

845
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,140
 Like, if your boyfriend is convinced you

846
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,060
 that he just needs a sexual outlet,

847
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,700
 what you need to be convinced of is he needs self-control.

848
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,820
 Like, if he's pushing you to send him nudes,

849
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,940
 if he's constantly pushing the boundaries

850
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,660
 of the parameters that y'all have concocted together,

851
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,180
 if he's constantly guilting you

852
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,700
 because you just won't help him,

853
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,060
 then listen, you're not the one who needs help.

854
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,880
 He is the one that needs help.

855
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,880
 Jesus was single and sinless his entire life.

856
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,060
 And so if Jesus can do that for 33 years of his life,

857
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,340
 your man can do that

858
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
 until he either chooses to propose to you

859
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,780
 or he chooses to move on.

860
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,380
 And if he doesn't do either of those,

861
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,420
 then you need to probably move on.

862
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:21,340
 You want a man that's not mastered by his flesh.

863
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,460
 You want a man that has mastered his flesh.

864
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,660
 You want someone that for the sake of honoring God

865
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,060
 and honoring you will go to war against that

866
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,340
 which wants to destroy the very ones he loves.

867
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,200
 That's what you want.

868
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
 Now for fear of the ladies

869
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,620
 thinking they're getting off the hook,

870
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,660
 let me speak to you for a moment.

871
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,700
 In the book of Proverbs,

872
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,460
 we meet a character by the title of the adulterous woman.

873
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,100
 And what you know is that there are three primary

874
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,900
 descriptors of this lady.

875
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,460
 She has smooth speech,

876
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,500
 a seductive appearance,

877
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,860
 and a cold conscience.

878
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,540
 And so ladies, you be careful

879
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,080
 in the way that you speak to men.

880
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,060
 You be considerate of it.

881
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,520
 Don't sex them just because it makes you feel secure.

882
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,020
 It's nice to be liked.

883
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,400
 You actually feel wanted.

884
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,680
 Don't do that.

885
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,280
 Don't flirt with them just because,

886
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,180
 man, I like having someone on the hook.

887
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,840
 It gives me some sense of validation.

888
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,060
 You be careful with the way you speak.

889
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,960
 So much has said about modesty in the church

890
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,280
 and that you need to be careful how you dress.

891
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,440
 I am blown away by the things

892
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,560
 that I see girls wear in the gym.

893
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,800
 Not just because that can't be possibly comfortable

894
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,040
 to lift in, but because it's so sad.

895
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,660
 It's a living testament to the fact

896
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,340
 that they want the affirmation and approval of a man

897
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,760
 when they have a God that wants to give them

898
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,500
 affirmation and approval already.

899
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,720
 The curves of your body are not meant for us.

900
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,500
 They are meant for your husband.

901
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,980
 So save them for him.

902
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,160
 And lastly,

903
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,800
 if you're here and you're prone to preying on innocent men

904
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,660
 because there's something empowering about showing them

905
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,060
 the sexual ropes as opposed to always being shown yourself,

906
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,600
 then you be careful because that is the fast road

907
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,400
 to deadening your conscience before God.

908
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,280
 Don't do that.

909
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,480
 Now, as I say all of this,

910
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,400
 here's what I know happens in the room.

911
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,000
 Like I can feel the cloud of guilt

912
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
 that hangs over some of you

913
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,920
 because you've done some of this.

914
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,640
 You've done worse than this.

915
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,020
 Let me just say, not as a preacher at the porch,

916
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,740
 but hopefully a pastor to you,

917
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,320
 I have done things too.

918
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,580
 We do not regard people in light of what they've done.

919
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,060
 We regard people in light of how far they've come.

920
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,200
 That's what it means to have the grace of Jesus for someone.

921
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,080
 And so if you're here and you're like, man,

922
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,240
 when they learn what I've done,

923
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,560
 when they see the places I've been,

924
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,800
 when I have to unpack my body count at some point,

925
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,040
 they're gonna run out.

926
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,980
 If they run out, then good riddance to them.

927
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,040
 They don't know the love of God.

928
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,540
 They don't know the grace of Jesus,

929
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,960
 which extends to the very worst of you.

930
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,860
 You're not too far gone.

931
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,440
 Christ, he looks at the adulterous woman and he says,

932
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,960
 has no one condemned you?

933
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,080
 Then do not condemn yourself

934
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,240
 for what I have not condemned you of.

935
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,000
 He says you're free.

936
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,400
 He denied himself so that you might be beloved.

937
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,320
 And now you get to deny yourself from this day forward

938
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,960
 for the sake of your beloved.

939
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,880
 And then the last principle I'll give you

940
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,920
 is don't be reckless.

941
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,200
 Do be respectful.

942
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,340
 Romans 12.10 says, love one another with brotherly affection

943
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,860
 which can also be interpreted as respect.

944
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,340
 Outdo one another in showing honor.

945
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,540
 Matthew 7.12 says, so whatever you wish

946
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,100
 that others would do to you, do also to them

947
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,000
 for this is the law and the prophets.

948
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,980
 I'll be quick because I know that we're coming

949
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,420
 to the end of this thing.

950
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,460
 When I was preparing this message,

951
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,200
 I found it so fascinating.

952
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,700
 I was doing a little bit of research on toxic relationships

953
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,940
 and what I found is that all toxic relationships

954
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,180
 early in their existence share the same primary indicator.

955
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,480
 You wanna know what it is?

956
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,860
 A lack of respect between one or both parties.

957
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,540
 You see, most if not all unhealthy relationships,

958
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,780
 they are formed under the failure

959
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,080
 of recognizing the other person's value.

960
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,600
 And every person has value

961
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,540
 because they have been made in God's image.

962
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,340
 They have a God-given dignity.

963
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,260
 And so in relationship, we should recognize that

964
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,540
 and treat one another in kind.

965
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,940
 You see, in unhealthy relationships,

966
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,780
 instead of being marked by mutual admiration

967
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,540
 for one another, what you often see

968
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,420
 is a gradual manipulation of the other

969
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,060
 where one person uses the other

970
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,760
 to get from them what they want.

971
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,660
 I was thinking about this as I stood over there

972
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,220
 before coming on the stage, looking at this room

973
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,180
 and reeling with the statistics

974
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,580
 that one in four girls before the age of 18

975
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,380
 and one in six guys before the age of 18

976
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,860
 have been sexually abused.

977
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,140
 That is a testament to the fact

978
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,840
 that we live in a world so comfortable

979
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,260
 and accommodating to unhealthy relationships

980
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,180
 and yet Christ, he makes no space

981
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,660
 for such relationships to exist.

982
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,540
 He does not want us to have toxic relationships

983
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,360
 with one another.

984
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,160
 No, he wants us to have redemptive relationships

985
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,660
 with one another where we consider one another

986
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,740
 rightly, we treat one another with respect.

987
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,660
 And the reason we can do that is because we know

988
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,180
 where an unhealthy relationship will look at someone else

989
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,540
 and they will claim some sense of identity over them.

990
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,440
 We know, under God, until you're married,

991
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,780
 that person, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,

992
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,380
 whatever title you wanna put on your relationship,

993
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,300
 that person is not yours.

994
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,180
 They are God's and also they will be somebody's.

995
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,020
 And so as a result, you should treat them with respect.

996
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,900
 I'll end with this.

997
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:41,900
 When Brooke and I got to the end of our relationship,

998
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,620
 by that time, I had made a bunch of mistakes

999
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,960
 over the course of my dating history.

1000
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,620
 And yet when we met in college,

1001
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,340
 having learned some of these principles

1002
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,100
 through spiritual mentors,

1003
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,300
 we made a commitment to one another.

1004
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,940
 We wanna do this thing right.

1005
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,940
 And I remember the day that I went to her father

1006
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,780
 to ask his blessing for her hand in marriage,

1007
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,660
 I could do so with a guilt-free conscience

1008
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,060
 because we did it.

1009
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,940
 We did it right.

1010
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,640
 Now, to be very clear, we did it imperfectly.

1011
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,000
 And yet we had entrusted ourselves

1012
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,360
 over the course of our relationship to a God

1013
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,600
 that had done all of this perfectly himself.

1014
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,600
 You see, in Jesus, when we were isolated, he was inclusive.

1015
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,920
 He looked upon a people that did not want him

1016
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,000
 and he said, "I will give myself for your sake

1017
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,240
 "to bring you into my family.

1018
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,780
 "I want you to be with my people

1019
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,640
 "associated amongst the brothers and sisters

1020
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,840
 "in God's name."

1021
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,020
 When we were critical, we see in Christ one who was kind,

1022
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,140
 one that sought us even when we didn't deserve it.

1023
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,080
 He moved towards us with a kind of steadfast and loyal love

1024
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,580
 that said, "I will go any length to get them.

1025
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,220
 "It doesn't matter what they've done.

1026
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,760
 "It doesn't matter how far they've fallen.

1027
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,220
 "It doesn't matter the gravest, darkest secret

1028
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,440
 "in their past, I will lay my life down for them

1029
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,840
 "and I will seek them at every cost

1030
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,640
 "because I am kind to them.

1031
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,440
 "They don't deserve my kindness,

1032
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,940
 "but I will lavish upon them a kindness

1033
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,960
 "that they have not known, that once they know it,

1034
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,600
 "they might love me and live in light of it

1035
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,760
 "the rest of their days."

1036
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,360
 We see in Jesus that when we were naive,

1037
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,360
 wayward, wandering in our sin, he was vigilant.

1038
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,080
 He gave no ground.

1039
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,760
 He stood right where we meant to stand.

1040
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,360
 He endured our punishment against our sin

1041
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,240
 by absorbing God's wrath upon our cross

1042
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,600
 because he wanted to fight for the one whom he loved.

1043
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,880
 That's our God.

1044
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,240
 That's your king.

1045
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,720
 That's your husband.

1046
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,520
 He's one who says, "I will be vigilant in their place.

1047
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,640
 "I will fight away that which seeks to destroy

1048
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,980
 "the ones whom I love.

1049
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,400
 "I will do so at the greatest cost."

1050
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,840
 And then we see in Jesus that while we were reckless,

1051
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 he was respectful in that he honored God

1052
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,080
 and he fulfilled the purposes for which he was sent.

1053
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,080
 And he has honored you in that when you did not deserve it,

1054
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,040
 were not worthy of it,

1055
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,760
 he lavishes love upon you anyways.

1056
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,720
 This is the love of God.

1057
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,360
 If you want to make dating easier,

1058
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
