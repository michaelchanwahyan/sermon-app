 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix,

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,640
 Nashville, Austin, Houston, wherever you are listening in from tonight.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,760
 We are wrapping up this series, Jesus Walks, so

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,840
 there will no longer be a Kanye West intro bumper.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,040
 Sadly, unless we start next week's series off with that, which maybe who knows.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,760
 So if you're listening online, you can't hear that because we don't have the

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,880
 copyright rights to it, so you just heard some other tune on there.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 But hey, either way, we are finishing up this series.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,080
 And anybody live in the M Streets in this area?

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,000
 Good, three of you, awesome.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,360
 The epicenter of young adults.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,280
 Hey, when my wife and I got married, we moved into a place that's duplex in

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,280
 the M Streets, which if you're listening, is just an area of Dallas that is kind

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,000
 of a lot of young adults, families, it's kind of South Dallas by Mockingbird.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,560
 It's not really the point, but point being, we moved into this duplex, and

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
 it was the first home that we lived in together.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,840
 We got ready to move everything in.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
 We met the guy who was living there before us, and while he was moving,

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
 he said, hey, this TV is attached to the wall.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 I don't really wanna take it down.

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,840
 I'm moving to Chicago.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,400
 I'm gonna be in a place where I can't really use it.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,760
 I'll give you guys a great deal.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,720
 This was when smart TVs were really brand new, and so it was not just a smart TV.

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
 It was like the nicest TV I'd ever seen.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,360
 He gave it to us at basically half off.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,480
 It was like sold, and it had this feature to it that I'd never seen before.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,040
 I still haven't seen it to this day, where you could watch any show you want in 3D.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
 You guys seen this before?

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,080
 No?

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
 Yes, some of you have?

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,000
 I don't even know if this is a thing, but on this TV, you could watch any TV show

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,960
 that you wanted to in 3D, but there was one catch to it.

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,240
 In order to watch it, you had to put on the 3D glasses in order to watch.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,560
 And these weren't like the 3D glasses from the 1990s when you were in the IMAX theater.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
 These were like next level.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,920
 You gotta turn them on.

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,040
 They basically look like they come from NASA or something, and they allow you to watch any TV show

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,880
 that you want in total 3D.

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,040
 So you, like, sit there, you're watching The Office, and it's like they're coming out of the TV at you,

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,760
 or whatever show, Parks and Rec, whatever your thing is, you can watch these shows,

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,320
 and it's all in three dimension.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,960
 The funny thing is, it's not that practical, because as great as it sounds on the surface,

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,560
 like as a dude and just like someone who likes tech stuff, I was like,

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,880
 "Babe, this is gonna be amazing.

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,400
 We're gonna watch everything in 3D.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
 We're gonna watch the news.

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,920
 It's gonna be coming out at us."

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,560
 And it's very impractical, because you'd be shocked how often your wife is not like,

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
 "All right, I'm ready.

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,560
 Go."

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 You know?

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
 It's like, we use it like three times.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,120
 But those three times we did use it, or I tried to...

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
 I was more of a buyer than she was.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,440
 So she would come in, and I would be watching something in 3D, and she'd be like,

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,600
 "What are you watching right now?"

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,160
 And she wouldn't put the glasses on, and she would begin to like try to make out exactly what's

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
 happening, because you can kind of see it.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,960
 It's fuzzy, if you remember seeing things in 3D.

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,280
 But until you put those glasses on, everything's out of focus.

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
 It's hard to make out exactly what's going on.

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,840
 So if you're watching a movie, and you don't have the glasses on, it's hard to exactly see what's

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,920
 happening, because not everything is in...or most things are not in focus, and just like it's a warped,

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
 it's a fuzzier perspective on what's taking place.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,680
 And the reason I start there is because in that same way, without having the ability,

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,400
 without putting on the lenses of the 3D glasses to see in a 3D TV, in this series,

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,160
 "Jesus Walks," what we've been attempting to do is look at what the gospel writers,

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,200
 inside of the New Testament, the gospel writers means Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,600
 what they essentially were attempting to do.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,320
 And as we collectively look together, and to see or to find in focus Jesus.

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,000
 In other words, when we read the stories and lives and the different things that we've been going

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,200
 through the past six weeks, what we've been attempting to do is help the image of who Jesus is,

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,960
 his character, his characteristics, all of those things go from kind of this fuzzy,

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,400
 abstract, "I kind of know who Jesus is," to putting you in front of...or putting him in front

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
 of you and in front of me, and us looking and seeing, "Man, this is actually what Jesus is like.

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,400
 When he walked on this planet, when Jesus walked, this is what he was like."

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,180
 There's few tragedies that maybe could be worse than someone who spends time in church,

81
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,400
 maybe grew up in church, maybe claims to be a Christian, and having a fuzzy or a flawed

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
 or warped view of what Jesus is like.

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,360
 A lot of us came into the room tonight, and it's as though you have some idea of what Jesus is like.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,200
 You may have grown up in church, you know some of the Bible stories,

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,280
 you know kind of what he's like, but you have a fuzzy picture of him.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,320
 Like for you, you may not describe it this way, but when you think about God,

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,280
 when you think about Jesus, you think of some, like, sheriff up in the sky who's just kind

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,020
 of waiting to pull you over if you get too much out of line.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,320
 He's waiting to send down lightning bolts, and he's almost like a referee that's there to,

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,420
 like, call you out and punish you whenever you go out of bounds or you step off sides.

91
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,640
 Others of you may think of God, I mean, this is a really common one,

92
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,000
 where the perspective that you have is fuzzy and it's flawed, and you think of God almost

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,800
 like this, like, hippie God up in the sky who's kind of like, "Dude, love is love.

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
 It's all chill.

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,400
 Do whatever you want in whatever windmill.

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,080
 It's all cool."

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,320
 And that's how you think of God.

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,280
 But regardless, all of us came into the room, and to the degree that we do not see Jesus

99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,920
 as he is, to that degree, our life, our experience of where meaning is found,

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,000
 our experience of what is important in this life and really what matters in the end is

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,640
 going to be flawed.

102
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,160
 Your ability to experience joy, your experience of anxiety is all directly

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
 connected to your ability and my ability to see Jesus, to know who he is,

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,040
 to know what he's like.

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,680
 Because in knowing what he is like, it puts everything else in life into focus.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,240
 It begins to bring all the fuzziness of what life is about into focus,

107
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
 just like putting 3D glasses on.

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,000
 So tonight, we're going to look at three interactions that the resurrected Jesus has

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,360
 as we finish this series.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,640
 We're going to be in John 20 and John 21.

111
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,920
 I'm going to hammer home this idea of 3D because we're going to look at 3D adjectives,

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,440
 or three words that start with the letter D, that showcase his interactions with these

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,120
 three men and women on Jesus's resurrection day.

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,360
 Specifically, we're going to look at how Jesus welcomes the desperate,

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
 we welcomes the doubting, and how Jesus is a God.

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,680
 The God who's there is a God who welcomes the disgrace of people.

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
 We're going to look at these three adjectives, and hopefully,

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,920
 by the end of the night, all of us have a little bit more clear

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,560
 perspective as we just open and we read from John, one of Jesus's best friends.

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 This is what the Son of God, this is what God in the flesh is really like.

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,920
 And if you come to know him, this is who you're going to get to come to know.

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,160
 So we're going to look at the first one that comes from John 20.

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,120
 It's one of my favorite stories in this whole series that we're covering.

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
 It's honestly one of those stories that, for whatever reason,

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,240
 it, like, emotionally connects with me in a way that I don't even know that I can put

126
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,640
 it into words, but there's just something so powerful as we look at Jesus's

127
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,000
 interaction with this desperate woman.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,960
 So let me set up what's happening in verse...

129
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
 We'll pick it up in verse 11, but here's what happens.

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,000
 So Jesus dies, he goes to the cross, he's crucified, he's buried inside of a tomb.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
 We read the story and we think like in light of the ending, because we kind of all

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,600
 know the ending, they're like, "Yeah, guys, everything, you know,

133
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
 Sunday's coming, that's it."

134
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,000
 When they were experiencing the story, the disciples, the followers of Jesus,

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
 the woman we're about to look at who is a follower of Jesus,

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
 they don't think like we think.

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,520
 In other words, sometimes I think that we think that the disciples, you know,

138
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,640
 "Jesus is dead," but they're like, "Hey, it's going to be great.

139
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
 He's coming back.

140
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,320
 Sunday's coming."

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,200
 And they gathered outside of the tomb for a big tailgate and they're like waiting

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,480
 for Sunday and all of a sudden the ground's rumbling and they're like,

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,760
 "It's come, 10, 9, and so Jesus is going to bust out."

144
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
 And they're like, "He's here."

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,880
 They didn't see it that way.

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 They thought it was over.

147
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,760
 The guy that they've been following for the last three years,

148
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,640
 the guy that they've seen raise dead people to life, give sight to blind eyes,

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,840
 he's dead.

150
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,600
 He was the guy who was going to conquer the Roman Empire.

151
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,720
 He was the guy who was going to turn everything around for our country,

152
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
 for our people, for us.

153
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
 And if we followed him, we'd live forever.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,520
 Now, he doesn't even live forever.

155
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,280
 I mean, their world is shattered.

156
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,240
 And so early on the first day of the week, which is Sunday,

157
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,440
 that's the third day, we're told that Mary goes to the tomb.

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
 She's going to the burial site.

159
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,800
 This is essentially akin to somebody going to the burial place of someone that they

160
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,760
 love and, you know, you go, you bring flowers.

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's kind of a place where you have closure.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,520
 She goes to the tomb, and it's early in the morning on Sunday.

163
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,680
 And she gets to the tomb, and she sees what all of us know that she sees,

164
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
 but she didn't see it coming.

165
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,560
 The stone is rolled away.

166
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,080
 The tomb, when they buried Jesus, it's empty.

167
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,760
 She takes off running.

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
 She goes and gets John and Peter, and she brings both of them,

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
 and all of them come back to the tomb.

170
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,720
 And Peter and John were told they look in, and they're all just confused on what

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
 happened.

172
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,480
 And we think, "Of course you know what happened.

173
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,120
 He rose from the dead."

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
 That's not what they thought.

175
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,000
 She begins to explain, like, "Frantically, somebody has stolen the

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
 body of Jesus."

177
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,160
 The one thing in this life that I had, I mean, I just lost the guy that I banked

178
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
 everything on.

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,400
 And now I don't even have a place where I can come bring flowers at his grave because

180
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
 they stole the body.

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
 And she begins to weep, so let's pick it up in verse 11.

182
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,120
 "Now Mary stood outside of the tomb crying."

183
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,760
 The word "crying" there is "kaleo" in Greek.

184
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
 It's not the ordinary crying.

185
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,640
 It's literally translated "sobbing" or "wailing out loud."

186
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,560
 This is like she's full-blown ugly cry right now going on.

187
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,760
 She's just losing it.

188
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,520
 She thinks the body of Jesus is gone, the one last thing that she had.

189
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,560
 As she bent over to look into the tomb, she saw two angels in white seated there

190
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,160
 where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
 And they asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,360
 "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I do not know where they have put him."

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,200
 At this, she turned around and she saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that

194
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 it was Jesus.

195
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,440
 And he asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?

196
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,040
 Who is it that you are looking for?"

197
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,520
 Thinking that Jesus was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away,

198
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,560
 tell me where you have put him and I will get him."

199
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,560
 And Jesus said to her, "Mary," and she turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni,"

200
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
 which means "teacher."

201
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,520
 We're told that Jesus says her name, she realizes it's Jesus, and she throws her arms around

202
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,000
 him in the next verses and he holds on to her, or she holds on to him and Jesus says,

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,520
 "Hey, I've got to go ascend and go tell other people, 'Don't hold on to me.'"

204
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:59,720
 And we're given a glimpse into how God deals with the desperate.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,280
 We're given really a parallel into your story if you're a Christian and my story as a Christian.

206
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
 What do I mean by that?

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,080
 Mary, Mary Magdalene, there's a lot of Marys in the Bible.

208
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,800
 I don't know if you know this, there's like Mary the mother of Jesus, there's Mary the

209
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,320
 mother of Cleopas, whoever that was.

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
 There's different Marys that played roles.

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
 There's Mary in Luke 7 who breaks kind of the perfume and rubs it on Jesus' feet, but

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
 Mary Magdalene, dude, this girl had a story.

213
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
 What do I mean?

214
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,880
 In Luke chapter 8, we're told Mary Magdalene became a follower of Jesus and it was after

215
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,920
 Jesus healed her from seven demon possessions that she was a woman who was possessed by

216
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,480
 seven demons.

217
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,080
 Now when you're possessed by one demon, that's a bad day.

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,960
 When you've got seven, you've got a holiday inn of demons running on your house.

219
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,200
 That can't be good.

220
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,680
 And yet Jesus shows up to this woman, and we're not even told the story of how it all

221
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,640
 went down, but she shows up, she meets Jesus one day, and we're told that he casts out

222
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,020
 the demons, he healed this woman, her whole world changed, everything changed.

223
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,960
 She followed him for years, for the few years that he was around on this planet, and she

224
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
 believed he was the Messiah, he was everything.

225
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,080
 She banged everything on this guy.

226
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,120
 And now he's dead and it's over and it's gone.

227
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,520
 And who he thought she was, or who she thought Jesus was, she's thinking, "I was wrong."

228
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,000
 She's confused.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,420
 We're told that she's so desperate, I mean, it almost reads, what we're told is that Peter

230
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,680
 and John, like they go to the tomb, they're like, "Man, what happened?

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,240
 I guess let's go back to our life."

232
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,800
 Mary doesn't go anywhere.

233
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,480
 It's like she didn't have a life to go back to.

234
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,040
 And she's just weeping and bawling.

235
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,760
 You know the last person that the cross was?

236
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,560
 Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

237
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,240
 I mean, I think the power of just the story, it almost makes it like emotional, just he

238
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,360
 was everything.

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,640
 And now I'm weeping because everything that I thought about world, the world, the reality,

240
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,480
 where life is found, it's all been shattered.

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:21,240
 And in a moment, everything changes with a word where Jesus says, "Mary," and she realizes,

242
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
 "Who is speaking to me?"

243
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,920
 He's alive.

244
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,520
 He rose from the dead, just like he said he would, though he didn't fully understand it.

245
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,440
 And everything in a moment changes.

246
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,280
 The reason it's such a parallel to the Christian experience is the Bible says that Jesus is

247
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,960
 a good shepherd in John chapter 10, and it says he's a shepherd that he calls his sheep

248
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 by name, and they know his voice, and they follow him.

249
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,420
 And Mary did what every Christian who's ever lived did in that moment where Jesus speaks

250
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,040
 their name, and in doing so, awakens their eyes to see he's alive.

251
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,920
 He's who he said he was.

252
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,760
 He's the Messiah, the Savior, the Savior of my sins.

253
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
 Mary was desperate.

254
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 In the Christian, what does desperate mean?

255
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,400
 It means I'll go to great extremes because I have great need.

256
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
 I have nowhere else to turn, nowhere else to look to.

257
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,880
 And in similar parallel fashion, the Christian life begins by you understanding that you

258
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
 are desperate.

259
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,720
 Jesus welcomes the desperate into having a relationship with him.

260
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
 What do I mean by desperate?

261
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,120
 I mean like Mary, those who realize they have a great need.

262
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
 We're desperate in our own way.

263
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,200
 And if you're ever going to become a Christian, it comes by you starting to realize, "Man,

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,120
 I am desperate and in need of a God to save me.

265
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,720
 If I'm going to have a relationship with God, it is not by me doing a bunch of good things.

266
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,920
 It is by God in his mercy, in an unexplained, undeserving way, calling my name and allowing

267
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
 me to see he's alive."

268
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,880
 That's what Christians believe.

269
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 You know that, right?

270
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,040
 I think that the fuzzy view, if you will, to use that illustration of 3D stuff, the

271
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,440
 fuzzy dimension is the perspective that many people in our world have where they kind of

272
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,360
 think they can see what's going on.

273
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,080
 And here's what that looks like as it relates to desperate.

274
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,880
 They think that God, the God who's there, doesn't welcome the desperate, which is the

275
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 first point.

276
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,920
 He's a God who welcomes those who have it all together.

277
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,440
 He's a God who welcomes those who kind of live pretty good lives.

278
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,920
 And that's the type of person that God welcomes into his arms.

279
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,520
 And the Bible says the only ones that have a relationship with Jesus are those who say,

280
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
 "I am in need.

281
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,300
 I bring nothing to the table, and yet God accepts me.

282
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,120
 No matter how good of a person I think I am, no matter how bad I am, none of that matters.

283
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,280
 " In terms of having a relationship with Jesus, and he goes and he welcomes the desperate.

284
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,080
 And it's only those who see themselves as desperate who will have a relationship with

285
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 him.

286
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:52,120
 In so many ways, he operates distinctly opposite of how most of us interact with someone that

287
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,400
 we perceive to be desperate as it relates to having a relationship.

288
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 You know what I mean?

289
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,000
 Like whenever you're dating somebody, we've all been in that experience, or a lot of us

290
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,240
 have been in this experience where you sit down and like in two seconds, you're like,

291
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,440
 "Dude, this person is desperate."

292
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,000
 And is there anything less attractive when they're like, "Hey, look, okay.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,840
 I've got a note on my phone with the names of our children that if we just ended up working

294
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,280
 out together, and I'm just hoping that this will be great.

295
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
 Really whatever you think about life, I'm great.

296
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 I'm just looking for a...

297
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,440
 I'm looking to get booed up.

298
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,040
 And so if this is something that you're open to, is there anything less attractive than

299
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,960
 someone who's like, "Look, I got no other options."

300
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,560
 They're texting you every five seconds.

301
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,680
 You've been on one date and they're showing up to your work like, "Hey, I'm just changing

302
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,160
 things in your office and this is going to be great."

303
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,580
 Is there anything where you're like, "Oh man, that girl, she has got seven kinds of crazy

304
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,720
 going on and it's unattractive.

305
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 It's weird."

306
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,040
 Like being honest, dude, some of you guys don't text back immediately even though you

307
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
 see the text when it's someone of the opposite sex, because you're like, "Look, I don't want

308
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
 to come off too intense.

309
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
 And so I'm going to let it lie for a second.

310
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,040
 And so maybe I'll cause the dots to leave them wanting a little bit."

311
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 Am I right?

312
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,280
 Because if somebody's desperate, we're like, we know people don't want to have a relationship

313
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,800
 if somebody's desperate.

314
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,200
 The only type of people that Jesus will have a relationship with are those who are desperate.

315
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,880
 Those who see their need for a savior.

316
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
 Those who don't say, "Man, I bring a lot to the table and you know, God, I've been doing

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,840
 a lot of good things, know a lot of Bible verses, go to church a lot here at the porch."

318
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,160
 That should earn me a relationship with you.

319
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,120
 That is not what the Bible teaches.

320
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,940
 It teaches that God is there, welcomes those who see themselves as God.

321
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,960
 You alone are the only hope that I have of eternal life.

322
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,960
 If I'm going to have access to knowing and walking with you, it's not going to be by

323
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,440
 how good of a person I am.

324
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,000
 But Jesus shows us the first D, which is that he's a God who welcomes the desperate.

325
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,080
 Second story comes, and it's probably more familiar to, it's related to a guy who ended

326
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,840
 up getting a nickname.

327
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,320
 And that was around the idea of doubting.

328
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 And that is doubting, anybody know?

329
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 Thomas.

330
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 Come on, dude.

331
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
 We've got some Bible scholars here.

332
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,320
 Thomas brings us our second D and we're told that there was a, later on this day.

333
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,040
 So that morning he appears to Mary and then later that night, Jesus goes and he goes to

334
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,440
 see the disciples and they're hanging out in what's called the upper room.

335
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,560
 Like they were just up there.

336
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
 They didn't know what was happening.

337
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
 They didn't know what to do now.

338
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,000
 Jesus there, the one that they banked their life on is dead.

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,320
 So they think, and they're hanging out and it says that they've got the doors locked

340
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,160
 because they're afraid of what the religious leaders are going to do to us.

341
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,480
 We just saw what they did to Jesus.

342
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,280
 They're all hanging out and Jesus shows up and he like straight walks through the wall

343
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 and he's like, "What's up guys?"

344
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
 It's like savage Jesus.

345
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
 He just comes through the wall.

346
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
 I don't need a door.

347
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 I don't need anything.

348
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 And he's totally resurrected.

349
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,720
 Like it's not like some ghost or anything.

350
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
 In fact, they're like, "Oh man, is this a ghost?"

351
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,280
 And Jesus is like, "No, touch me.

352
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
 This is real deal."

353
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
 In fact, is that fish right there?

354
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,440
 And he begins to eat some of the food to like show or it displays, man, it's totally resurrected

355
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
 physical body.

356
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,320
 It's not some ghost, but there was one disciple not there.

357
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 Thomas.

358
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,080
 Thomas was out getting pita bread or whatever, you know, the grocery store they had back

359
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,400
 then and he missed it.

360
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,360
 And he comes back home and all the disciples are like, "Dude, you just missed Jesus.

361
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,560
 Jesus was just here."

362
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,800
 Like he was here, we're hanging out and he like showed up in the room, was like, "You

363
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 got any fish?"

364
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 It was crazy.

365
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,160
 And he let us see the scars in his hands and on his side.

366
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
 And Thomas basically goes, "You guys are crazy.

367
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
 I will not believe that."

368
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,160
 Here's what it says.

369
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:40,360
 So when the other disciples, verse 25 of chapter 20, told him that we have seen the Lord, but

370
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,520
 he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and I put my finger where the

371
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,440
 nails were and I put my hand into his side, I will not believe."

372
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,160
 A week later, his disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them.

373
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,880
 Though the doors were locked, Jesus came in and he stood among them and he said, "Peace

374
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,240
 be with you."

375
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,760
 And then he turned to Thomas, the one who had doubted him, the one who had seen everything

376
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,320
 that he had done, the one who demanded that he prove himself to Thomas.

377
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,120
 And what does he say?

378
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,400
 "Thomas, put your finger here in my hand.

379
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,920
 Reach out your hand and put it into my side.

380
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,240
 Stop doubting and believe."

381
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,720
 And Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God."

382
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,040
 And then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you believed."

383
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,920
 And he says something that's true about you if you're a Christian, which is next.

384
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:54,960
 "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

385
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,040
 The amount of humility it would take to be God in the flesh and to say, "Man, I'm going

386
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,360
 to go out of my way to go back to care for Thomas," this one doubting person.

387
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,200
 He doesn't shun Thomas for his doubts.

388
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,520
 He doesn't dismiss him.

389
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
 It doesn't disqualify him.

390
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,360
 He moves towards him as though God is like, "Man, that's okay.

391
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 Come here.

392
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,400
 You can come see it."

393
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,200
 The God who's there, the second idea, the second D in the 3D is that the God who's there

394
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,360
 is a God who welcomes the doubting.

395
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,740
 He welcomes the doubting.

396
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,220
 And Thomas sees Jesus and it's as though he puts on the glasses and he sees more clearly,

397
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,380
 "My God, my Lord."

398
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,700
 But what you need to know, if you're in the room, Jesus doesn't shun or shy away from

399
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,380
 those who have doubts.

400
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,660
 He moves towards them.

401
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,660
 He's a God who welcomes it.

402
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,380
 If you have doubts and you've ever experienced doubts, here's what you need to know.

403
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
 You are in great company.

404
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,300
 In other words, sometimes, like the message, people like feel if they're a Christian and

405
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,580
 they're in church, they feel like, "Man, I can't even be honest about the fact that sometimes

406
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,900
 I'm like, 'Dude, I don't know if I believe everything exactly inside of this book or

407
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,180
 I just have questions that I feel like I can't be honest and wrestle with.'"

408
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,820
 And that is a lie.

409
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
 You don't need to be ashamed.

410
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
 You don't need to be afraid.

411
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,580
 You don't need to be unwilling to explore or to ask questions to seek answers to those

412
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,340
 questions.

413
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,460
 And you need to know that God, while you're doing so and as you do so, because all of

414
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,180
 us are going to face doubts in life and anyone who tells you you won't is a liar.

415
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,420
 But while you do so, you need to know that God doesn't shun you.

416
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,100
 He welcomes the doubting.

417
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,980
 And so if there's questions you're wondering, here would be the practical encouragement

418
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,260
 that I would give you.

419
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,900
 Seek answers to the questions.

420
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,180
 Like there are libraries and books and all kinds of resources to questions.

421
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,340
 The worst thing you can do is to stop on doubt.

422
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,020
 It's like playing a board game of Monopoly and, "Hey, don't stop on doubt.

423
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,860
 Don't stop on doubt."

424
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,620
 Let those drive you towards seeking answers to the questions.

425
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
 Here's what's true.

426
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,780
 If Christianity is true, you don't need to be afraid of asking questions.

427
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,140
 Like it's not like you're going to pull the one card and everything, the whole thing collapses.

428
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
 Ask questions.

429
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,300
 Seek answers to your questions.

430
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,940
 It's been said that if something is true, no amount of scrutiny can take it down.

431
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
 And so ask questions.

432
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,820
 And if you can't ask questions and we can't be certain that it's true, dude, we should

433
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,860
 shut this whole thing down and find a much better place to go on a Tuesday night.

434
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,700
 There's probably a good happy hour deal somewhere or there's something else that we could do.

435
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,160
 But if it is true, then there's no better use of our time than knowing God and walking

436
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,180
 with his people, seeking to live on purpose for him.

437
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,860
 But you do not need to be afraid of asking questions.

438
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,820
 All throughout the New Testament, there's people who experienced doubt.

439
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,300
 We're told that John the Baptist, you guys heard of John the Baptist?

440
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
 He's not the first Baptist.

441
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,220
 He just was a guy that baptized people.

442
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,620
 And John showed up and we're told Jesus said, "Hey, there's never been someone born of a

443
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,140
 woman," which is everybody, "who is greater than John."

444
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,220
 And in John's last days on the planet, he sends a letter to Jesus, who he knew his whole

445
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,740
 life, who he was raised up with, who was his cousin.

446
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,740
 And he says, "I'm sitting in this jail cell.

447
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,300
 I just need to know, Jesus, are you sure you're the Messiah?

448
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,500
 Because I feel like if you were, you would change my circumstances right now."

449
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 And in the face of pain and disappointment, he doubted.

450
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,260
 We're even told that the disciples in Matthew chapter eight, as Jesus gives a great commission,

451
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
 remember the great commission?

452
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,620
 It's a really famous, you've probably heard it.

453
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,140
 Go into all the world and make disciples and baptize them in the name of the Father, the

454
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,940
 Son, and the Holy Spirit, and lo, I'm with you always to the end of the age.

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,760
 As he's doing that, we're told that Jesus ascends to heaven.

456
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,220
 And as he does, it tells us in the text that the disciples were gathered around and watching

457
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,100
 Jesus ascend, kind of levitate up towards heaven.

458
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,300
 And as he's doing so, it says, "And they saw him, and some worshipped him, and some doubted."

459
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,980
 Think about that.

460
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,620
 They're seeing Jesus levitate up in the air, and some are like, "Ah, I don't know.

461
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,380
 David Blaine does the same thing.

462
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,340
 I'm not totally convinced."

463
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
 I mean, think about it.

464
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,500
 Like, you may be sitting here, and you're like, "Did he really ascend?

465
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 What was that like?

466
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,780
 I wish I could have seen that."

467
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,340
 People who saw that doubted.

468
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,860
 Did he really do it?

469
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,140
 And so you need to know, and those were disciples who followed Jesus.

470
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,420
 It is a normal part of the human experience and the Christian experience to experience

471
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,780
 doubts, but it is not okay to stop on doubt.

472
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,020
 Let those doubts drive you towards seeking answers.

473
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,820
 You do not need to be afraid of the answers or of truth, because as a follower of Jesus,

474
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,580
 truth is yours, and all truth is God's.

475
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
 And so let it drive you.

476
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,820
 Here's two resources if you have questions.

477
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,380
 One is, could be just for friends you have, one is gotquestions.org.

478
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
 Gotquestions.org.

479
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,020
 There's over 500,000 different questions that have been asked.

480
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,460
 I am confident whatever question you have likely is on there.

481
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,060
 Another one is something we do the second Tuesday of the month here at The Porch called

482
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
 Great Questions.

483
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,940
 It's just a chance for, if you have questions wherever you are wrestling in terms of faith,

484
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,380
 for you to come and ask those questions.

485
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,140
 If you are someone wrestling to believe, I hear this every single week, "Man, I want

486
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,300
 to believe.

487
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,940
 I want to believe that Jesus is who he says he is.

488
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,100
 He died in my place and he rose from the grave.

489
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,340
 I'm struggling to get there.

490
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,380
 I can think it, I just don't know.

491
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,100
 I'm struggling to get there."

492
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,380
 I want you to pray one prayer just this week.

493
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,100
 "God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?

494
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,380
 God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?

495
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,140
 God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?"

496
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:43,820
 But be careful, if that is a question, he longs and often likely answers.

497
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,220
 He longs to answer and often likely does.

498
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,320
 And ultimately, at the end of the day, here's what I know.

499
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,060
 You want to know God more than you want answers to your questions.

500
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
 So do I.

501
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,820
 As much as I want to know the answers to everything, how exactly does the problem of evil and pain

502
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,300
 and all of that work and, you know, the creation, was it seven literal days and how did the

503
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,100
 dinosaurs fit on the boat?

504
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,420
 All those different great questions.

505
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,260
 There's a great answer to that one.

506
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,940
 Not that, we're not going to go there right now, but I want to know Jesus more than I

507
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,740
 want answers.

508
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
 And I know you do too.

509
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,740
 And it's not just because I'm like, "Yeah, yay, motivational."

510
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
 You do.

511
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,260
 Like, if Jesus showed up to your room tonight and he woke you up and he was like, "Hey,

512
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
 it's Jesus.

513
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,340
 What's up?"

514
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,140
 You would not pull out your list of questions and be like, "Oh, it's you.

515
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
 Huh?

516
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
 Let's start from the top."

517
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,500
 So seven literal days, you would go, "It's real.

518
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,100
 He's alive."

519
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,140
 Because you want to know him more than you want answers to your questions.

520
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,060
 We all do.

521
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,940
 And so if you're wrestling to believe, this week, the challenge I would give you is to

522
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,860
 begin to ask God, "If you're real, will you reveal yourself to me?"

523
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,460
 Ultimately, it is not the amount of your faith or the strength and size of your faith, but

524
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,140
 it is what your faith is in that matters most.

525
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
 Here's what I mean by that.

526
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,100
 Because sometimes we have this idea, the flawed, fuzzy view here, before you put on the glasses

527
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,340
 here, the fuzzy view would be that God welcomes or loves those who are just full of faith,

528
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,420
 huge amounts of faith.

529
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,180
 And the truth is, it is not how much faith that you have that matters in terms of having

530
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,620
 a relationship with God and where you spend eternity.

531
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
 It is what your faith is in.

532
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,620
 Here's what I mean.

533
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,620
 Tim Keller pointed out in a book called Reason for God, which is a great resource, if you

534
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,100
 have questions or people in general, and he pointed out that if I was on the side of a

535
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,380
 mountain and I was losing my grip on the side of the mountain, and I'm hanging there and

536
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,820
 I'm losing my grip, and I look over and I see a tree branch right there that I could

537
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,860
 grab, and if I could hold onto it, I could pull myself to safety, and I know that I'm

538
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,780
 slipping off of this thing.

539
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
 I have a decision.

540
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,140
 Am I going to grab the tree branch or just kind of fall off to my death?

541
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,260
 In that moment, what matters most is not how confident I am that that tree branch can hold

542
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
 me.

543
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,540
 If I have a lot of confidence, it'll hold me, or if I have a little bit of confidence,

544
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,260
 that it'll hold me.

545
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,580
 Matters less than if it will hold me.

546
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,140
 In other words, if I'm like, "Dude, it's for sure going to hold me," and then I grab and

547
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,780
 I fall, that matters less, or that matters more than however much confidence I have.

548
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,540
 The question is, can it hold you?

549
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,260
 The Bible says whether it is the size of a mustard seed faith or something far bigger

550
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,940
 than that, what matters most is whether or not you are holding onto Christ, because he's

551
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180
 strong enough to hold you.

552
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,460
 In other words, what saves a Christian is not the strength of their faith.

553
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,980
 It is the strength of Jesus.

554
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,400
 If you're going to have a relationship with him and know, you need to know.

555
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,500
 You don't have to deal with all of your doubts before you come to trust in Jesus.

556
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,320
 You should deal with them, and you should seek answers, and you should know it's a safe

557
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,340
 place to be filled with doubts.

558
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,580
 I have doubts at times.

559
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,020
 I have probably doubts every week, whether they're related to just different things,

560
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,300
 or what exactly all happened here.

561
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,940
 Reading some of the stuff in the Old Testament, candidly, one of the things that I doubt most

562
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,580
 is like, "God, you really love me?

563
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,420
 Really?

564
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:25,580
 Could you really be as scandalous in love as it seems to present in the Bible, and as

565
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,900
 for my good as you seem to say?"

566
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,820
 Yet those are doubts that I have the choice to, I'm either going to allow that to drive

567
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,980
 me back to seeking answers and drive me back to him, or I'm just going to stay in that

568
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
 fog and let it paralyze me.

569
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,720
 But let me be abundantly clear.

570
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,740
 Some of you, your problem is not that like, "Man, I've got these doubts, and I just can't

571
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
 find answers."

572
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,940
 You don't want answers.

573
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,100
 All the questions for some of you, not all of you, maybe not even most, but this for

574
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,540
 sure, I've just been doing this a while.

575
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,900
 There's people inside of this room that are like, "Dude, hey, it's not that I can't believe

576
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
 it's true.

577
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,380
 I don't want to believe it's true yet, because if it is, then I may have to change some things.

578
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,540
 I may have to not date the way that I've been dating, and I may have to move out with him,

579
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,460
 and I may have to make some changes in my job, and I may have to do some things differently

580
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,180
 and spend my time a little bit differently."

581
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,820
 You're like, "You just throw up the smoke screens.

582
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,460
 Well, you know we can't really trust that, and you throw up smoke screen after smoke

583
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
 screen."

584
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,860
 You don't want the answers to those questions.

585
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,420
 You just want to hide behind them, and you're missing out.

586
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,820
 That is it.

587
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
 You're missing out on purpose.

588
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,700
 You're missing out on seeing the reality of the world around you, and you stay behind

589
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,580
 that fuzzy wall, but you like it there.

590
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,820
 Just be honest.

591
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,900
 Stop hiding behind, "There's just too many doubts that I have," and just say, "I want

592
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,860
 to be my own God.

593
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,220
 I want to be God of my life, and I don't want to change things."

594
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:58,100
 Don't hide behind doubts, because if they're there, seek answers.

595
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,460
 The final D that we see as we wrap up just the 3D or three dimensions here of seeing

596
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,700
 Jesus in 3D is related to Jesus' best friend.

597
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,540
 It happens in John chapter 21 in his interaction with Peter.

598
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:20,220
 It says this, "Afterward, Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Galilee."

599
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,860
 This is the last chapter of the book of John.

600
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,740
 It happened this way.

601
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:32,540
 Simon Peter, Thomas, also known as Didymus, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of

602
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,980
 Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.

603
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,020
 Let me just pause.

604
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,260
 This is hilarious to me, because he says, this is John, right?

605
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,940
 He's like, "We had Peter there.

606
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
 We had Thomas.

607
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,060
 He was also known as Didymus, and we had Nathaniel.

608
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
 He's from Cana.

609
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,060
 That's in Galilee.

610
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
 Then we had the sons of Zebedee.

611
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,840
 Zebedee's their dad, and then there were two other guys."

612
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,120
 This is like the ultimate…

613
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,140
 When somebody posts a picture on Instagram and they tag everybody but you, only it's

614
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,740
 in the Bible for all time.

615
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,100
 It's like, "Dude, John, we got names, bro.

616
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,360
 Why didn't you mention us?"

617
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,860
 That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

618
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,720
 It just was too much shade, John.

619
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,980
 Peter said this, "I am going out to fish."

620
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,820
 They said that, "We'll go with you."

621
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,140
 They went out, and they got in the boat, but that night, they caught nothing.

622
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,920
 Peter does what so many of us do, and they face a failure and shame.

623
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,060
 We go back to our old life.

624
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,320
 We go away from God and our relationship with Him.

625
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,860
 We run from our purpose.

626
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,820
 We kind of just wallow in shame and guilt.

627
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
 Why do I say that?

628
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,900
 Because Peter, when he says, "I'm going fishing," this wasn't a dude's trip.

629
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
 This is what Peter used to do for a living.

630
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
 He was a fisherman.

631
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,940
 Until Jesus showed up one day and He said, "Peter, you're going to come with me, and

632
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,380
 you're going to fish for men, not fish."

633
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,020
 Peter follows Jesus, leaves everything behind, goes.

634
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,180
 John closes out the book of the Bible, showing us this story of Jesus welcoming even the

635
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:14,320
 disgraced, which is what Peter was and what Peter was feeling.

636
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,380
 Why do I say that?

637
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,360
 Why would you go back to your old way of living and old fishing?

638
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,280
 Peter, Jesus said, "You're the guy I'm going to build the entire church movement on.

639
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,960
 You're the guy that for the next however many thousands of years until I return, people

640
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,360
 are going to name their kids after.

641
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,360
 You're going to be the rock on which this thing is built.

642
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,480
 Your decoration of faith, that's what the name even Peter means, rock.

643
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,160
 You're the guy who is going to lead the first century church.

644
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
 That's who you are, Peter."

645
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:49,980
 And Peter, after denying Jesus three times, he goes back to fishing.

646
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,340
 He sees himself as, and what in some ways he was behaviorally, "I failed Jesus."

647
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,500
 I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.

648
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:07,180
 In Jesus' worst moment of need, Peter, who's the best friend, the leader of the disciples,

649
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,900
 Jesus gets arrested that night.

650
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,300
 Hours before, he was eating a meal with Jesus and Jesus was like, "You know, Peter, everybody

651
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,060
 here is going to abandon me."

652
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,220
 And Peter goes, "They may abandon you.

653
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,840
 I will never abandon you.

654
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,940
 Everybody else, they may abandon, but I'll die before I abandon you.

655
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,380
 I will never disown you."

656
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,740
 And Jesus says, "Before the rooster crows three times, you're going to deny me three

657
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,740
 times tonight."

658
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:41,060
 And Peter, we're told, after Jesus is arrested later in the garden when Jesus was praying,

659
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,300
 these soldiers come up and they take Jesus and they take him to a trial, kind of this

660
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,220
 courtyard outside.

661
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,740
 And Peter follows at a distance.

662
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,540
 He's afraid if they just arrested Jesus, they may arrest me.

663
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,940
 He begins to watch the trial taking place and there's this fire, we're told, by the

664
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
 courtyard.

665
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
 This is in John 18.

666
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
 It's really in all of the gospels.

667
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,660
 And he goes over to the fireplace and there's people gathered around him.

668
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,380
 He just begins to warm his hands on what they say is like a charcoal fire.

669
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,020
 And as he's warming his hands, you can see the trial happening.

670
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,980
 And somebody goes, "Wait a second.

671
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
 You're with Jesus.

672
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,340
 You were one of his followers, aren't you?"

673
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,660
 And he says, "No, no, I've never heard the guy.

674
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,620
 No, you got me mistaken for somebody else."

675
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,700
 And then a middle school girl comes up.

676
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,980
 The girl was like 12 years old and she's like, "Hey, you were with Jesus that one day, weren't

677
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
 you?"

678
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
 And he says, "No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
 Wrong guy.

680
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
 You're looking for John."

681
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,260
 He totally just denies it.

682
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,140
 And then a third person comes up and we're told that he begins to yell out curses.

683
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,020
 "I'm not with this man."

684
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,700
 Likely curses on Jesus.

685
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,540
 And in that moment, the rooster crowed.

686
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,060
 And we're told that Jesus looked like he looked across the courtyard and he saw him.

687
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,780
 And Peter went out and he just wept and wept.

688
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,860
 There's no mention of Peter coming to see Jesus crucified.

689
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:05,460
 He went and then his shame and guilt ran from his savior.

690
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,980
 And so when he goes fishing, it's clearly a declaration of, "Man, God has done with

691
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,460
 me.

692
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,460
 He chose me and he told me that I would do all these things and I abandoned him.

693
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,820
 I'm the biggest failure of all the disciples," which he was.

694
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,700
 And Jesus shows up as the men are out there fishing.

695
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,340
 This is in the chapter.

696
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
 And he stands on the shore that morning.

697
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,500
 He says, "Hey, guys, did you catch any fish?"

698
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,340
 And he yells out to the disciples in the boat.

699
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
 They can't tell that it's Jesus.

700
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,460
 And he says, "Hey, throw the net on the other side."

701
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,380
 And they throw the net on the other side and it says they catch so many fish that they

702
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,740
 can't even pull it into the boat.

703
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,860
 They just got to drag it all the way to shore.

704
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,180
 And they get to the shore and they realize it's Jesus.

705
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,700
 And this is what happens next.

706
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:56,980
 When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals with fish on it and some bread.

707
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,260
 And Jesus had made them breakfast.

708
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 And they sit down and we're told that they begin to eat and they're hanging out and having

709
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,580
 breakfast.

710
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,900
 And then Jesus and Peter have a conversation.

711
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:15,180
 When they'd finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John," which is

712
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,980
 like your mom using your full name.

713
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
 You know it's a serious conversation.

714
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,300
 It's like David, James, Marvin, what are you doing?

715
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,300
 It's essentially what's going on.

716
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,060
 "Do you love me more than these?"

717
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
 People...

718
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,220
 There's speculation on, is he talking about the other disciples or the fish?

719
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,420
 My guess is the other disciples because I feel like he would be like, "You mean the

720
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
 fish?

721
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
 Of course."

722
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,900
 But either way, his answer is going to be the same.

723
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,580
 "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

724
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,260
 And he said, "Feed my lambs."

725
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,260
 Again, Jesus said, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

726
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,460
 And he answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

727
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,140
 And Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."

728
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,500
 The third time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

729
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,540
 And Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him a third time, "Do you love me?"

730
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,420
 And he said, "Lord, you know all things.

731
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,420
 You know that I love you."

732
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,360
 And he said, "Feed my sheep."

733
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
 What is Jesus doing?

734
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,820
 Is he trying to rub something in?

735
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:27,900
 Jesus is recreating and redefining the future that Peter will have.

736
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,500
 He's recreating the moment of Peter's betrayal.

737
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,340
 "What do I mean?"

738
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,580
 They're sitting around a charcoal fire.

739
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,340
 Do you know the only other time in the entire New Testament that the word charcoal fire

740
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,260
 is used?

741
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,140
 Two chapters earlier, when Peter is sitting around a charcoal fire where he denies three

742
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,940
 times Jesus.

743
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,100
 Now he's sitting around a charcoal fire two chapters later where three times he says,

744
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,660
 "Jesus, I love you.

745
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,660
 I love you.

746
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
 I love you."

747
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,420
 Jesus is communicating to Peter, "Despite the fact that you abandoned me, despite the

748
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,260
 fact that you failed me, despite the fact that you do not deserve to be used by me,

749
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,700
 I want you to feed my sheep.

750
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
 I want to use you."

751
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,820
 What does that even mean, "Feed my sheep"?

752
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,500
 Jesus uses the metaphor for the people or the flock of God as his sheep.

753
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,820
 "I want you to lead the church, Peter.

754
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
 You may think I'm done with you.

755
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
 You get off the boat.

756
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
 You're not fishing for fish.

757
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
 You're fishing for men.

758
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,500
 I'm not done with you.

759
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,760
 I welcome those who are a disgrace.

760
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,700
 I welcome those who do not deserve to be used by me.

761
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,340
 That's the only type of people that I use."

762
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,300
 God every time there's a movement of God any place, anywhere, anytime, it is God working

763
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,300
 in spite of people.

764
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,580
 No matter how faithful someone is, no matter how much they try and they are devoted to

765
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,180
 Jesus, it is always working in spite of people.

766
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,220
 He says, "Peter, this wasn't about you.

767
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,980
 You think that I'm done with you?

768
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,980
 I want you to build my church.

769
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,660
 I want you to feed my sheep.

770
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,180
 I'm a God who welcomes the disgraced.

771
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,780
 When you feel shame and guilt, like Peter, you have a choice.

772
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:09,660
 I will either let that drive me towards Jesus and the fact that, yes, I failed.

773
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
 I'm a sinner.

774
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,060
 That's why I need a Savior.

775
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,540
 I don't want to wallow in that."

776
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,580
 The Bible says that you reap what you sow, so it doesn't mean there won't be consequences

777
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,300
 for decisions that you make, but if you're wallowing in shame and guilt, you need to

778
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,940
 know God is not done with you.

779
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,500
 He calls on you and calls to you just like he called towards Peter.

780
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,260
 "I'm not done with you.

781
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
 I have a plan for your life.

782
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,500
 I have a purpose for your life."

783
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,380
 It's as though Peter puts on the glasses and he sees maybe for the first time.

784
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,420
 Scholars think that this was the moment everything changed for Peter, but he understood that

785
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,380
 God wasn't a God who like, "Our relationship is defined by how good you do.

786
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,340
 And if you mess up one too many times, I'm done."

787
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,740
 But the God who's there, he doesn't work like that.

788
00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:01,940
 In working in ministry, I know that the power of shame and guilt can be overwhelming.

789
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,820
 I am not the husband that I want to be.

790
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,980
 I'm not the father that I want to be.

791
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,580
 I've said before that I just went through region to work on anger and control and pride

792
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
 and lust.

793
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,740
 Anytime that I fail, I have the choice.

794
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,540
 I'm either going to allow the fact that, "Yes."

795
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,580
 Just because I'm in ministry doesn't mean I can't be a Christian, which is someone who

796
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,740
 says, "God, I need you to help.

797
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,740
 I need to take ground.

798
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,060
 I'm going to bring in God's people and just say, 'This is where I'm not being everything

799
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,140
 that I want to be, everything God calls me to be.

800
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,500
 And God, will you please take more ground in my heart?

801
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,980
 Will you help me?

802
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:43,340
 Because there's still a war and there's still sin inside of me."

803
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,460
 If that shame and guilt is telling you right now that you need to run, the God who's there

804
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,780
 wouldn't love you, couldn't do anything about it, or your carrying is too heavy, you can't

805
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,340
 tell anybody, that is a lie.

806
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:02,500
 God who's done with you, that is a lie.

807
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,820
 And it is too heavy for you to hold.

808
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,660
 And the God who's there is saying, "I'm not done with you, Peter.

809
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,620
 And I'm not done with you.

810
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,620
 I love you.

811
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,940
 And I will use you and your story, no matter how broken and dysfunctional it is, to be

812
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,820
 a testimony to the world around you.

813
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:26,060
 And you'll experience purpose and life and meaning and hope, or you can allow it to drive

814
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
 you to go fishing."

815
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:35,900
 Whether that's towards the arms of a relationship you shouldn't be in, back to pornography,

816
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,620
 back to alcohol, or back to who knows?

817
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:46,740
 But the God who's there is not done, and he welcomes the disgraced and meets them with

818
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,260
 grace.

819
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,540
 Like I said, there were three Ds, the desperate, the doubting, and the disgraced.

820
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,980
 The truth is, as Christians, we live in a world where there's another three D, like

821
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,140
 I said.

822
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,260
 It's that we live in lens.

823
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,000
 We are invited as a Christian, if you're a follower of Jesus, to live a life that sees

824
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,700
 everything in life through another three D lens.

825
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,700
 What do I mean?

826
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
 A third day lens.

827
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,700
 What is the third day?

828
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,300
 The third day was the day that Jesus rose from the grave.

829
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,380
 He was crucified on day one, day two, and then day three, he rose from the grave.

830
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,460
 And now when that happened, everything changed.

831
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,640
 If that happened, even if you're not a Christian, you need to know this is what we believe.

832
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,640
 Everything changed.

833
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,780
 When Jesus rose from the grave, everything in our world that was broken has begun to

834
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,660
 start working backwards, and God gave the seal and the promise that one day I'm going

835
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,620
 to heal everything.

836
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,540
 And you now, if you're a Christian, the lens that we see the world through, the way that

837
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,700
 we see the brokenness of pain and life and the way that we look through the lens in this

838
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,900
 world is through the lens of the resurrection.

839
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,340
 Jesus rose from the dead, and if that's true, that puts everything in perspective.

840
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,060
 Every pain that you feel all of a sudden because of Jesus rising for the grave and conquering

841
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,540
 death, you know that that pain is going away.

842
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,940
 It's got an expiration date.

843
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,280
 It will not be a part of the world to come.

844
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,800
 Every disappointment you face, every circumstance where you're like, just wish I was married

845
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,260
 by now.

846
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,300
 All of a sudden it pales in comparison because it's put into perspective.

847
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,620
 The fact that this life is a vapor, I'm going to be with God forever and ever and ever.

848
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,340
 All the questions that I ask all of a sudden get shrunk down.

849
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,620
 Like, you know, where am I supposed to work?

850
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,620
 Where am I supposed to marry?

851
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,900
 And what am I supposed to do with my life?

852
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,740
 All of those in light of the resurrection, if it's true, if Jesus came back alive and

853
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,260
 everything that he said is true, and if you believe in him and trust in him, you're going

854
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,260
 to live forever and rise again.

855
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,660
 All of those questions, it's not that they go away, they get dismissed.

856
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,460
 They just shrink in comparison to the ultimate question.

857
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,880
 All of life.

858
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,140
 It's like goes into focus and you see it and it goes from fuzzy to.

859
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,140
 I can see it all through the 3D lens, the third day lens, the resurrection lens, every

860
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,900
 message, you know, it's crazy.

861
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,420
 I'm laying in the plane, every message in the new Testament, you know what it has, you

862
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,420
 know what they talk about?

863
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
 What do I mean by that?

864
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,540
 Like every time there's a sermon or Peter and Paul, they go around and they're like,

865
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,540
 Hey, you got to tell you this message.

866
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,260
 Do you know what they don't say?

867
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,220
 Hey, you should turn the other cheek.

868
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,380
 And if they, um, you know, go a mile, if they got a mile, let me tell you this parable is

869
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,380
 a great one.

870
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,180
 Uh, they don't have any of that.

871
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,500
 They say, I saw a man die and we buried him in the ground.

872
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,340
 And then three days later he came back alive.

873
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,060
 And so you can do whatever you want to me and you could tell me, I can't believe that.

874
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,560
 Look, dude, I saw a dead guy.

875
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,620
 He went into the ground and he came back alive.

876
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,100
 Every message in the new Testament, every sermon, check it.

877
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,900
 Every one of them doesn't have at the epicenter.

878
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,540
 If somebody wants you to go a mile, go to, it says, Jesus rose from the grave.

879
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,920
 And if that's true, everything has changed.

880
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,920
 Everything has changed.

881
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:40,380
 And Peter saw in a moment, it was true and everything is changing your life, your world.

882
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,780
 If you see it and you as a Christian are called to see it, and I'm called to see it through

883
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,500
 the lens of the resurrection of Jesus, he came alive.

884
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
 And you know what that means?

885
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
 You will too.

886
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,700
 So now we're going to baptize like a handful of different people, 15, some people, and

887
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,220
 they've all said, Jesus is alive.

888
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,220
 He rose from the grave.

889
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,220
 I believe it.

890
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,220
 He changed the calendar.

891
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,860
 He changed the world and he changed my world and I believe it and I've experienced it.

892
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,540
 And if that's true, and that's the lens we get to see life through, even death comes

893
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,820
 into focus.

894
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:13,020
 The worst scenarios in life you can see with the perspective.

895
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:18,420
 But it's the only one that gives any hope and aligns anything with or any ability to

896
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,540
 see in the midst of the darkest things, a deeper, greater reality that our God is alive.

897
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,780
 He is King.

898
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,780
 He's good.

899
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,780
 He's made a way.

900
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,140
 Let me pray.

901
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:50,300
 Father, I thank you that you don't give up on those who are disgrace.

902
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,580
 You allow us to wrestle with doubts and you don't shun us or move away from us.

903
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:05,180
 You move towards us in a way that is almost incomprehensible.

904
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,580
 You move towards the desperate.

905
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,860
 And so I pray right now, God, for every person in this room who has never had a moment where

906
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,140
 they trusted you are the one.

907
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,940
 You're the one that their soul was made for.

908
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,060
 You're the one who made their soul.

909
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,860
 You're the one who died in their place.

910
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,300
 You're the one who offers and promises eternal life that they will just accept it by faith

911
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,700
 and receive the free gift.

912
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,620
 You died and you paid for their sin, and then you rose from the grave.

913
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,340
 And it was like the payment, the check cleared.

914
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,820
 I pray tonight that you would call and whisper their name right now all over the room, that

915
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,380
 you would be calling people by name.

916
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,820
 That's what you do.

917
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,100
 And their life would be changed and they would begin to walk as though they were raised to

918
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,060
 walk in newness of life.

919
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,180
 Thank you, God, that you don't give up on disgraces and broken sinners like me.

920
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,860
 And that you call us to walk in that newness of life with other people around us.

921
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,260
 We worship you now in song.

922
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,940
 Would you be honored with the words that we sing and just the way that we respond to your

923
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,940
 word?
