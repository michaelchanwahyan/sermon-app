1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:28,800
 - All right, well, hey, welcome everybody joining us online.

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,720
 We are kicking off a brand new series tonight.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
 That is right, therapy,

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,160
 where if there was ever a time our world needed therapy,

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,200
 we have arrived in it.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,360
 And we're gonna be taking week by week,

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,480
 going through therapy sessions, if you will,

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,280
 and walking through mental health, anxiety, depression,

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,440
 what it looks like to be healthy in this space.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,740
 This series was planned even before COVID ever arrived.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,200
 We planned this back in 2019,

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,040
 and just as God would have it, here we are.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,800
 And so we're gonna walk through what it looks like

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,040
 to address mental health from God's word.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,320
 Let me give you a unique experience of anxiety

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,480
 that happened to me once in my life.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,080
 It was moments or hours really after I had gotten married.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,200
 So the wedding went off without a hitch.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,400
 My wife, Callie, here's a picture of her.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
 She looked beautiful.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,040
 You know, the wedding went great.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,660
 The Shane's sang at it.

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,800
 JP, a close friend, did the wedding.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,480
 The reception was awesome.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,720
 It was just a great night and we got married.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,400
 And I woke up the next morning

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,360
 and I was flooded with an emotion I did not expect to have.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,840
 It was the emotion of anxiety.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 Now let me explain how I kind of got there.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,860
 My one contribution to the wedding

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,440
 and this whole process as the groom was the honeymoon.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,960
 In other words, as you would probably guess

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,960
 if you are a girl, typically the bride is the heavy lifter

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,280
 as it relates to invitations, decorations, all that stuff.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,980
 But my one responsibility was the honeymoon.

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,240
 So I was not gonna blow it.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
 I had a friend in my life at that time.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 Give me a piece of advice.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
 I'm not sure it's biblical advice, but he said,

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,080
 "Hey, look, son, there's two things

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,100
 "that you can't spend too much money on,

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,440
 "an engagement ring and a honeymoon."

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
 And although that is clearly not biblical

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
 and sounds like the advice Kim Kardashian

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,200
 or someone would give,

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
 it was advice that I took to heart.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
 And I was like, I'm going big.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,440
 As big as a seminary student working at a church could go.

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,380
 So I got as good of a ring as I could.

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,000
 And I researched like crazy.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,840
 We were gonna go to the best honeymoon spot possible.

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
 So I found this place.

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,720
 It was like a boutique, gourmet, all-inclusive,

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,840
 amazing resort that, you know,

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,680
 you had your own private butler, 1250 square foot rooms.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
 You had your own private pool.

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,960
 It was amazing.

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
 And I just broke the bank saying,

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,560
 "We're going all in on this thing together."

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
 And so finally the wedding came.

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,840
 And like I said, I woke up the next day

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,880
 and I was flooded with anxiety.

64
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
 Not because of who I had married

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,280
 or being worried over, you know, the decision I made.

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
 I was totally thankful and excited

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,780
 about being married to Kelly.

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,520
 I was anxious about the honeymoon.

69
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
 And not because I forgot to pay a bill

70
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
 or forgot something to do,

71
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,400
 because I was worried about one question.

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,620
 What are we gonna do for the next eight days?

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,560
 We were going for eight days to a very secluded

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,420
 60 room boutique.

75
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,520
 There wasn't a lot of nightlife.

76
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
 There wasn't any nightlife.

77
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,440
 And I'm a very active person, like an extra extrovert.

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,480
 I like to be on the go, don't rest well,

79
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
 not a fan of massages.

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,780
 So the idea of kind of laying around all the time

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,080
 with literally a guy on the beach

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,940
 that would like play a harp

83
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,360
 and you sit in your bed all day.

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
 It was terrifying to me.

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
 And I began to like throw through this plate,

86
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,280
 like, what are we gonna do?

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,700
 I'm gonna be stuck completely excluded from society.

88
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,020
 I barely even know this woman.

89
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,280
 We've been married for 12 hours

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,260
 and we're gonna be tiredly cut off from everything.

91
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,440
 What am I gonna do?

92
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,920
 Thankfully, I had included a buffer day

93
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,840
 after our marriage or after we got married on Saturday night,

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,280
 a buffer day that would allow us to, you know,

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,780
 kind of relax before leaving

96
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,120
 for the honeymoon on Monday morning.

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
 Pro tip, I really recommend a buffer day.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
 It's just my thing.

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
 So anyways, on that buffer day,

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,760
 as I'm hit with anxiety, I'm like, man,

101
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,400
 I need to figure out what we're gonna do.

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
 So I begin to think through and reach for,

103
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 well, maybe we could do this, do this.

104
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,040
 I go to Barnes and Noble.

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,700
 I buy, no joke, 12 books.

106
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,800
 I don't know what I was thinking.

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
 It definitely increased the weight of my luggage

108
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,680
 that I was carrying on.

109
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,500
 Maybe I was thinking,

110
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,300
 I'll just make this an educational trip or something.

111
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
 That didn't calm my anxiety.

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,880
 So then I called AT&T.

113
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,160
 I was like, I need the biggest data international

114
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
 'cause we were going international,

115
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,160
 international package that you have.

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
 I'm gonna be cut off.

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,080
 I better have service

118
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,840
 so that I at least have access to the outside world.

119
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,020
 That didn't calm my anxiety.

120
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,480
 So I just began to download every movie that I could

121
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,520
 on my computer, on her computer,

122
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,960
 thinking if nothing else,

123
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,760
 I guess we'll just catch up on movies we haven't seen,

124
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,000
 like "Gone With The Wind" and "Forever" or whatever movie.

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,240
 And we'll just make this, have a backup of time.

126
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,980
 None of that calmed my anxiety.

127
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,380
 At some point I like broke down in tears to my wife,

128
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,360
 which it sounds ridiculous 'cause it is ridiculous.

129
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
 Well, I'm like sitting there

130
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
 having a borderline closest thing to a panic attack

131
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
 I've ever had going,

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
 "I just don't know what we're gonna do

133
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,560
 for the next eight days."

134
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 And crying in front of her,

135
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,240
 which had to make her really feel excited

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,940
 that her new husband is now crying

137
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,520
 about spending eight days with her

138
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,560
 in a foreign destination and only her.

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
 And like, part of me was like,

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
 I wonder, you know, could I bring a buddy,

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,240
 like my groomsmen or something?

142
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,840
 And it just was crazy and irrational.

143
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,980
 But in that moment, I did what anxiety does.

144
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,120
 It makes us reach for anything that can give us relief.

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,160
 Oftentimes because anxiety makes us irrational.

146
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
 It makes us reach for irrational things

147
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,880
 or things that often don't help our anxiety

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,560
 in the midst of feeling overwhelmed or anxious.

149
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
 People can turn to different vices

150
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
 or turn to pornography, turn to alcohol,

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
 or turn to marijuana.

152
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
 We just turn to a codependent relationship.

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,940
 Anything that will give us relief.

154
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,640
 And sadly, relief is seldomly experienced.

155
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,540
 But God loves you.

156
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,920
 And he talks a lot about anxiety.

157
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 And for the next few weeks,

158
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,300
 we're gonna spend more than one message

159
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,760
 or session in this therapy series on anxiety

160
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,340
 before we jump into another topic,

161
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,680
 because it's such a big issue in our culture.

162
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,040
 And there's not enough that we could do

163
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,880
 to cover it in one single night.

164
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,560
 If you've ever felt anxiety, you are normal.

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,400
 And you are right in line.

166
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,520
 If you've never felt anxiety,

167
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
 you do not live on planet earth.

168
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,240
 And I'm not sure how you're listening to this right now,

169
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,280
 because for the rest of us,

170
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
 at some point we experience fear, anxiousness, anxiety.

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,960
 The American Psychological Association

172
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,720
 has said that America is the most anxious country

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
 on the planet.

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,440
 There was a gold medal given out for most anxious.

175
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,240
 We would win it year after year.

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,480
 60%, according to the American Psychiatric Association,

177
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
 found that two in three, sorry, young adult,

178
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,200
 or two in three Americans were anxious

179
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,260
 or extremely anxious.

180
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,520
 That means most of us.

181
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
 In fact, millennials or young adults

182
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,420
 and generation right behind them, Gen Z,

183
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,320
 70% of young adults between the ages of 18 to 34

184
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,200
 describe themselves as anxious and increasingly anxious.

185
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,640
 And these were taken before COVID ever happened.

186
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,200
 Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication

187
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,400
 in the last 15 years have quadrupled in our country.

188
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,120
 Anxiety seems to really be getting worse.

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,880
 There's a study done that found that the average child today

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,560
 exhibits the same level of anxiety

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,960
 as the average psychiatric patient in the 1950s.

192
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,160
 This is not a problem, anxiety that's going away.

193
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,560
 It seems to, if anything, be getting worse.

194
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,480
 Much of which people think is probably

195
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
 because of the rapid change.

196
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,240
 Like we live in a world where everything's

197
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
 constantly changing and we're being bombarded

198
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,760
 all around us with how the world

199
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,480
 is constantly in turmoil.

200
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,740
 One study found that in the last 30 years,

201
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,840
 culture has changed as much as the previous 300 combined.

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
 And change can be stressful, anxiety producing.

203
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
 And if that wasn't enough,

204
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,160
 then you have the young adult years.

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,740
 And the reason why this, I think it makes sense,

206
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,400
 why this time in our life would be

207
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,520
 even more anxiety producing is because it's a time

208
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,280
 where you're making so many of the major decisions

209
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,160
 that you're gonna make in life.

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,120
 One study found that 80% of the major decisions

211
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
 you're gonna make are made between the ages of 18 to 35.

212
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,920
 Who you're gonna marry, the career path you're gonna be on,

213
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,500
 where you're gonna live,

214
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 shaping the person you're gonna be.

215
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,600
 And those are huge decisions.

216
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,660
 There's not a clear playbook on yes, I'm supposed to

217
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,780
 or not marry her, what am I supposed to do?

218
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,600
 We have God's word, but it's not always black and white on,

219
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,080
 should I work here, take this job or this job?

220
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,440
 So of course anxiety is gonna spike.

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,620
 But what if we're Christians, it doesn't have to.

222
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,360
 And our heart in this series is for us to look at God's word

223
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,080
 and give practical truths,

224
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,680
 practical things that we can reach for

225
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
 in those moments of anxiety

226
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,120
 that are not an international data plan or books

227
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,260
 at Barnes and Noble, but things that actually will help us.

228
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,960
 'Cause here's what I know.

229
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,020
 All of us have experienced anxiety.

230
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,380
 You will experience anxious feelings,

231
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,500
 but I also know that no one wants to.

232
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,660
 No one is like, hey God, you can have everything in my life

233
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,020
 and I'm keeping this for me.

234
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,380
 I'm not giving up my anxiety or my anxious feelings.

235
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,240
 Like I wanna hold onto this as long as I can.

236
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,900
 Nobody wants that.

237
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,100
 All of us, if we could push a button,

238
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,880
 we would hit it and say, God, take this from me.

239
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,620
 The good news is God doesn't want you to carry that.

240
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,460
 And throughout scripture,

241
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
 as we'll see in the next few weeks,

242
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,780
 he's given clear instructions on how you and I

243
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,060
 can begin to experience relief from anxiety.

244
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,900
 Tragically, I think the church has failed

245
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,700
 as it relates to mental health in a lot of ways.

246
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,060
 Failed as it relates to anxiety.

247
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,020
 And it's an issue that if someone struggles with it

248
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,940
 too often, our response is to go,

249
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,980
 hey man, you have struggled with depression or with anxiety.

250
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,140
 You need to go to a counselor or psychiatrist.

251
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,140
 You need to go get help from therapists.

252
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,500
 As though God's word, the Bible,

253
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,540
 and God's people don't have anything to offer.

254
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,660
 My wife is a counselor.

255
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,940
 She's a licensed professional counselor.

256
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,260
 I've talked about that before.

257
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,420
 Absolutely believe in what she does and love it.

258
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,300
 But even she would say,

259
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,320
 and any Christian counselor or counselor

260
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,140
 who's a Christian worth their salt or worth their weight

261
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,100
 or knows what they're talking about,

262
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,980
 would say for a Christian,

263
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,940
 God's word should always be the first line of defense.

264
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,100
 And beyond that, you never outgrow it.

265
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,700
 It should be the thing that we turn to first and foremost.

266
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,540
 And I think more than often,

267
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,820
 Christians don't because either they're told,

268
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,340
 they're pushed in a direction

269
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,420
 of go find help somewhere else,

270
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,220
 or they don't understand what the Bible teaches.

271
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,700
 I don't think a lot of pastors really break down

272
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,880
 and teach well what the Bible teaches on anxiety.

273
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,460
 So you may have heard something like this.

274
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,440
 And the Bible says, hey, don't be anxious, just stop.

275
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,780
 Or don't be anxious, just pray.

276
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,020
 All of which, you know, neither of which are bad things,

277
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,840
 but they don't work.

278
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,980
 And that's not what the Bible teaches.

279
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,900
 Here's what's true.

280
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,780
 If you could just stop being anxious,

281
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,680
 you would have already.

282
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,520
 All of us would.

283
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,780
 The good news is the Bible is way more practical,

284
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,700
 way more helpful.

285
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,940
 And it's one more transformative principles

286
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,360
 and truths in it.

287
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
 That if you and I apply them,

288
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,780
 they're just that, they're transforming in our life.

289
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,120
 We're gonna look at one of them tonight.

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,620
 We're gonna talk about the idea of recognizing your anxiety.

291
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,540
 Recognizing, because before you can do anything

292
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,580
 to address it, you have to recognize it.

293
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,900
 So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter six,

294
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,420
 we're gonna walk through three steps

295
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,740
 that are the first steps for you to experience peace

296
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
 or move down the path of peace.

297
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,580
 And it involves recognizing your anxiety.

298
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,020
 The first step is recognize

299
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,540
 what you're really anxious about.

300
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,740
 Second being recognize what it is rooted in.

301
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,260
 I'll explain and unpack all those.

302
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,820
 And then recognize what God says about those roots.

303
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,680
 I already said this, we'll be in Matthew chapter six.

304
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,900
 Matthew six is right in the middle of Jesus' sermon

305
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,980
 on the Mount, which was a sermon that was written

306
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,020
 and called Sermon on the Mount.

307
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,860
 Anybody know?

308
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,060
 You guys gotta start reading your Bible people.

309
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,580
 This is my staff team, they didn't even know.

310
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,780
 Because Jesus taught it from a mountainside.

311
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,680
 And he launches into a conversation

312
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,380
 about lots and lots of topics.

313
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,980
 He brings up, you know, anger and wrath and lust

314
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,900
 and how to handle relationships.

315
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,180
 And in the middle of it, he brings up anxiety.

316
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,340
 As though people have been anxious for a long time.

317
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,100
 As long as there was people, there was anxiety and worry.

318
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,460
 And Jesus launches into a conversation

319
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,860
 and says some tremendously helpful

320
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,900
 and really profound things that counseling

321
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,140
 and psychology today is catching up with.

322
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,340
 Here's what he says, Matthew chapter six, verse 25.

323
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,220
 I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,

324
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,280
 what you will eat or what you will drink

325
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,860
 or about your body, what you will put on.

326
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,720
 Let me hit pause.

327
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,400
 The word anxious, just quickly,

328
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,500
 is a word that means to meditate

329
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,580
 or dwell on anxious or fearful thoughts.

330
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,300
 In other words, it's not Jesus saying,

331
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,260
 hey, don't be anxious.

332
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,340
 He's not saying, hey, never have an anxious thought.

333
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,660
 That's impossible.

334
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,940
 If you thought that's what the Bible teaches,

335
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,180
 it's not what he's saying.

336
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,780
 The word is the word marim now.

337
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,340
 It's a word that means meditate.

338
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,020
 In other literature, it's used as meditation.

339
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,780
 When Jesus says, hey, don't meditate

340
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
 or don't make a practice in your life

341
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,660
 meditating on fearful and anxious thoughts.

342
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,120
 Who would disagree with that?

343
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,780
 Like if you're quick to dismiss,

344
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,140
 like, oh, Jesus just said, don't be anxious.

345
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,740
 No, he said, don't meditate

346
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,300
 on anxious and fearful thoughts.

347
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,860
 Who in the world would disagree with that?

348
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,500
 Who would be like, no, that's crazy.

349
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,620
 He would tell me to do that.

350
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,200
 I love meditating on anxious thoughts.

351
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
 That's what changed my life.

352
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,500
 Started getting up every morning.

353
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,180
 I spend the first 15 minutes meditating

354
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,400
 on everything negative, fearful, and anxious that I can

355
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,340
 that could possibly happen that day.

356
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,880
 And ever since then, I've been a new man.

357
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,820
 No, that's insane.

358
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,660
 Jesus is saying what all of us know.

359
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
 It's not a good use of time or your life

360
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,760
 to spend time meditating on fearful and anxious thoughts

361
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,260
 about what you will eat and what you will drink.

362
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,860
 Now he addresses what his audience is worried about.

363
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,820
 To us, he would say, hey, don't spend time meditating

364
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,980
 on how much longer you're gonna be single.

365
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,420
 Don't spend time meditating on focus on like,

366
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
 what if I never ended up getting married?

367
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,460
 Or what if I never have kids?

368
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,340
 Or what if I don't get the job

369
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,780
 and maybe in my room, it's gonna move out.

370
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,940
 And what if I ended up getting Corona?

371
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,700
 And what, don't spend time meditating

372
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,060
 and focusing on those things.

373
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,140
 They're gonna pop in your head.

374
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,420
 But you have a decision whether or not

375
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,740
 you're gonna choose to grab on and dwell on them.

376
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,100
 And he says, don't do that.

377
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,580
 And he addresses their worries.

378
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,980
 To us, he would bring up whatever you're anxious about.

379
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,140
 Your parents' relationship not working out.

380
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,580
 How much is in your bank account

381
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,560
 and whether or not you're gonna have enough.

382
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,580
 Whether you're on track to retire at the age you want.

383
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,940
 Whether the relationship is gonna work out.

384
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,300
 He's not saying don't care.

385
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,660
 He's not saying don't be responsible.

386
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
 Do both of those.

387
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,480
 But he's saying you don't have to focus

388
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
 and meditate and dwell.

389
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,880
 And he's saying, don't do that.

390
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,720
 And then he asked a question that I think is so profound.

391
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,080
 Isn't life more than food?

392
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,900
 And the body more than clothing?

393
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,640
 Again, he brings up their worries.

394
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,920
 As he would say, isn't life more than getting married?

395
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,940
 Isn't life more than having that new job?

396
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,320
 Isn't life more than getting a pay raise?

397
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
 Isn't life more than driving the right car?

398
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,520
 Isn't life more than owning a home?

399
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,480
 Isn't life, whatever you're worried about.

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
 It's not that those things are unimportant,

401
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,960
 but it's a really brilliant question.

402
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
 Let me ask you a question.

403
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,360
 Why do you think Jesus asks that question?

404
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,640
 Like, he's sitting there in front of an audience.

405
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,520
 He says, hey, you're spending so much time

406
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
 dwelling and focusing on whether or not

407
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
 you have enough to eat or whether or not

408
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
 you may run out of clothes.

409
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,420
 What you're spending your life on.

410
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,180
 Isn't life so much more than those things?

411
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,120
 Do you think Jesus is really looking for an answer?

412
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
 Like, is he like, guys, I don't know.

413
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,480
 Is that all life is about?

414
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,800
 No.

415
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,180
 It's safe to assume he's Jesus, which means he's God,

416
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,080
 so he knows the answer.

417
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,920
 It's a brilliant question,

418
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,740
 'cause what does that question do?

419
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,080
 It forces his audience to put into perspective

420
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,020
 the object of their anxiety, their worry.

421
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,160
 Because the answer it leads to is,

422
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
 well, no, I mean, life is more than food.

423
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,840
 In other words, like, no one here would say

424
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,040
 that all that life is about is making sure

425
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
 you got enough food, as long as you have enough grain

426
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
 for the rest of your life.

427
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,240
 That's the epitome of a great life.

428
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,920
 No one would say that.

429
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,820
 It's an important part of life, but it doesn't equal life.

430
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,560
 Just like for us, we'd go, yeah, I mean,

431
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,440
 no, marriage doesn't equal life.

432
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
 It's an important part, and it would be a great part,

433
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,120
 but no, it's possible to live a good life

434
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,040
 and not be married like Jesus did or like Paul did.

435
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
 It forces, when you think about it,

436
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,560
 it puts into perspective, like,

437
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
 you guys are spending all of your life

438
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,860
 focused on what are we gonna eat?

439
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,960
 What are we gonna eat?

440
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
 Where am I gonna work?

441
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
 Where am I gonna work?

442
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,520
 And you're actually giving your life away

443
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,120
 for something that's draining, sucking,

444
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,000
 and choking the life out of you.

445
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
 The word worry or anxiety in English

446
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,920
 comes from a German word that means to choke out.

447
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,680
 And Jesus' point is like, don't spend and focus your life

448
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,200
 or give your life focused on worrying

449
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
 or dwelling on negative thoughts.

450
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,960
 It's his attempt to help them better recognize,

451
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,600
 that's our word, recognize your anxiety,

452
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,760
 to see it more clearly than it is.

453
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,360
 'Cause here's what happens when we get worried or anxious,

454
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,840
 it becomes really hard to see anything

455
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,780
 other than the thing I'm anxious about.

456
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,400
 I leave a presentation at work,

457
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,360
 I leave wondering what does my boss think about me?

458
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,480
 And I begin to think of like,

459
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,800
 oh, I bet they didn't like me at all.

460
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
 I bet I'm gonna get fired from my job.

461
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,300
 I better update my LinkedIn profile picture.

462
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,860
 I never know what my LinkedIn password is.

463
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,700
 Where am I gonna?

464
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,520
 It begins to be like, all I can think about is that.

465
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
 And Jesus is just trying to pull his audience back,

466
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,100
 see more clearly.

467
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
 The mind is a funny thing,

468
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,340
 especially as it relates to anxiety.

469
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,040
 It like quickly can take something really small

470
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
 and blow it up really big.

471
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,500
 I was told, I read recently that a single glass of water

472
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 is enough to create a dense fog that's a hundred feet tall

473
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,860
 in seven city blocks wide.

474
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
 If you're in New York City,

475
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,820
 if you've ever been to a big city and you got seven blocks,

476
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,360
 you know, you're on the grid system,

477
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,900
 seven blocks long, a hundred feet tall,

478
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,740
 one glass of water stretched into millions and millions

479
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,640
 and millions and millions of droplets.

480
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,900
 It's really a picture of what fear

481
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,380
 and what our mind can do with fearful and anxious thoughts.

482
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,500
 Once a thought comes into the fog machine of fear,

483
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,020
 it gets stretched and pulled and pulled

484
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,860
 in every different direction.

485
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,080
 And so all of a sudden it's like, man,

486
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,380
 we had a really bad date.

487
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,340
 I thought this relationship was gonna go somewhere.

488
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,600
 That enters into the fog machine of fear.

489
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,940
 And I begin to go, oh my gosh,

490
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,100
 I'm gonna end up breaking up with him.

491
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,600
 He's probably the last chance I got.

492
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720
 I got no one else after him.

493
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 I'm gonna be the single cat lady for the rest of my life.

494
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,200
 And all of a sudden this interaction that you had

495
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,640
 as you were leaving a date becomes,

496
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,200
 I'm gonna be alone forever and ever.

497
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,220
 Your roommate's moving out

498
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,840
 and it enters into the fog machine of fear.

499
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,880
 And all of a sudden the thought goes from,

500
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,400
 what am I gonna do once my roommate moves out

501
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,880
 to be able to afford rent?

502
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,040
 'Cause I'm splitting it now.

503
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,460
 How am I gonna afford?

504
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,720
 That thought enters the fog machine of fear in our minds.

505
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
 And it comes to, oh my gosh,

506
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,280
 I'm not gonna be able to live here.

507
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
 If I don't find somebody,

508
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,600
 I'm gonna end up getting kicked to the curb

509
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,780
 'cause I can't afford my lease.

510
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,280
 I need to find somebody to live with.

511
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,020
 I don't know anyone who needs a place to live right now.

512
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,760
 Maybe I could look on Facebook or post something

513
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
 or post something on Craigslist.

514
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,880
 That feels like a recipe for having a psychotic person

515
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,340
 move in and murder me in my sleep.

516
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,860
 My options are being murdered in my sleep or be homeless.

517
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,080
 And all of a sudden this, what am I gonna do?

518
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,440
 Enters in and gets stretched and stretched and stretched.

519
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,800
 But listen, listen, listen.

520
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,380
 What if it doesn't have to?

521
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,340
 What if it was possible in that moment

522
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,740
 to see your fear more clearly?

523
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,880
 To see it not as this huge fog, but as a glass of water?

524
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,700
 Jesus's attempt with his audience here is to do just that.

525
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,900
 To help them recognize, why are you anxious?

526
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,100
 It's really behind that.

527
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,180
 Because once you get it down to a glass of water,

528
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,220
 it's still there.

529
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,420
 You still have to find a roommate.

530
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,620
 You still may have had a date that didn't end

531
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,620
 as well as you wanted to,

532
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,380
 but it's a lot easier to deal with

533
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,480
 and to deflate some of the power that it has on it.

534
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,660
 Jesus did what counselors today, like I said earlier,

535
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
 my wife is a counselor.

536
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,720
 And if you go see her,

537
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,660
 she would do, or many counselors do something similar

538
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,980
 where they try to ask questions

539
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,220
 with the goal of deflating the power of your worry.

540
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,660
 If you express like, I'm anxious about this,

541
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,900
 they'll ask you questions

542
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,860
 and help you try to recognize more and more

543
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,620
 and see more clearly about,

544
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,540
 or see more clearly the thing that you're anxious about.

545
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,380
 And I'll explain what I mean,

546
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,900
 but I'm about to give you $120 an hour worth of counseling

547
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,860
 right now for free.

548
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,100
 So if you just tuned in, it's at least worth your time

549
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,500
 'cause you're about to get what it would take $120

550
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,580
 or cost you 120 bucks for free right now.

551
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,540
 Let's say you went in and you were anxious

552
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,980
 'cause there's a lot of layoffs going on right now

553
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,820
 with COVID and with business and with all of that.

554
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,900
 And you went to see a counselor

555
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,860
 'cause you were anxious about losing your job.

556
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,300
 And you sat down with that counselor and you were like,

557
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,340
 man, I'm anxious about whether or not

558
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,900
 I'm gonna be able to keep my job or I may get laid off.

559
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,700
 There's layoffs coming.

560
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,500
 The counselor would sit down and she'd say, or he'd say,

561
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,740
 what happens if you get laid off?

562
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,620
 And you begin to go, well, I wouldn't be able to afford rent

563
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,980
 and I'd have to move out of where I'm living

564
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,500
 and I probably would have to move back in with my parents.

565
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,860
 And they'd respond with,

566
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,580
 what happens if you have to move back in with your parents?

567
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,420
 Well, then I'd feel like a total failure.

568
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,220
 And I would, everyone's gonna be like,

569
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,540
 I'm the guy who failed in life

570
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,540
 and I moved back in with my parents and I'm 28 years old.

571
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,180
 And all of a sudden my life, like I'm just a failure.

572
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,460
 You know, it's funny.

573
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,180
 And that made up storyline that I just gave there,

574
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,260
 he goes in and he thinks I'm anxious about losing my job.

575
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,340
 He's really anxious about being seen as a failure

576
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,180
 or he's really anxious

577
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,940
 about what other people think about him.

578
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,980
 In order for him to address and face or fight his anxiety,

579
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,620
 he's gotta be able to face what he's actually anxious about.

580
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,180
 In other words, he's anxious over what others think.

581
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,740
 If he's gonna chase down and experience freedom from that,

582
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,060
 he's got to be able to see what am I actually anxious about?

583
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
 The first idea from this, from this text,

584
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
 as I already said, was recognizing

585
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,000
 what am I anxious about really?

586
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,740
 Jesus over and over throughout the gospels

587
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,460
 asks a really funny questions to his disciples.

588
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,000
 On multiple occasions, there's like scary stuff going on.

589
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
 They're on a boat in Matthew chapter eight.

590
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,740
 And we're told that, I mean,

591
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,100
 these are all professional fishermen, Jesus's disciples,

592
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,020
 or most of them were like, they've been on a boat.

593
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,620
 They get it, they've been in rocky waters.

594
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,820
 And we're told this storm that was crazy.

595
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,920
 It was like an earthquake, the text says,

596
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,260
 on the water was out there.

597
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,340
 And Jesus is asleep in the middle of the boat on a pillow.

598
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,180
 That's what we're told in the verses.

599
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,020
 And they're over there

600
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,340
 and all the disciples are panicking, freaking out.

601
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,500
 And they wake up Jesus and they're like,

602
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,020
 Jesus, we're all gonna die.

603
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,860
 And he wakes up, wipes the sleep out of his eyes

604
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,740
 and says, peace, be still.

605
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,580
 And he tells the wind and waves and water to stop

606
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,580
 like he's talking to a toddler and everything stops.

607
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,940
 Then he asks a really interesting question.

608
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,860
 He looks at his guys, says, why are you afraid?

609
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,180
 Jesus, you're God, so you know everything anyways.

610
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,140
 Why would you ask a question like that?

611
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,780
 That's like, hey, there's an earthquake happening

612
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,580
 and stuff tumbling all around us and we're all terrified.

613
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,600
 And all of a sudden it stops and you come up

614
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,220
 and you're like, why were you afraid?

615
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,620
 Because I'm in an earthquake

616
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,020
 and things are falling all around.

617
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,900
 What do you, that's an insensitive, dumb question.

618
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,340
 Why are you even asking that?

619
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,860
 Jesus was helping his disciples see,

620
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,620
 what are you afraid of?

621
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,860
 My guess is they would say of dying.

622
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,360
 Why are you afraid of dying?

623
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,260
 I've already told you, you're gonna be with me forever

624
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,600
 and ever and ever.

625
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,940
 You know that I'm in control of everything,

626
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,900
 including the wind and the waves

627
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,580
 and every day that you live.

628
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,120
 Why are you afraid?

629
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,220
 The same question you've got to chase down.

630
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,920
 If you experience anxiety every time,

631
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,460
 there's something beneath the surface.

632
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,080
 So you got to know, why am I afraid?

633
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,120
 What am I anxious about really?

634
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,300
 And maybe a really helpful exercise would be

635
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,200
 for you to sit down and go,

636
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,340
 I'm anxious about because blank.

637
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,720
 I'm anxious about because blank.

638
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,060
 I'm anxious to talk at my workplace

639
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,180
 because I'm afraid of what my boss will think.

640
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,540
 Because I'm afraid my idea might not be great.

641
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,580
 I'm anxious about getting married

642
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,460
 because I'm afraid I'm gonna get divorced like my parents.

643
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,240
 I'm anxious about being single the rest of my life

644
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,300
 because I'm afraid I'm gonna die alone.

645
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,500
 In order for you to address any of those anxieties,

646
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 and we're gonna talk about how to address them,

647
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
 you at first have to recognize

648
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,060
 and be willing to accept them.

649
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,220
 You cannot address what you won't accept.

650
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
 And too many Christians try to pretend

651
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,780
 like I'm not anxious about something.

652
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,060
 Often because other Christians tell them,

653
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,300
 like you need to stop being anxious

654
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,720
 and stop worrying about things, which is not helpful.

655
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,900
 They would stop if they could.

656
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,560
 And telling them stop doesn't help them.

657
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,060
 No one has ever told me the story of like,

658
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,580
 you know what fixed my anxiety?

659
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,540
 Shame.

660
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,100
 I just had people around me saying,

661
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,580
 you should be ashamed of yourself for being, no.

662
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,980
 People would tell them like, you should stop being anxious.

663
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,220
 That just makes them more anxious

664
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,940
 about the fact they're anxious.

665
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,580
 So here's what I want you, I want you to accept.

666
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,640
 You may have never heard somebody ever tell you that before.

667
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,440
 Accept your anxiety so that you can address it.

668
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,000
 Hiding it or pretending it's not there

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,380
 is not more spiritual.

670
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,620
 It's living in denial, denial.

671
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,120
 What are you anxious about?

672
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,860
 Really?

673
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,540
 Step two, so once you know now the roots of your anxiety,

674
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,740
 that involves saying, I'm gonna address

675
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,220
 what's underneath those.

676
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,540
 Anxiousness, fear, and worry, they're all emotions.

677
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,940
 So every time I experienced the emotion of worry

678
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,180
 or anxiety, it's an emotion.

679
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,540
 Here's what you gotta know about emotions.

680
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,340
 This is gonna be thinking cap on,

681
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,700
 and we're gonna move through quickly

682
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,460
 the root of your anxiety, like what's underneath it?

683
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,100
 'Cause you can't fix it if you don't address the roots.

684
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,780
 Emotion or anxiety is an emotion.

685
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,060
 Every emotion you experience

686
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
 involves the intersection of two things.

687
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,380
 It involves something you believe

688
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,440
 intersecting with something you value.

689
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,940
 You cannot experience emotion,

690
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,260
 and you cannot experience anxiety,

691
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,180
 'cause anxiety's an emotion,

692
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,420
 without it involving something I believe

693
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,060
 about something I value.

694
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
 You can't experience freedom from anxiety

695
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,900
 without addressing something you believe

696
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,180
 intersecting with something you value,

697
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,780
 'cause it's an emotion.

698
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,940
 Let me explain, 'cause you're probably like,

699
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,780
 what, is it really?

700
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,480
 Let me think of an example.

701
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,420
 Every time you feel anxiety,

702
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
 there's something you value, it's place.

703
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
 So when I go outside today, when I get home,

704
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,420
 or tonight, or tomorrow,

705
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,300
 if I see a squirrel running in the street,

706
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,420
 I feel nothing, I'm not anxious, I don't feel anything.

707
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,260
 Even if I wanted to feel anxious, I wouldn't feel anxiety.

708
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,340
 I would feel like, oh, it's a squirrel,

709
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,620
 that's what they do, it's kind of their thing.

710
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,060
 They run back and forth, they look for acorns,

711
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,780
 or whatever they're doing, I would feel nothing.

712
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,220
 If I see a child that I value way more than a squirrel

713
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,500
 running in the street, I'm gonna feel fear, concern.

714
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,820
 I'm gonna run towards him, say, get out of the street.

715
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,900
 Could be a car coming.

716
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,180
 When I see my child, something of incredible value to me,

717
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,900
 something I value, running in the street,

718
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,260
 I feel tremendous fear.

719
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,940
 It's gonna move me out of that emotion to act,

720
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,020
 to yell, to run, and pull them out of the street,

721
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,820
 because I feel something I value is being threatened.

722
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,340
 It also involves a belief.

723
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,780
 What do I mean by that?

724
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,500
 I mean, if I see my wife with our kids,

725
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,340
 they're out in the front yard,

726
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,380
 they're walking through the lawn,

727
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,300
 and you know, on our grass,

728
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,040
 and she's walking towards what I believe is a snake,

729
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,900
 and I see it from afar,

730
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,140
 and I see what I believe is a snake

731
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,740
 intersecting with someone I value, my wife,

732
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,980
 I'm going to feel anxiety and yell,

733
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,460
 don't go closer, that's a snake,

734
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,980
 because something I value is intersecting

735
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,980
 about something I believe it could be, or it is a snake.

736
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,900
 Here's what's really interesting,

737
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,860
 this really profoundly helpful as it relates to anxiety.

738
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,500
 Whether or not it is a snake doesn't matter.

739
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,180
 If I believe it is, or I believe it could be,

740
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,060
 I'll feel anxiety.

741
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,660
 It's not about what's true, whether it is a snake or not,

742
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,800
 it's about what I believe, or what I believe could be true.

743
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,900
 So if you're gonna conquer,

744
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,140
 if you want to experience freedom from anxiety,

745
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,420
 if you want to take steps in the direction of peace,

746
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,680
 you're gonna have to address,

747
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 what am I believing, and what am I valuing underneath this?

748
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,260
 Like what is informing this?

749
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,220
 And if you do, you will begin to experience freedom,

750
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,620
 or more peace, every time you feel anxiety,

751
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,460
 that's underneath there.

752
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,700
 Here, and here's further why this is important.

753
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,300
 You're what you believe and what you value,

754
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,780
 even if you've been walking with Jesus for a long time,

755
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,900
 we're all a byproduct of the world environment,

756
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,040
 the family we grew up in.

757
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,540
 Like we were shaped, we didn't even know,

758
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,900
 like none of us woke up today and was like,

759
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,140
 you know what, I believe some things,

760
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,660
 and I think I value some things.

761
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,780
 They were formed our entire life.

762
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,540
 You were raised in a family,

763
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,860
 where they never told you,

764
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,100
 believe money is the most important thing, son.

765
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
 But you heard phrases like,

766
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,620
 son, the most important thing you can do

767
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,820
 is get a good job that's stable,

768
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,280
 to be able to put food on the table.

769
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,100
 And you heard most important thing I can do.

770
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,980
 And somewhere along the line, you began to go like,

771
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,780
 that is the most important thing I can do.

772
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,500
 And now if your job is threatened,

773
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,180
 or money is threatened,

774
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,820
 because you some point picked up,

775
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,700
 and it began to impact the way you think,

776
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,940
 what you believe, you feel anxiety,

777
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,140
 because you were shaped by parents,

778
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,220
 or by people, by friends who said,

779
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,120
 hey, this is the most important thing.

780
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,900
 And now you're anxious if it's threatened.

781
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,940
 So two people can be in the same exact circumstance,

782
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,180
 and one be anxious and one not,

783
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,740
 'cause they have different beliefs, different values.

784
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,700
 Some of you were raised in a home where,

785
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,300
 you know, you were taught,

786
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,940
 conflict is a really bad thing.

787
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,980
 You know, you don't fight, you never have conflict.

788
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,720
 Or your parents always hid it from you.

789
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,620
 Or you're raised in a home where they fought all the time.

790
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,060
 They fought in a way that wasn't healthy,

791
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,500
 and it really scarred you.

792
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,900
 And now today, anytime you're in a dating relationship,

793
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,420
 and you start having conflict, you get really anxious,

794
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,180
 and you wanna leave the dating relationship,

795
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,780
 because you believe that conflict is a bad thing.

796
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,780
 That's not what the Bible teaches.

797
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,220
 It says conflict can be a good thing.

798
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,780
 It's a chance to honor God, and it's a chance

799
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,860
 to grow closer, but you picked up at some point,

800
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,140
 without even knowing it, conflict is a bad thing.

801
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,500
 So now you feel anxiety.

802
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,760
 If you don't wanna feel anxiety

803
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,580
 when you have conflict in a relationship,

804
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,020
 you won't just stop.

805
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,540
 You won't just, I won't anymore.

806
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,420
 You gotta address, oh, I feel anxiety,

807
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,220
 'cause I believe conflict is a bad thing.

808
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,300
 You have to address the roots that are underneath those,

809
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,240
 if you want to experience freedom from anxiety.

810
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,640
 So quick recap, to remove anxious thoughts,

811
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,460
 we have to recognize what am I anxious about, really?

812
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,660
 What am I anxious about?

813
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,780
 And then I have to recognize what are the roots,

814
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,100
 like what are the beliefs?

815
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,700
 What am I believing and valuing?

816
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,100
 I'm anxious about getting married,

817
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,940
 'cause I wanna have kids, 'cause I don't think

818
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,100
 life is worth living if I don't have kids.

819
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,680
 Is that true?

820
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,540
 It's what you believe, but it may not be true.

821
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,080
 It's not true.

822
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,720
 Life is not worth living if you can't have kids.

823
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,100
 Jesus' life was not worth living.

824
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,700
 The Apostle Paul's life was not worth living.

825
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,640
 That's ridiculous.

826
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,780
 But somewhere in there, you may believe that.

827
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,260
 And so you gotta address, where am I believing a lie?

828
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,500
 How do I know if it's a lie?

829
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
 It gives us step three.

830
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,980
 You recognize what God says about those roots.

831
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,540
 I take all those beliefs, I take,

832
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,540
 I don't know that life is worth living if I don't have kids.

833
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
 What would the Bible say about that?

834
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,540
 And I take the Bible and I begin to put it up and go,

835
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,300
 oh, it says kids are a blessing from the Lord,

836
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,340
 but they're not the source of life.

837
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,420
 They're not even what life is about.

838
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,660
 You can have the abundant life and never have kids.

839
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,760
 Wow, I bought a lie.

840
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,960
 It says that money's not the source of security God is.

841
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,380
 So now when my job is threatened,

842
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,860
 I don't have to experience anxiety,

843
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,000
 or if I'm concerned about money,

844
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,180
 I'm not gonna experience anxiety

845
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,200
 because I am applying what the Bible says,

846
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,100
 which is God is the source of security and provision,

847
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,940
 not money.

848
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,620
 That's the truth.

849
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,500
 You may not believe it, which is why when not,

850
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,300
 when your bank account goes up and down,

851
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,500
 you begin to get worried

852
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,780
 'cause you don't believe God

853
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,220
 is the ultimate source of provision,

854
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,500
 but that's the truth.

855
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,340
 And if you wanna experience freedom

856
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,780
 from that anxiety you feel,

857
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,380
 you gotta go at those beliefs

858
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,200
 with the truth from God's word,

859
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,700
 or you can just keep worrying.

860
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,860
 In Hebrews chapter four, verse 12,

861
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,020
 we're about to land the plane.

862
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,240
 It says the word of God, the Bible even says,

863
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,580
 hey, I was designed, God's word was designed

864
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,340
 to help you cut the roots of your anxious feelings,

865
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,460
 to get at them and give you freedom from them.

866
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,540
 It says the word of God is sharper

867
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,820
 than any double-edged sword.

868
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,620
 It pierces through even dividing the soul

869
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,260
 from spirit and joints from marrow.

870
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,500
 How cool does that sound?

871
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,580
 Braveheart.

872
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,600
 It's able to discern, listen to this,

873
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,540
 it is able to sift through or discern

874
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,420
 or judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.

875
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,080
 The desires, that's the things you value.

876
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,080
 And the thoughts, that's the beliefs of your heart.

877
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
 It's able to go through and go, hey, this is actually a lie.

878
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,920
 That's not actually true.

879
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,740
 Conflict's not a bad thing.

880
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,320
 Hey, what other people think about you?

881
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,080
 It shouldn't own you and it shouldn't wreck you

882
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,520
 'cause you should be living according to the Bible

883
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,920
 in Galatians one, for God and an audience of him.

884
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,800
 And other people, whether they think good about you or bad,

885
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,620
 it shouldn't wreck your life.

886
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,500
 And God ultimately controls even what people think about you

887
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,000
 and you begin to take all those truths.

888
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,500
 And all of a sudden, instead of anxiety, when I'm leaving,

889
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,900
 I'm going, my job isn't the source of security in my life.

890
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,480
 God is, he owns everything there is.

891
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,140
 He could give me a million dollars tomorrow

892
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
 if he wanted to, or he could just give me,

893
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,380
 whatever a million could lead to.

894
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,100
 He's a source of provision in my life

895
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,740
 because I'm attacking whatever lies are underneath there.

896
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,220
 And every time I experience anxiety right now,

897
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,140
 if you feel it this week,

898
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,760
 it tells you something you value,

899
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,500
 you believe is possibly threatened.

900
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,280
 And now I take all of that and I begin to go,

901
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,460
 what would God say about this?

902
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,300
 How does God's word inform this?

903
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,920
 That's why we're so big on community group.

904
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,840
 That's why we're big on like you being equipped

905
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
 'cause it takes work to know what does the Bible say?

906
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,060
 Go to watermark.org/equipping.

907
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,160
 If you're interested in knowing, like, man,

908
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,980
 I wanna know my Bible better to be able to do this better.

909
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 Ultimately, it's like this.

910
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,660
 I hope you walk away from this message

911
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,020
 'cause it's just a starter.

912
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,540
 When I go to the mall, I hate going to the mall,

913
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,940
 by the way, who likes going to the mall here?

914
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,500
 I bet you like going to the mall.

915
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,860
 You like going to the mall?

916
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,100
 You love going to the mall.

917
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,540
 Yeah, you do.

918
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,980
 No, Josiah, you love, yo.

919
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,780
 I hate going to the mall.

920
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
 Here's one of the reasons why.

921
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,500
 I don't know, I get this feeling every time I walk in there,

922
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,020
 it's like I can't breathe.

923
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,900
 It's like the walls are closing in.

924
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,140
 It's like a weird Vegas meets clothing everywhere.

925
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,620
 There's no windows anywhere

926
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,900
 and I don't know where I'm going

927
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,380
 and I go up one escalator

928
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,300
 and it just takes me to a top of another place

929
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,100
 and I just like, I don't feel comfortable.

930
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,540
 It's probably like control issues

931
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,740
 where I don't know exactly where I am right now

932
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,100
 and if I can avoid it, I avoid it

933
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,060
 and I don't wanna brag.

934
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,780
 It's been pretty successful in being able to avoid it

935
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,580
 and that I do all of my shopping online.

936
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,660
 I don't go to the mall.

937
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,540
 I never go to the mall.

938
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,380
 I can't tell you the last time

939
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,260
 I even went shopping at the mall

940
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,620
 with one exception, the Apple store.

941
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,020
 Every year at some point, inevitably,

942
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,980
 my screen on my phone will crack or something will happen

943
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,180
 and I'm so ingrained in my life with Apple

944
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,020
 that I have to end up going to the store

945
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,340
 'cause you can't just send it in.

946
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,420
 I have to go to the mall

947
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,620
 and I do the same thing every time.

948
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,460
 I never know where to park,

949
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,420
 so I call my wife, ask where do I park.

950
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,380
 If I can't get her on the phone,

951
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,060
 I'm like, well, I'll just roll the dice again

952
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,900
 and I end up parking the entirely opposite direction

953
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,500
 of wherever the Apple store is

954
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,580
 and I get out of the car and I go in there

955
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,140
 and try to figure out where do I go now

956
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,660
 and I go up to me and your grandma.

957
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,220
 Go to the last physical map in society,

958
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
 that little kiosk thing and it has a whole map

959
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,340
 and double layers and you're like,

960
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
 oh, where am I right now?

961
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,140
 Glasses on and I try to figure out where am I

962
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,860
 and every time I look at that map, I do two things.

963
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,700
 I look, where is the Apple store and where am I?

964
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,020
 You know that little star that says you're here?

965
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,660
 I look, where's the Apple store and where am I?

966
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,820
 Because it's not just important of, oh, Apple store.

967
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,760
 That is of no value unless I know, oh, me.

968
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,520
 If I don't know where I am,

969
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,660
 I cannot get to where I want to be.

970
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,240
 This is how it is in terms of anxiety.

971
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,880
 If you don't recognize where you are,

972
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,180
 I'm anxious about this.

973
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,420
 I'm anxious about whether or not

974
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,540
 I'm gonna have a job next year.

975
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,620
 I'm anxious about whether or not

976
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,180
 I'm gonna be afforded to continue to save.

977
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,200
 I'm anxious about whether or not

978
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,660
 this relationship's gonna work out.

979
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,000
 If you're unwilling to say, this is where I am.

980
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,920
 I'm right here, I wanna go right here.

981
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,420
 You're never gonna get to where you wanna go.

982
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,120
 You're never gonna move in the direction of peace

983
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,020
 in that illustration because you won't accept where you are.

984
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,280
 And this entire first message is just,

985
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,220
 you've gotta recognize, why am I anxious?

986
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,660
 Recognize, what are the roots below that anxiety?

987
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,540
 And then recognize, what would God's word say about that?

988
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,420
 If you wanna experience freedom,

989
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,460
 that is not gonna end it.

990
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,820
 It's not gonna make every anxious feeling

991
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,220
 you ever have go away, but it will help you take a step

992
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,940
 because you can't get to where you wanna go

993
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,180
 if you won't accept where you are.

994
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,580
 And God's word in that map illustration,

995
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,580
 it's like God's word becomes the guiding line of,

996
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,760
 oh, this is what I need to do.

997
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,100
 It helps me understand how far off I am

998
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,420
 and how do I get to a place of peace?

999
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,100
 And it takes day by day by day,

1000
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,180
 which is why at the end of this passage,

1001
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,060
 Jesus says, it's gonna take one day at a time,

1002
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,940
 one day at a time.

1003
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,460
 Therefore, don't be anxious about tomorrow.

1004
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,760
 It's got enough to worry about.

1005
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
 You focus on today.

1006
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,740
 But first you gotta recognize, what am I anxious about?

1007
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,300
 Others of you, you need to recognize,

1008
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,140
 and you're tuning in,

1009
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,640
 the biggest thing you need to walk away with is not,

1010
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,100
 hey, how do I get to where I wanna be in terms of peace?

1011
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,540
 You need to recognize that where you are

1012
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,380
 in relationship with God is you have been separated

1013
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,260
 and cut off because you've never accepted

1014
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,500
 what Jesus did on the cross, dying for you.

1015
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,140
 Why do I say you've been separated?

1016
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,420
 The Bible teaches, our life experience shows us

1017
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,500
 that anytime sin comes into a relationship,

1018
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,280
 like you've wronged somebody, it hurts the relationship.

1019
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,660
 All of us in our lives have sinned in a way

1020
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,780
 over and over and over that it's hurt our,

1021
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,200
 it's cut us off from a perfect, loving, holy God.

1022
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,820
 That's where you are on the map.

1023
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,580
 The good news is God sent his son into the world

1024
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,340
 so that you wouldn't have to be separated from him.

1025
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,540
 He could bring you home,

1026
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,220
 but the only way that you could be reconnected or restored,

1027
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,160
 end up at the place you want to be,

1028
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,620
 is by putting your faith in what Jesus did

1029
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,660
 on the cross for you, for me.

1030
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,460
 He died for everything you ever did, and he paid for it.

1031
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,540
 And what you need to walk away is not,

1032
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,140
 how do I not be anxious?

1033
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,820
 But how can I have eternal life?

1034
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,580
 'Cause you're gonna keep being anxious in this life,

1035
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,120
 'cause the biggest thing that you should worry about

1036
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,900
 is no one, or you are the person who's paying for your sins,

1037
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,400
 and you don't have enough in the bank to pay for 'em.

1038
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,660
 God already paid more than enough,

1039
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,460
 and he's invited you, trust in me,

1040
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,020
 and you'll experience peace in this life

1041
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,380
 and for all of eternity, as you walk with me,

1042
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,460
 and eventually for all of eternity.

1043
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,780
 If that's where you are, tonight is your night,

1044
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,620
 and by faith, you can just say,

1045
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,460
 "God, I'm a sinner, I trust you.

1046
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,760
 "I want your help, I want you to do therapy in my life,

1047
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,460
 "and I want you to restore me to a relationship with you."

1048
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,300
 Let me pray.

1049
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,500
 Father, I pray for every person listening right now,

1050
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,240
 anxiety is such a huge part of all of our lives at times,

1051
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,180
 and many of us right now.

1052
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,540
 Would you pierce through our fear?

1053
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,160
 Help us see you through the midst of all of it.

1054
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,500
 Help us to be willing to accept, I'm anxious about this,

1055
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,500
 and then help us to be diligent and earnest to address,

1056
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,920
 what does God's word say about this?

1057
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
 Am I maybe believing a lie?

1058
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,000
 I'm afraid of losing something that you say is important,

1059
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,400
 but it's not all that life is about.

1060
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,440
 Would you help me?

1061
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,320
 Would you help my friends?

1062
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,520
 Would you be more real than the fear right now?

1063
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,720
 We love you, thank you for Jesus,

1064
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,560
 who's made a way for all of us to get

1065
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,840
 back to a relationship with you forever.

1066
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,480
 The one who wants us to experience peace,

1067
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,200
 the one called the Prince of Peace.

1068
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,840
 Would we walk with him and experience that now, amen.
