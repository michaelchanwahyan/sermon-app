[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.640]   - What's up, Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.920]   So good to be with you, great to worship with you guys.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.420]   Welcome, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.920]   people around the world tuning in via podcast or stream.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440]   We're so glad you are with us,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.060]   gathering with us in your communities
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.800]   and with your friends and neighbors and whatnot.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.160]   So great to be here.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's going to be a fun night
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920]   of just diving into the scriptures.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   Recently, I told you the last few weeks
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.560]   that my family and I just got back from vacation.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.460]   We went with a couple families with kids and whatnot.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.260]   And one of them was Shaney who leads worships
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.120]   here most nights.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.760]   And he had these walkie talkies.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.840]   So we went to the beach
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.640]   and he brought these walkie talkies with him.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.040]   And I just thought that was a great idea
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100]   because when you're like, our kids were in run room
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.720]   and we were in another one.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.840]   And so you kind of got just like, hey, what do you do
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840]   if somebody wakes up in the middle of night or something?
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960]   And I just thought the walkie talkies were a great idea.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.600]   And so I went home, got on Amazon Prime, made it happen,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   got some walkie talkies.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.920]   And so there's these, I saw specifically these kind
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.480]   that had a 24 mile range, 24 mile range.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.780]   I'm like, this is gonna be amazing.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840]   'Cause I've got a three year old son, Weston,
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   and we can just like have fun.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.160]   Like I'll be at work, Weston, you know, 10-4, are you there?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.120]   Anybody got their ears on?
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.280]   Kind of thing, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.620]   And so, I'm thinking about all of the possibilities
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.460]   with these walkie talkies.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.600]   My other buddy, he lives a couple miles away.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.120]   He has a three year old son too.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.380]   I'm like, hey, they're gonna be buddies.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.820]   You know, like the old school,
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.680]   remember like the tin can with the string?
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.640]   Well, now in 2016, it's walkie talkies.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.440]   And so, they're gonna be able to talk and you know,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   just have fun, it's gonna be great.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.840]   And so these walkie talkies come in,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.920]   and I'm thinking like, I'm gonna be at work,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.800]   like sitting at my desk.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.720]   Hey, Weston, you there?
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.400]   And so I did that, it didn't work.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.760]   And so I go home, I get the box, I'm looking at it,
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.540]   and I see there's three pictures.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.540]   The first picture are two boats on the ocean, open ocean.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.640]   And it says 24 mile range, like two boats, unobstructed.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.480]   The next picture are two people in a forest.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   There's trees, and it says one mile range.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   And then the next picture are people in the city,
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.600]   and like buildings and walls and whatnot,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960]   and it's like one block range.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   And I'm like, oh, burn, man, false advertising.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.760]   What's up with that?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   And as I think about that,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.440]   and where we're headed this evening,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.640]   I think about just like all of the noise
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.080]   and the distractions and all the things
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   that want to come between us and Christ in 2016.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.000]   The emails and the text messages and the social media
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.280]   and the relationships and the news and the killings
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   and the craziness and the chaos,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.960]   and yet we're supposed to sit still with Christ,
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   but there's all of these things, all of this noise,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.900]   all of these structures that wanna come between us.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.180]   And so the closer, the closer we must be,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   the closer we must be to him
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.120]   so that we can commune with him and talk with him
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   and have a relationship with him,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.240]   because in those three pictures, we're all the third one.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   We are all in the city, if you will.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   We are all the people separated by lots of noise
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.360]   and structure and chaos.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   And so we're moving through a series called AD.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.440]   AD stands for Anno Domini,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.560]   which is Latin for the year of the Lord.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.000]   It started as the year of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   shortened to the year of the Lord,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.840]   you have BC before Christ, AD,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   that 2016 years ago, God became a man
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.560]   in the form of Jesus Christ,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.760]   and the calendar started counting from zero,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.240]   that every atheist you know acknowledges Jesus
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.160]   by the date they put on their checks.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.840]   How crazy is this?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.160]   And so we gather tonight here at the porch in his name,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.640]   and this evening, we're talking about
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.240]   distractions from Jesus,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.360]   what pulls you away from time with Jesus.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.260]   And for me, I'll just tell you, it's technology.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.780]   Like, it's my iPhone, it's the noise of emails,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.160]   it's the clutter of the chaos that continues to creep in
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.640]   and fight for my attention.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.200]   There always seems like there is so much other things
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.660]   that I can be doing that studying the scriptures
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.480]   and sitting with Christ just seems impractical.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.780]   It rarely seems like the smartest option, the best option.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.120]   We need this text this evening, porch.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.880]   I'd love for you to do something right now, if you would.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.160]   I'd love for every single person in the room
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.960]   to pull out their phone and hold it up high.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.400]   Like, grab your phone, your device, your smartphone,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.480]   your walkie-talkie if you brought one,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.560]   and hold it up in the air.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840]   I see you, I see you.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.960]   Hold it up high, hold it up.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   Here's what I, I didn't bring it, I put it away.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.440]   What I'd love for you to do,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.880]   here's what, what am I gonna ask you to do?
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.600]   I'm gonna ask you to turn it off.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   I want you to turn it, now here's what just happened,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.400]   here's what just happened.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.680]   You began to think about all the reasons you can't,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.600]   I gotta take notes on it.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.440]   What about my Bible?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.280]   What about my mom, she's gonna text me when she's here
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.120]   to pick me up.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.440]   All of these reasons that you,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.280]   what, my friends aren't here,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.400]   they're gonna tell 'em where I'm sitting.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.240]   What about the picture?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   What about the, what about social media?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.440]   You want me tweetin', right, JP?
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.920]   What about this hashtag?
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.000]   Turn it off.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.680]   Turn it off.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.080]   The world is gonna go on without you.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.520]   Hold that button, slide that finger across that screen,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.280]   and your excuse is not good enough.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.160]   Turn it off.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.000]   And here's why.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.520]   Houston, Fort Worth, I hope you held up your phone,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   I hope you're turning it off right now.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.840]   We gotta hear this message.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   I don't want anything to distract you
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.800]   from consuming the word of God this evening.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.200]   And so as we move through this text in Luke chapter 10,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.360]   I'm going to look at three questions.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.080]   Two are about distractions, and the last question
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.960]   is about what marks our lives.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   Is it distractions or devotion?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.240]   And so I'll tell you the story on the front
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080]   and picture this.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   Jesus approaches a town called Bethany.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.040]   It's one and a half miles east of Jerusalem
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.560]   as he moves towards the holy city, if you will,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.120]   and he's invited into Martha's home.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.040]   And so Martha is busy getting everything ready for dinner.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680]   She's making preparations, the scripture says,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.280]   and her sister Mary is sitting at Jesus' feet,
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.920]   which is a controversial move
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.980]   because this is a place of disciples,
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.800]   not something women would have done in this time,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   but Jesus receives her and he's teaching her,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.920]   and Martha comes to Mary and to Jesus and says,
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.440]   whines to Jesus, "Jesus, Lord, she's not helping.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.360]   "Will you ask her to help me?"
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.760]   She implores Jesus to come to her side,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.140]   and Jesus speaks up and gently rebukes her,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.320]   saying that your sister Mary has done the better thing.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.560]   Now, I don't know if you have siblings
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.680]   or have ever seen sibling rivalry,
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.860]   but this is crazy if a child comes and says,
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.960]   "Hey, Mommy, don't you understand?
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.120]   "Finley is," Presley, Finley's doing what is right.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.720]   Oh, it feels, ah.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.880]   There's a heaviness to that.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   There's a difficulty there.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.660]   And so I know this family
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.040]   because this is similar to my family.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.000]   There's three siblings.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.760]   There's Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.320]   This is classic birth order, if you will.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.480]   Martha, the oldest, is getting after it.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.120]   She's the rule follower,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.320]   and Mary likes to color outside the lines, if you will.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.400]   She's sitting at Christ's feet.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.960]   And so these are Jesus's friends.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.680]   They show up in the scripture three times.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   They show up here at this mealtime,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.920]   another time when Lazarus dies
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.720]   and Jesus brings him back to life,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.120]   and then another time when they're dining yet again,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.600]   and Mary anoints Jesus's feet
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   with the famous perfume, the alabaster jar.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.220]   And so we'll dive into that,
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.080]   but let me start here in Luke chapter 10, verse 38.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.520]   As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.040]   he came to a village
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.200]   where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.840]   She had a sister called Mary,
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.320]   who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.140]   And then it says this,
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.800]   "But Martha was distracted by all the preparations
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.720]   "that had to be made."
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.600]   And so while Mary's learning at Jesus's feet,
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.760]   it says that Martha is distracted by her to-do list,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.040]   all the things that she has to do.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640]   There's this dichotomy in the room.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.020]   There's Mary's and there's Martha's, okay?
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.080]   And you already know which one you are.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.940]   I don't need to heap further judgment on you.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.560]   You've already probably self-identified at this point,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.160]   or at least you've identified your roommate
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.980]   or what your mother is.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.080]   And so my first question tonight is,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.040]   what are the distractions that pull you away from Jesus?
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.100]   You need to know this.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.000]   What are the distractions today
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.280]   that pull you away from Jesus?
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.080]   We don't know exactly what Martha was distracted by,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.920]   but it wasn't sinful things.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.120]   Like she's not in the other room looking at porn.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.400]   She's not in the other room taking shots at Patron.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.480]   She's not getting wasted,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   getting thrown in the other room,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   hitting the bong, if you will.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.680]   Like she's doing something good.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.060]   She's doing something, what she perceives as righteous.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.540]   She's getting things ready
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.880]   for whoever's going to come over.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.120]   She's making standard preparations.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.880]   She's not on Instagram, #JesusIsInMyLivingRoom.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   No, she's not doing any of that.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.120]   Like she's getting after it.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.240]   She's doing good things.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   Good things can distract you from Christ.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.280]   And Jesus would prefer her to be with him
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.640]   rather than work for him.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   Are you more inclined to do things for Jesus, F-O-R,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.800]   or with Jesus?
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.860]   And here we see his preference for followers of Christ.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.960]   Those who profess to be Christians.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.760]   Christ shows his cards here in this text.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.300]   He says, "I'd rather you do things with me.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.000]   "I'd rather you sit with me."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.280]   This text has been beating me up
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.600]   for the last week and a half,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.100]   just thinking that we are not contemplative enough,
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.160]   that we are not still enough.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.400]   I am confident that Christ followers in 2016
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.520]   have not embraced enough the discipline
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.840]   of being still and listening to God.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.400]   Now, I don't know if you did that today.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.700]   I don't know if that was a part of your life,
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.280]   but I'm confident that it needs to be.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.760]   My hunch is that what Martha's doing here,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.040]   like what she's motivated by,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.720]   is kind of the approval of others.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.120]   It looks like service.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.320]   Hear me out, if you will.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.920]   It looks like she's doing good things.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.800]   It looks like she just wants to care for those around her
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   that her motive is caring,
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.880]   but in reality, I think,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.340]   as I studied this text for over a week now,
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.800]   I think it's actually more a concern
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.640]   of what others will think.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.720]   I want them to think that my house is clean,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.900]   that I have it in order,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.320]   and that I'm a good cook.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.700]   She's driven by, I believe,
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.640]   the approval of others,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.560]   and that has led her to be stressed out and anxious.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.000]   I'll tell you that no one is busier
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.840]   than someone trying to manage the perception of others.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.800]   No one is busier than someone
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.080]   trying to manage the perception of others.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.560]   If you want people to think you are important,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.400]   you're going to wear yourself out
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.360]   trying to manage that perception.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.520]   And so here is what I want to give you
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.840]   to help you overcome that.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.560]   A death grip on this reality, this truth right now.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.400]   God is in charge of what others think of you.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.680]   That right in the other room,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.540]   as Martha is getting after it,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.880]   the one who is sovereign over the opinions of everyone
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.120]   is sitting right there with her sister.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.880]   God is in charge of what your boss thinks of you,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.400]   what she thinks of you,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.960]   what he thinks of you,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.040]   what your friends think of you.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.160]   God is in charge.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   He's sovereign over the opinions of others.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.520]   This should set us free from this.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.160]   But Martha is distracted.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.800]   The etymology, the root of that,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.280]   or the origin of that word, distracted here,
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.120]   it means to be pulled away from.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.100]   So it's like you're headed towards something
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.820]   and you're pulled off track.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.120]   You're pulled away from it.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.440]   At the lake this weekend,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.880]   went to the lake with my family,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.480]   did the whole stand up paddle board thing,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.020]   which is quite humorous
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.200]   because I'm a lot of weight in just like one central area
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.320]   and I just don't do well with these stand up paddle boards.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.680]   Like wakeboard, skateboards, all good.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.980]   Stand up paddle boards, my just nemesis, if you will.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.620]   And so there I am trying to balance on this thing,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.240]   not doing well, keep falling off, I hate them.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.400]   And so there's this leash though
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.840]   that kind of keeps it close to you, which is helpful.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   But I noticed something that as I put the leash on,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.680]   this strap, if you will, there's Velcro there.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.640]   And so I put it on
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.040]   and it doesn't really hold together well
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.920]   because it's soggy and muddy
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.800]   and there's leaf particles in there
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.280]   and fuzzies and all this stuff.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.860]   And so like that the Velcro sticks together
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.560]   is kind of just a suggestion.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.040]   It's kind of like only the moisture of the water
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.880]   that's holding these two straps together.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   And as I thought about that and I looked at that,
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.040]   it's all the things in between the Velcro
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.820]   that's preventing it to stick together
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.200]   or to stay together as it should be.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.700]   And therefore it's easy to pull it away.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.920]   And I thought about our relationship with Christ
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.680]   that as we should stay clinging to him,
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.120]   that we should stay stuck to him,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.280]   maintaining a relationship with him,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.080]   maintaining communication with him,
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.320]   that there's all these things that have come between us
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.400]   making it easy for us to be pulled away
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   like Martha is here in this text.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.320]   And so I don't know what it is,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.260]   what are the preparations for you, for me,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.120]   I'll just show you, like here's a picture
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.220]   of this is my literal phone.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.360]   And so for me it's social media,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.400]   it's where I'm going,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.440]   it's entertainment,
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.000]   it's even the porch can pull me away
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.520]   like the things that I have to do,
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.040]   good things that are my responsibilities,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.400]   my work if you will.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.760]   Emails, that's right, 23,965 unread ones.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.920]   So if you're wondering why I haven't emailed you back,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.040]   there you go, you're not alone.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.840]   Messages, text messages,
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.020]   Twitter, and that's right, Craigslist.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.080]   Like as I think about, this is crazy,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.780]   true confessions, as I think about
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.200]   what has pulled me away from Christ most this past week,
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.220]   this is just me being vulnerable with you right now.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.280]   It's the fact that I want a golf cart.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.300]   And I catch myself, true story,
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.700]   I catch myself reading the Bible
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.580]   and finishing and going on Craigslist
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.460]   and looking at golf carts.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.980]   And there's like this excitement,
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.660]   this materialistic hole in my heart
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.400]   that is more excited about the thought or idea
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.680]   of buying a golf cart, I don't even golf.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.420]   True story, play golf I think I should say,
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.580]   I don't even play golf.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.740]   I'm more excited about that idea
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.020]   than sitting with God the creator of the heavens and the earth
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.020]   the one who literally died for my sins
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.940]   and rose from the dead
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.740]   and the one who I'm gonna spend eternity with.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.780]   What's wrong with me?
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.580]   Wretched man am I.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.900]   And so I don't know if you ever feel
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.500]   like you don't have enough time.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.740]   I've been saying something for years now,
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.960]   I don't intend to stop but it always makes people angry.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.360]   And you gotta hear me,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.720]   you will never have more time than you do right now.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   And I'll tell you I've married people off,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.780]   there are folks that have been in the porch
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.700]   that have four kids now.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.000]   And every single one of them have come back to me
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.760]   and said, JP man that was so true.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.000]   When you said I didn't believe it when you said it.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.880]   But man that was true.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.040]   Like quiet time just feels like a thing of the past.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.240]   Once when I could just go in my closet,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.600]   just get away from my roommate
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.320]   and I could spend time with Christ.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.380]   Now I have to geographically move locations.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.960]   I have to find a forest,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.200]   some place where my children can't find me
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.240]   so that I can sit quietly with Jesus.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.440]   That quiet thing, it is like this elusive unicorn
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.760]   that I've gotta find, okay.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.720]   It is very difficult to get that.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.400]   You will never in your life have more time
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.520]   than you do right now.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.720]   Period, done, fact.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.640]   Absolute truth.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.880]   And here's what that means.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.620]   You will probably at no time in the future
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.300]   spend more time with Jesus than you did today.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.900]   So I don't know what it looked like for you today.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.280]   But if you have some grand hope,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.160]   some grand scheme or plan that one day
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.440]   I'm gonna have four children, a German shepherd,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.320]   a white picket fence and a spouse in the suburbs
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.700]   and an hour quiet time every day.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.880]   But today I'm busy.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.080]   You are sadly mistaken.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.400]   You are fooling yourself.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.600]   You have believed a lie.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.340]   The enemy is at work.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.520]   And I just wanna set you straight.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:32.960]   And so Martha is distracted from spending time with Jesus.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.600]   And the reality of it is that she has the luxury of him,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.480]   the physical incarnate God, being right in the other room.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.040]   But so do you.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.600]   And Jesus is right in the other room waiting on you
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   in a quiet space saying, hey, come spend time with me.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.880]   Come sit at my feet.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.520]   How do you spend time with him?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.920]   That's the question.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.000]   How do you spend time with Jesus?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.400]   How do you connect with him?
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.000]   And all followers of Christ have to have a death grip
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.440]   on the answer to this question.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.580]   This should be a question that you can answer like,
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.920]   what color is the sky?
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   How tall am I?
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.580]   What's my name?
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.920]   What's my address?
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.080]   Speaking for yourself.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.800]   You should be able to answer this question,
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.040]   how do you spend time with Christ?
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.920]   How do you connect with him?
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.320]   As easy as those questions.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.580]   And you've gotta find out what it is for you.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.760]   For me, it's things like walking in nature,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.320]   walking, getting so lost in nature
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.560]   that it's gonna take me time to get back to my truck
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.440]   or technology of any kinds that I find myself
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.720]   in a place surrounded by leaves and streams
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.520]   and birds, if you will.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.320]   And I have to sit still and be with God.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.220]   For me, this is funny, don't picture it,
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.480]   but taking baths, okay?
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.920]   I know, I know.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.640]   Taking baths are a time where I can connect with God.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.880]   And lastly, something else that's kind of silly
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.600]   is faith-based films.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   I don't know why.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.640]   I mean, it's not for the acting,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.560]   but there's something about faith-based films
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.600]   that stir my affections for Christ.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.120]   I think what it is with all three of those things,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.920]   as I'm just honest with you,
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.000]   I think that I'm putting myself in situations
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.660]   that are difficult to get out of.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.800]   All three of those situations
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.700]   are situations away from technology, if you will.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.660]   You can't be in a movie just texting and checking email.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.240]   You can sit there.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.440]   I can be in nature, connecting with God,
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.400]   away from technology, and in a bathtub.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.440]   I don't wanna be electrocuted.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.020]   So therefore, all of those things
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.320]   are just places where I'm forced to be still.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.220]   What is it for you?
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.760]   You need to know what it is for you.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.680]   'Cause if I told you, I'm like,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.220]   "Here's what I want you to do today, all right?
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.800]   "I want you to take a walk through a forest,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.880]   "take a bath, and watch Fireproof,"
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.040]   you're gonna be like, "No.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.740]   "No, I should've went War Room, I guess."
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.140]   She came to him, this Martha, comes to Jesus and asks,
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.180]   "Lord, don't you care that my sister
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.720]   "has left me to do the work by myself?
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.440]   "Tell her to help me!"
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.800]   Martha, Martha.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   Whenever you see that, two names repeated,
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.440]   it happens throughout the scripture.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.800]   It's a term of endearment.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.120]   It's a term of deep, deep compassion.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.600]   It's not satirical here.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.440]   It's not satire or sarcasm.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.280]   He's moving toward her, and he shows deep compassion for her.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.060]   Martha, Martha, the Lord answered.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.920]   You're worried and upset about many things.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.080]   And so the second question that I see here in this text
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.480]   is what are the dangers of those distractions?
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.040]   Here in this little section, we see the outcome
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.240]   of the result of Martha's distractions.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.740]   What are the dangers of those distractions?
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.940]   Martha begins to blame others for her troubles.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.880]   This is what we do when we've been distracted from Christ,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   we're not abiding with Christ.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   We begin to look for excuses.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.320]   Well, of course he got the job, okay?
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.000]   The boss likes him, it's favoritism.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.640]   She's prettier than I am.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.560]   Of course that happened.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.000]   Another thing is if we're sitting there
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   and we're having a quiet time, if you will,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.100]   but we don't really wanna be, and other people are playing,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.640]   there can be like jealousy that raises up in our heart.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.040]   Why aren't they doing the work that I'm doing?
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.640]   And you begin to blame others.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.800]   The next thing that Martha does
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.320]   is she questions God's love for her.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.680]   Such a temptation when we neglect Jesus.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.920]   God, don't you care?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.880]   I talk to people all the time that are frustrated
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.480]   by the outcome of their lives when they're angry at God.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   And the reality of it is is they haven't,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.160]   God hasn't been a part of any of those decisions.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.980]   It wasn't like God told her to date the guy
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.100]   that was gonna break her heart.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.280]   Like God wasn't a part of that decision.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.520]   As I think about in my own life this week,
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   I know there's a lot of materialistic illustrations here
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.280]   just to give you a picture of the dark corners of my heart.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.560]   This week we had been contemplating or thinking about,
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.760]   considering a new car for my wife,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.600]   and there was one particular one that I was interested in,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   and I was thinking about it.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.900]   I met with community about it.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.020]   I even talked to pastors about it,
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.560]   asking others is this a good idea.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.000]   I asked others to pray about it.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.120]   Would you just pray for me?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.440]   And this decision was just sitting heavy on me.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.320]   And I almost had this like,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.620]   God, why don't you give me clarity?
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.320]   Like tell me what to do.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.220]   And then I woke up at like three in the morning one night,
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.720]   and I just heard you hadn't asked me.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.760]   And I realized it was just like this moment,
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.000]   like I hadn't even consulted with God about this decision.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.280]   I had asked others to,
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.480]   but I had been so distracted by the decision,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.000]   so distracted with processing all the data
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.440]   and the information that I hadn't even gone to God myself.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.600]   And so I'm like, Jesus, I'm sorry that I haven't asked you.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.200]   Should we get this car?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.680]   And immediately my heart, my mind goes to all
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.360]   of the materialistic reasons that I wanted to buy this car,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   the comforts and the perception and just the nice features.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.320]   And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.720]   I'm not gonna do that.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.860]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.960]   So others get frustrated by how work is going,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.760]   relationships are going, how family is going,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.840]   but they never really spend any amount of extended time
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.560]   with Christ asking him to change the circumstance.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.840]   I'm not talking about fly-by prayers while you're driving.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.080]   I'm talking about sitting still for extended time
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.480]   at the feet of Christ.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.800]   Another thing that Martha does here in her distractions,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   and this is a big one, she tells God what to do.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.840]   Such a different posturing than Mary sitting
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.240]   at the feet of Christ, that she's so distracted
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.120]   that she gets caught up in the self-centeredness.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.300]   Again, I believe wanting the approval of others
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.640]   that in a moment she thinks that she can tell God,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.560]   the one who formed her in her mother's womb, what to do.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.200]   She doesn't realize who Christ is.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.880]   She's ordering him around in this moment.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.520]   Tell her to stop.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.040]   God, give me the job.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.840]   You're gonna keep me single forever?
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.080]   What do you do?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.920]   You sleeping up there?
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.320]   Do you not see me down here?
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.120]   And maybe you don't say that out loud,
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.080]   but maybe that's the cry of your heart.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.280]   And it's time to sit still.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.340]   In the servant's position at the feet of the Lord Almighty.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.840]   Saying, I can't, but you can.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.440]   I can't, but you can.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.400]   See, there's this epidemic in our culture
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.740]   that's self-centeredness, some call it narcissism,
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.480]   that is leading to the greatest levels of depression
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.920]   the world has ever seen.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.800]   The highest levels of anxiety
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.920]   the world as we know it have ever seen.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.280]   And it starts with this idea
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.320]   that we think we control things.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.840]   We don't control things.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.640]   God controls things.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.400]   So you'd be better off spending time
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.700]   with the one who controls everything.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.480]   Martha's anxious, it says.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.760]   She's worried and anxious about many things.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.880]   This comes from thinking that she's in control.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.800]   It comes to a place of realizing,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.960]   I don't have what it takes.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.200]   And if you realize that you don't have what it takes
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.120]   and it drives you to a place of humility,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.160]   drives you to a place of a humble and contrite spirit.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.760]   God, I don't have what it takes, but you do.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.600]   That's a good thing.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.040]   But if it's like, I don't have what it takes
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.000]   and I'm still trying to manage it all, that's a bad thing.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   That's why we've said here,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.520]   if dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.720]   My friend Cheryl shared that with me years ago
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.800]   and it's just become a mantra of my life.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.360]   If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.200]   Tweet that out.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.140]   Oh wait, nevermind.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.560]   If dependence is the goal.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.760]   It's good.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.240]   It's good for my self-esteem, that guy.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.760]   If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.620]   There's this picture that has ministered to me this week
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.320]   of clinging to the Father,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.240]   clinging to someone.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.920]   At the lake this weekend, we did some wake surfing.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.760]   Have you done this?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.600]   It's fun.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.280]   And my son, my three-year-old, he like desperately,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.200]   I'm behind the boat, we're wake surfing,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.920]   and my three-year-old like desperately wants to do it.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   Daddy, let me on, Daddy.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.280]   He's just on the back of the boat, just chatting.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.480]   Let me do it, I wanna do it, I wanna do it.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.800]   He's three, you know.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.120]   And so finally, I'm like, all right,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   come in the water with me.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.400]   And I hold him and I'm like, hey, I want you to hug my neck.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   And then I'm in the water, I'm like drowning.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.960]   I'm like, okay, not that tight, not that tight.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.400]   And so he's just holding my neck and they pull me up
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   and I set him down on the surfboard.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.920]   And he is just, I mean, he's looking around
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.240]   and just clinging to my leg.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.180]   I have a picture.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.040]   This is Weston just clinging to his Daddy
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.560]   as tight as he can, smiling ear to ear,
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.420]   not gonna let you go.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.920]   There's nothing that's gonna separate me from you.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   And this is a picture of what I believe Christ wants from us.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.600]   Just this cling, this holding on to,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.120]   nothing's going to rip me, nothing's gonna come between us.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.280]   Nothing's gonna pull me away, distract me from you.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.360]   I'm gonna hold on right here.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.240]   If dependence is the goal, weakness is my advantage.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.840]   I don't have what it takes, you have what it takes.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.340]   I'm just gonna hold on to you.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.880]   We feel so counterintuitive when we're busy
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.400]   to sit still with Jesus.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.880]   I acknowledge that.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.240]   But it is completely necessary.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   We've never been busier as a culture,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.120]   but I don't know that God's gonna receive that excuse.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.800]   Get up there and you're like,
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.040]   how come we never spend time together?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.440]   Well, God, don't you know I was born,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.040]   you know, I lived in 2016.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.200]   It was the busiest culture we've ever had.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.440]   You knew that, right?
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.000]   I don't think that's gonna fly.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.400]   I've heard that busy is an acronym.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.560]   Being under Satan's yoke.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.640]   Being under Satan's yoke
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.200]   is what it means to be busy,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   that he uses that to distract us.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.880]   Martin Luther said, "I have so much to do today,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.340]   "I must spend the first four hours in prayer,"
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.840]   which is a picture of that, of how counterintuitive it is.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.520]   It's like, I have so much to do today
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.280]   that I must start by focusing my heart and my mind
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.440]   on the only one who can get it all done.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.960]   So blaming others and doubting God
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   and narcissism and anxiety,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.040]   they're all outcomes of being distracted
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.240]   from the main thing, verse 42.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.560]   But few things are needed, Jesus responds.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.500]   Actually, it's only one.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.280]   And Mary has chosen that.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.920]   She's chosen what is better.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.280]   And then he says this strange phrase,
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.960]   "And it will not be taken away from her."
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.640]   I've wrestled with for a week, what does that mean?
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.000]   And it will not be taken away from her.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.880]   I'm pretty excited about some of what I've found.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.760]   And so my third question this evening is,
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.280]   is your life marked by distraction or devotion?
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.800]   It's a dichotomy.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   Mary was known to this day for devotion.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.520]   Martha often memorialized to this day
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.680]   for her distraction.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.760]   What marks you, your life today?
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.960]   Do people, coworkers, friends, family, roommates,
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.320]   those that know you best say,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.760]   "Oh man, that is one devoted brother.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.300]   "She is very devoted to her faith, devoted to Christ."
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.880]   Or, no, she's kind of always stressed out,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.980]   distracted, pulled away, lots of different directions.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.880]   Mary is sitting at Jesus's feet.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.480]   This literally means she's being taught by him.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.280]   It's the same word that we see in Acts 22, verse three,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.840]   the same phrase where it says,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.240]   Paul's talking about himself.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.520]   I studied under Gamaliel, okay, the rabbi.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.080]   He's saying, it says in the Greek, the same phrase,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.760]   I sat at Gamaliel's feet.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.160]   Mary is sitting at Jesus's feet.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.540]   That is, she's studying under Jesus.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.320]   There has to be a part of our relationship with Christ
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.760]   that is spent studying him, knowing about him.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.120]   It's like when you're in love with someone
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.320]   and you want to know their favorite things,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.400]   what they like, what they like to do,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.120]   where they like to eat, her favorite flowers,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.720]   those sorts of things.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:01.440]   My girls are nine and seven,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.800]   and they have just started in the past year
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.360]   reading the Bible, and so prestly,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.840]   my nine-year-old will wake up,
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.200]   and before she does anything, she reads a chapter.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.920]   She wanted to get baptized, and I just said,
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.560]   hey, before you get baptized,
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.120]   I'd like you to read through the book of John.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.560]   So she's reading a chapter a day right now.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.240]   And so Finley, my seven-year-old,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.040]   has picked this up as well.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.640]   And so I'll just ask them afterwards,
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.000]   you know, what did you learn?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.280]   And my seven-year-old, who's probably a little young
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.720]   for the assignment, has just come back to me,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.320]   and I said, Finley, what did you learn?
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.200]   She said, I don't know.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.040]   Well, what did you read?
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.860]   I don't know.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.700]   Well, who were the characters?
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.840]   I don't know.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.880]   Baby girl, how do you not know?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.000]   And she just breaks down sobbing.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.080]   She says, Daddy, the Bible is so confusing.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.880]   The words are so big,
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   and I just don't understand what it's saying.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:55.200]   And my hunch is that some of us are 27,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.700]   and we feel the same way.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.440]   That we open it up, and it's not like,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.720]   like we're almost envious of our friends that are like,
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.920]   oh man, I just sat with Jesus today.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.520]   I got so much from him.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.520]   Man, it was amazing.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.700]   I was just like, me and Jesus, like having breakfast.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.540]   It was incredible.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.160]   He just told me all this stuff.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   It's awesome.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.480]   And you're just like, really?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.240]   From Leviticus?
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   Like, I mean.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:34.240]   And so my little girl's like, Daddy, I don't read well,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.780]   to which I say, what a gift.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.420]   I don't read well either, Finley.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.860]   Not very good at reading.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.640]   So you know what it means?
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.700]   I have to read slow.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.360]   I have to take it in.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.960]   I have to read it multiple times.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.540]   What a gift not to read well.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:56.080]   I have to spend extended time with Jesus.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.240]   I have to let the Spirit of God make known to me
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.800]   the things of God through the word of God,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.500]   so that I might be the man of God.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.960]   What a gift not to read well.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   And if you don't read well, consider that the gift it is
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.800]   to live in 2016, that we have podcasts and preachers.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.480]   We have books on tape.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.760]   We can have someone read the Bible to us.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.720]   We can watch it.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.080]   We can have it illustrated.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.600]   If you're an audible learner or a visual learner,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.240]   you can talk about it in community.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.640]   You can go line by line, what does this mean?
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.920]   You can be discipled, have others teach it to you.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.320]   You can enroll in a place where they literally
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.800]   will sit there and tell you what every single word
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.720]   means, and you have to know what makes you love Jesus more.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.760]   You have to.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   A part of your time with him has to be learning about him
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.360]   like any great relationship.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.440]   And I love, not to go on a tangent here,
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.400]   but I love that Jesus was not sexist.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.440]   That he believed that women were an extremely important
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.720]   part of the church, that he was a revolutionary.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.120]   He did what no one else would do, and he said,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.000]   "Come here, let me instruct you,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.880]   "'cause you, ma'am, have a role to play
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.680]   "in the work that I'm doing."
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.680]   But it's also, it's not just learning,
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   it's also a posturing of submission
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.480]   that Mary would sit at his feet.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.400]   She's acknowledging that he was Lord.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.320]   And this blew my mind, like get ready for this,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.360]   'cause this is really fun about this text
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.600]   and about this person.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.280]   Mary shows up in the scripture three times,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.000]   and you see two words over and over all three times.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.840]   You ready?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.560]   Mary and feet.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.840]   Mary and feet.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.600]   And I don't think she had a foot fetish, okay?
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.360]   I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.200]   I just wanna paint the picture
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.280]   that there's something else going on here,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.800]   that every time Mary shows up on the scene,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   she is at all three times Jesus' feet in John 11, 32,
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.240]   when Lazarus has died.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.840]   It says, "When Mary reached the place where Jesus was
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   "and saw him, she fell at his feet."
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:09.400]   And then, in another meal in John 12, verse three,
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.440]   it says, "Then Mary, same Mary,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.900]   "took a pint of pure nard," weird word,
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.480]   "and expensive perfume, an expensive perfume,
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.580]   "and she poured it on Jesus' feet
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.880]   "and wiped his feet with her hair,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.560]   "acknowledging him as God."
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.400]   And what Jesus says is, "She's preparing me for burial."
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.080]   Trivia question, who was the first person
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.800]   in Jesus' lifetime on earth
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.840]   who knew that he was going to die?
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.160]   It was Mary.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.040]   He says, "She's preparing me for burial."
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.200]   And everybody's like, "What are you talking?
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.280]   "That's not figurative.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.680]   "Oh, you're literally, what?
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.840]   "You're gonna die."
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.760]   Mary knew, why?
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.920]   She spent time with him, listening to him,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.480]   talking with him.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:10.340]   When you spend time with Jesus, you learn about him.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.600]   The Spirit of God makes known to you the things of God
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.120]   through the word of God so that you might be the man
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.440]   or woman of God.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.880]   I'll tell you, the only reason that a man or woman
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.400]   would read their Bible is because they believe
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.800]   they don't have it all figured out.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.120]   And that God, who's sovereign creator,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.320]   he knows better than they do.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.800]   And so it's a posturing of submission.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.840]   And the only reason that a man or a woman
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.880]   does not read the Bible is because they don't believe
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.520]   it's a worthwhile activity.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.840]   They believe that they have something better to do.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.480]   It's the only reason someone doesn't read the Scriptures.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.980]   And so what Mary learned from him,
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.700]   it says, will not be taken from her.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.340]   That Mary somehow in that moment invested in something
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.640]   that would last forever, which let's all agree
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.980]   that's a great investment.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   Diamonds are not forever, contrary to the popular ad.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.000]   But whatever you might do with Christ lasts forever here.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.240]   It will not be taken away from her.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.360]   And I just wanna show you something
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.960]   that is exciting to me, because when the disciples
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.680]   come to her and rebuke her because she breaks
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.040]   this expensive perfume on Jesus' feet,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.860]   it says this, when the disciples saw this,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.000]   they were indignant.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.500]   Why this waste, they asked.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.840]   This perfume could have been sold at a high price
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.720]   and the money given to the poor.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.000]   Aware of this, Jesus said to them,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.200]   why are you bothering this woman, Mary?
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.880]   She has done a beautiful thing to me.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.180]   The poor you will always have with you,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.960]   but you will not always have me
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.360]   when she poured this perfume on my body.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.080]   She did it to prepare me for burial.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.760]   Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.360]   throughout the world, what she has done
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.560]   will also be told in memory of her.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   And 2,000 years later, that prophecy is fulfilled tonight
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.320]   as we declare the gospel that Jesus Christ
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.360]   has died for your sins, that God has raised him
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   from the dead, and before he did,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.460]   there was a woman named Mary who anointed him for burial,
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.480]   and Christ said just before that at a meal,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.340]   what she has done will not be taken away from her.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:34.080]   That there is some profound reality
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.840]   that you can make an investment in eternity
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.320]   by the things that you've done in the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.640]   that is with Christ, and the things that you've learned
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.160]   from Christ by being with Christ
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.640]   will last forever and ever and ever.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.000]   First Timothy four, verse eight says this.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.100]   For physical training, can the gym be a distraction?
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.040]   Not for me.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.340]   For physical training,
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.520]   for physical training is of some value,
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.040]   but godliness has value for all things,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.100]   holding promise for both the present life
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.160]   and the life to come, and the life to come,
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.440]   and the life to come.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.120]   I've gotta leave you with this as we wrap up.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:37.360]   Life's a journey of learning what is important.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   Now I'm gonna say this, you're gonna agree with me,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.680]   I just, just hang in there with me,
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.600]   'cause I see this is so true in my children.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.400]   So true in my kids, that Weston, my three-year-old,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.240]   he has a night-night, it's a blankie.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.600]   And my girls had one too, but now that Finley's seven,
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.920]   she looks back and like, oh, Weston loves his blankie,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.520]   it's so cute, you know, it's silly.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.640]   I'm like, you did too.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.800]   She's like, no, I know what's important now,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.640]   I've got Kitty, she's got a stuffed animal named Kitty.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.340]   This is the stuff that's important, you know?
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.760]   And Presley, my nine-year-old's like, ah, she's so silly,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.880]   she's got her stuffed animal Kitty.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.760]   I'm like, Presley, you did too.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.200]   I've got these coloring books over here,
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.840]   this is where it's at, you know?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.520]   Arts and crafts, she's into, that's where she's at.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.960]   She finds life, and it just continues, right?
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.160]   You get to high school and it's like,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.520]   oh, now I know what's important.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.140]   I gotta make the team, get the letter jacket,
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.580]   I gotta get asked to prom,
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.720]   I gotta have these right relationships,
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.040]   this is what's important.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.440]   Kitties and coloring books and night-night, so silly,
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.600]   this is what's important.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.240]   And you get to college and you like, look back,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.160]   you're like, letter jacket, what was I thinking?
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.380]   Now I know what's important, right?
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.000]   Now I know, it's fraternities and sororities
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.780]   and getting the right professor and making the grade
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.880]   and getting a diploma from the right school.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.440]   Now I know what's important, silly me, letter jacket.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.720]   And then you get out of college and you're like,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.080]   what was I thinking, sorority, fraternity?
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.920]   What a waste, I've gotta get a good job.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.400]   I've gotta make good money.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.600]   I gotta somehow convince some human being
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.560]   to spend the rest of their life with me.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.600]   Now I know what is important, right?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.660]   And then you get there and I'm just gonna telegraph
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.360]   for you a little bit what's coming
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.280]   'cause you're gonna get there and be like,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.680]   what was I thinking, now I know what's important,
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.160]   I gotta have kids.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.420]   And then your kids grow up and you're like,
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.800]   now I gotta make sure my kids go to good schools
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.820]   and get good grades and get the right professors.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.460]   And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.480]   And here's what I'm telling you is one day,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.680]   you're gonna look back and I'm serious,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.320]   you gotta believe this, okay?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.760]   You gotta hear me 'cause this book doesn't lie.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.340]   One day you're gonna look back like,
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.800]   oh, the only things that were important
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.540]   were the things that last forever.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.960]   That's what was really important,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.080]   the times that lasted forever,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.920]   the investments in eternity, the times with Jesus.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.880]   I wasted so much time worried about letter jackets and jobs
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.280]   and so many other good things that are good things.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.880]   They're just not ultimate things.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.560]   And so there are many distractions
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.840]   that pull us away from Jesus,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.920]   like to-do lists and wanting the approval of others.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.180]   And these distractions have detrimental outcomes
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.140]   like blaming others and doubting God
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.480]   and narcissism and anxiety.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   And Christ, through his servant, Mary,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.280]   and his servant, Martha, is calling you to live a life
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.760]   in devotion to Jesus that's sitting with him,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.440]   fighting anything that is distracting you from him.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:53.200]   Last night, I had to go write this message,
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.800]   but before I did, I was talking to my girls.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.320]   I was laying in Presley's bed
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.720]   and she comes up and crawls on top of me
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.800]   and puts her head on my chest and looks up at me.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.220]   And she's like, "Daddy,
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.720]   "I feel like we don't go on dates anymore."
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.560]   I'm like, "Baby girl, we go on dates,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.520]   "we just went on a date last week."
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.720]   She's like, "I know, but before that,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.200]   "I just feel like it's been a long time."
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.840]   And I begin to defend myself.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.660]   I start telling them, I'm like,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.640]   "Well, sweetie, there's three of you now.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.100]   "We had more kids and they have to share time with Daddy.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.140]   "And plus, your mom is a priority to me.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.400]   "And so if I'm gonna have one date,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.720]   "it's gonna be with her."
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.600]   And I begin to talk, and then it dawns on me,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.000]   I'm like, "Wait a minute, just the week before last,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.080]   "I invited you on a date too.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.540]   "Remember, it was Awakened down in Clyde Warm Park
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.600]   "and I went to you and I said,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.840]   "Hey, I want you to come with me.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.640]   "I think it's gonna be a good time."
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.380]   And she was like, "Yeah, but Daddy, we were watching a movie.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.560]   "Finley and I were watching a movie
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.160]   "and we were gonna have fun."
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.640]   And Daddy, that just didn't sound very fun.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.440]   More church, you know?
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.800]   And I said, "Oh."
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.820]   I said, "Baby girl, I don't know
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.400]   "that you want time with me.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.700]   "I think you're chasing experiences.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.600]   "Like you're just looking for outlets to have fun.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.460]   "You don't really want time with me."
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.700]   And as I think about us and I think about this generation,
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.440]   I really resonate with Presley.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.600]   Like I'm all about, like let's go on an international trip,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.440]   launch retreat, man.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.480]   Like anything that's gonna be fun.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.280]   Like Robbie C leading worship, the porch.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.120]   I'm in on that.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.040]   You want me to sit still with Jesus?
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.840]   Don't sound like I'm having fun.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   I've got 23,000 emails.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.880]   I just want him to be still and just talk to him.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.840]   I want you to love him.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   He, he wants you to love him.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:09.020]   Know him, learn about him, spend time with him.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.180]   Is this not the gospel?
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.340]   We can't work our way to Jesus that he did the work,
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.660]   that he paid it all.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.600]   We sit still and trust.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.800]   And to model that we've believed upon the gospel,
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.280]   we would say like Martin Luther,
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.680]   I have so much to do in this life.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.440]   It better start by sitting still
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.320]   and letting my God work for me.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.140]   'Cause what am I gonna do without him?
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.540]   There's nothing that I can do for him without him.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.120]   I can't even save myself.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.820]   I need him to pay it all.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.460]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.260]   Father, that is the truth.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.320]   We can't do anything without you.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.640]   We need your help.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:16.120]   Lord, we thank you for the work that you did on our behalf.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.240]   Work we couldn't do,
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.520]   work we literally were not good enough to do.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.020]   'Cause none of us are perfect.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.020]   And so as you required a perfect payment,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.300]   none of us would do.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.240]   It took your son.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   God, thank you for the example of Mary
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.320]   that we might follow it.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.360]   And thank you also for the example of Martha,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   who is with you now, seen as blameless,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.660]   her sins not held against her.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:48.080]   Serving you in your presence
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.600]   forever and ever and ever,
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.960]   sitting with you forever and ever and ever,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   worshiping you forever and ever and ever.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.320]   May we do the same.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:09.120]   It is this reality that Jesus did the work for you.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   Nobody who has ever lived is going to get to heaven
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.440]   because of what they've done,
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.160]   good or bad.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.520]   There is no single deed
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   that is going to keep anyone from heaven.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.400]   No particular sin, no act that you've committed
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.920]   that is gonna be the one thing that keeps you out.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.240]   It's going to come down to one reality.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   Do you believe that roughly 2,000 years ago
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.320]   that God paid a price, paid is the word,
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.640]   paid a price, paid it all,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.440]   all of your sin, past, present, and future,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.640]   on the cross, he paid for it?
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:01.600]   That he died, he paid for it with his own blood,
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.560]   his whole life?
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.680]   He goes in the grave.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.360]   And to show you that he's God,
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.680]   that he's bigger than death,
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.640]   and to give you hope for eternity,
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.120]   and to help you today by the power of his spirit
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.600]   living with you, he raises from the dead.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.680]   Yes, it's good news.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.720]   It's good news that you don't get to heaven
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.360]   because of what you do,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.120]   but because of what Christ did,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   that he paid it all, if you trust in that.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.620]   (congregation applauding)
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.320]   Martha is in heaven.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.000]   We're gonna meet her one day.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.880]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.720]   Not because of what she did,
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:51.600]   but because of the one that she was with, what he did.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.440]   And so if we could talk with you more about that,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.080]   there's a bunch of people here in gray port shirts
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.400]   that serve here, they're co-pastors, co-labors with me.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.240]   They'd love to pray with you and for you.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.840]   If you're in search of community,
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.880]   you're thinking, hey, I need to buy a car,
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.240]   and I don't have anyone to process that with.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.320]   We can change that tonight, okay?
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.120]   Guys, you can walk down this hallway.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.320]   There's a room full of guys there
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.520]   that would love to meet you.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.960]   Girls, you walk down this hallway,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.400]   there's a room full of girls there
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.160]   that would love to meet you.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.000]   And you could just say,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.720]   what is community that he's talking about?
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.320]   And they would love to tell you.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.000]   There's a party out there,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.040]   porch late nights happening tonight.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.760]   So you guys stay, hang out, have fun,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.720]   go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.300]   (upbeat music)
