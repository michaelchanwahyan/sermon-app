1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,340
 - Hi Porsche, my name's Harrison Ross.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,760
 I'm on staff here at Watermark.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,520
 I'm excited to be with you tonight.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,400
 We're gonna dive in.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
 Who here likes art?

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
 Anybody in here like art?

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,840
 Some fans of art?

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
 I love art.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,600
 I grew up going to museums with my mom

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,920
 and it's not the thing most kids are playing on playgrounds

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,400
 and we're sitting quiet in a museum.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,200
 But I learned to love art.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,320
 And one of my favorite artists that is out there today

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,560
 is not the typical ones you'd see in a museum.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,000
 He's not a Da Vinci or a Monet or a Rembrandt.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
 His name is Banksy.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,720
 Anybody familiar with Banksy?

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,280
 Some yes, some no.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
 He is a notorious figure in the art culture

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
 because he is a street artist.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,560
 So he's a graffiti artist.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,520
 He does tagging.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,080
 He does these huge mural artworks

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
 that is more of a social commentary.

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,280
 He's kind of poking fun at the urbanization

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,680
 of our environments and the things that happen

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,200
 when you're in an urban culture.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,140
 So here are a couple pieces by Banksy.

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,040
 This is kind of just, as you see,

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 a kid has to play on a fire hydrant

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,220
 because there's nowhere else to go.

33
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,480
 That's the fun and games.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,800
 Another one is all of our parks are really parking lots.

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,720
 So he just does these tongue-in-cheek things.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,800
 So one thing that he did, he's based in the UK.

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
 He's a London-based artist.

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,200
 He came to the States, to New York, for 30 days

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,080
 to do an installation every day for 30 days.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,320
 This was one of 'em, where he just poked fun

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,440
 at the graffiti in New York City and said,

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
 this is my New York accent,

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
 but this is normally how I talk.

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,000
 And so he just does stuff like this all over the globe.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,880
 While he was in New York City,

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
 this pop-up shop popped up on one of the days

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,120
 full of what looked like Banksy artwork.

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,720
 And so if you've ever been in New York City,

49
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,080
 there are these little shops all over the city

50
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,440
 that they're selling little trinkets,

51
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,560
 they're selling souvenirs,

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
 they're selling really cheap artwork, whatever it is.

53
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,080
 So this is on the outside of Central Park.

54
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,760
 And there is this shop with an old man that you saw

55
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
 who was just yawning, bored to tears,

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,900
 selling what seems to be way overpriced artwork

57
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,120
 compared to all of the other cheap trinkets around it.

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,120
 $60 for a spray-painted stencil on a canvas.

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,560
 Would you pay that?

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
 Thousands of people walk by this booth in one day.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,040
 It sat there for one day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,360
 Thousands of people walk by and see $60, nah.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
 So in the span of a whole day,

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,720
 and this yawning old man, two people buy a painting.

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,320
 Two people think that what they see is worth something,

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,340
 is valuable, is something that they would wanna have.

67
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,320
 Because in this city full of cheap trinkets

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,800
 and a park full of gimmicks and tricks

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
 and T-shirts and novelties,

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,400
 $60 seemed way too expensive, way too high of a value

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,160
 for what really was undervalued by everybody else.

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,800
 Anybody in here feel like that painting

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
 or that group of paintings?

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,440
 Wanting to be wanted?

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,800
 Wanting to feel like you're worth something?

76
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,640
 Maybe 60, maybe more?

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,120
 Everyone just kinda walks by?

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,320
 Nah, maybe a couple glance, maybe a couple want you

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,160
 and you get excited and then it just moves on

80
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,740
 and there's nothing about you that seems exciting

81
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,180
 or lovable.

82
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,720
 In a world full of hurt and sin and selfishness,

83
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,520
 people may look at you, you may even look at yourself

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,400
 and think that you are worthless.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,800
 Because these people would walk around

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
 and they'd undervalue artwork.

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,880
 I think we tend to look at things that are in this world

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
 and we undervalue a lot, it's easy.

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,880
 But I think the things that we undervalue most

90
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,180
 are ourselves.

91
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,320
 I think what you undervalue most is you.

92
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,960
 You think that who you are, how you look,

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,200
 the job that you have, the friends that you hang out,

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,120
 you think that all of that is this perfect symphony

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,920
 that says I'm not good enough, I'm not enough.

96
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,040
 And so we look for value in how much we make,

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,880
 what others think about us, what we do.

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,500
 Our peace of mind is determined by our relationship status,

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,400
 by the car that we drive, what our boss thinks about you,

100
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,480
 what you look in the mirror and think about yourself.

101
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,300
 And it usually is, well, I feel worthless.

102
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,120
 Whether I have nothing or whether I have everything

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,020
 in the world, but we try to just fill this feeling

104
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,020
 to feel valued by stuff, by things, by relationships,

105
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,900
 by careers, by career shifts, by changing cities,

106
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,860
 by doing anything and everything we can,

107
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
 fulfilling sexual desires, just binge watching Netflix

108
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,260
 to numb everything, to eat everything in sight.

109
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,100
 Whatever it is, we try to fill our lives to think

110
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,960
 maybe that will give me value,

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,020
 maybe that will help me feel worth something.

112
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,920
 Tonight I wanna talk about your value.

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,160
 I think it's something that we all wrestle with.

114
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,580
 It's core to who we are, it's our identity.

115
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,040
 It's something that each of us,

116
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,920
 as we're standing in the morning brushing our teeth,

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,320
 I have a sonic hair, shameless plug for dentists out there.

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
 I have a sonic hair and I have to stand there

119
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,380
 for two minutes and stare at the mirror.

120
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,480
 And if I'm honest, when I look at myself

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
 and I judge my love handles or whatever it is,

122
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
 the question that we all have,

123
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,740
 whether we're brushing our teeth or laying in bed is,

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,020
 do I really matter?

125
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,360
 Am I worth something?

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,240
 Do I have a purpose on this earth?

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,280
 Do I have value to anyone else?

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,760
 Do I even look at myself and think

129
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
 that I have value for myself?

130
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:07,440
 Our value is not determined by what others think about us.

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,660
 We're not valuable because of how anyone around you sees you,

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,120
 how you see yourself,

133
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,400
 but how the creator of the universe sees you.

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,840
 And what he says is that you are valuable,

135
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,900
 that you are the most valuable thing on this earth.

136
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,380
 And he is willing to give anything

137
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,300
 and everything that it takes

138
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,900
 because he says that you're valuable.

139
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,740
 If you got your Bibles,

140
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,780
 we're gonna be studying Ephesians 2.10 tonight.

141
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,700
 You can pull that out.

142
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,100
 We'll have it on the screen.

143
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,380
 We're gonna look at one verse

144
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,060
 and we're gonna unpack that together.

145
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,200
 But here's the first thing that you need to know.

146
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,620
 The God of the universe, the creator of the universe

147
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,580
 calls you his masterpiece.

148
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,300
 You are his masterpiece.

149
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,060
 Ephesians 2.10, it starts out like this.

150
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,640
 For we are God's workmanship.

151
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,340
 That word workmanship in the Greek,

152
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,740
 in the original translation that they wrote this in,

153
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,420
 it's called, it says poema.

154
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,980
 That word poema is where we get the term poem.

155
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,700
 That's where a lot of this artwork-themed things

156
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,180
 that we get in our culture comes from.

157
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,100
 And it means handiwork, workmanship,

158
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 craftsmanship, masterpiece.

159
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,500
 That doesn't mean you're perfect.

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,060
 That doesn't mean that there's nothing about you

161
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,940
 that needs to change.

162
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,920
 That doesn't mean that there aren't things

163
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,880
 that are shifting.

164
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,780
 It means that out of what an artist creates,

165
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,580
 you are the crowning, defining, best work.

166
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,640
 Out of the portfolio of all the things

167
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,020
 that this artist has made,

168
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,100
 the masterpiece is the best of creation,

169
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,220
 the best thing that is put on display

170
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,540
 that everyone remembers and it points to him

171
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,380
 and they remember him forever for it.

172
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,540
 That's you, his masterpiece.

173
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,980
 For a summer, I worked as a dude ranch in Wyoming.

174
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,580
 So what I would get to do,

175
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,240
 instead of sleeping in an apartment or a house in Dallas

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 where we really have no beautiful things

177
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,460
 other than great food,

178
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,780
 I would get to wake up and go on top of a mountain

179
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,620
 and I'd go while it's still dark

180
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,900
 and I would sit there and I would watch the world wake up

181
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,740
 and I would watch God paint a beautiful picture

182
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,300
 of a sunrise every day.

183
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,580
 As the sun slowly starts to rise,

184
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,300
 I could see more mountains coming in the distance

185
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,260
 and I would see these color schemes

186
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,700
 and I would see these shadings and these shadows.

187
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,120
 It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen.

188
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,380
 I don't know if you're a mountain guy or girl.

189
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460
 I don't know if you're into the beach.

190
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,700
 I don't know what it is that you think

191
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,900
 is the most beautiful thing of creation.

192
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,460
 But Genesis 1 talks that God is the creator.

193
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,820
 He created the heavens and the earth

194
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,660
 and everything that we see, the animals,

195
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,220
 the majestic things, the sunrise and sunset,

196
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,940
 every day and out of all that God created,

197
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,120
 you are the best of creation.

198
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,940
 You are his masterpiece.

199
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,900
 You believe that?

200
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,500
 I don't.

201
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
 I don't.

202
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,140
 I mean, it inspires me.

203
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,580
 I know it.

204
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,100
 I know it is true in Scripture.

205
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,860
 I know it is true in this verse.

206
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,040
 But if I'm honest with myself and with you,

207
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,780
 I don't believe that about myself

208
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,580
 when I'm brushing my teeth in the mirror in the morning.

209
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,380
 I feel like a failure.

210
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,460
 I feel like a fake.

211
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,780
 I feel like I don't even like myself most days

212
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,620
 when I'm looking at it.

213
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,700
 And so really, I need to hear this message as much as you.

214
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,880
 I don't know where you are tonight.

215
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,060
 I don't know what you're thinking,

216
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,620
 what thoughts that you have going through your mind.

217
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,620
 Do you feel like a masterpiece?

218
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,220
 God calls you his masterpiece.

219
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,740
 If I'm such a masterpiece,

220
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
 then why does my body look like this?

221
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,940
 I mean, supermodels are a masterpiece.

222
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,340
 Sure, I get that.

223
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,900
 But you see this body that I got?

224
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,040
 You're talking about love handles.

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,940
 I've got some love handles that are unlovable, buddy.

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,760
 Check this out.

227
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,000
 I'm no masterpiece.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,940
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece,

229
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,140
 then why am I still single

230
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
 while all my friends are getting married?

231
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,620
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece,

232
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,740
 then why does my life suck?

233
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,320
 You see the car I drive?

234
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,120
 All my friends have this push button start.

235
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,860
 I don't have a button I can push on my fob.

236
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,780
 I'm still putting in a car key

237
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,300
 that I got to get from Home Depot

238
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,420
 'cause I lost the other one.

239
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,500
 I'm still stuck in the 1980s in this thing.

240
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
 We're coming up on summer

241
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,040
 and I have to get a spray fan

242
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,840
 to just keep from not sweating.

243
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
 I'm either gonna sweat or be soaking wet.

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,280
 Either way, my life sucks.

245
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,580
 Masterpiece.

246
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,220
 You know where I work?

247
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,040
 I'm not slinging pizzas around and delivering pizzas,

248
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,540
 but I'd rather do that than the job that I hate.

249
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,180
 I hate myself because of where I work.

250
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,360
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece, what about that?

251
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,600
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece,

252
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,560
 then why do I feel like my boss tears me apart

253
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
 every time I meet with him?

254
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,600
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece,

255
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,860
 then why did he break up with me

256
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,300
 when I thought I'd marry him?

257
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,940
 If I'm so much of a masterpiece,

258
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,140
 why do I get rejected by every girl that I ask out?

259
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,780
 I don't see me as a masterpiece.

260
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,180
 How can God see me as a masterpiece?

261
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,920
 Well, maybe you are the masterpiece

262
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,380
 that everyone's trying to be.

263
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,160
 Maybe you don't look at yourself and go,

264
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
 man, my life's terrible.

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
 Maybe you're going, yeah.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,800
 Valet'd my Tesla or Range Rover on the way in here.

267
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,500
 Fresh press suit, beautiful girlfriend.

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,840
 Yeah, I am that masterpiece,

269
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,780
 but if I'm so much of that masterpiece,

270
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,740
 then why do I really hate myself?

271
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,840
 If I am this masterpiece that most everyone else

272
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,180
 in this room wants to be, why do I still feel no value?

273
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,720
 I've got more money than any of my friends around me,

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,700
 but I am nowhere near happy.

275
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,700
 I finally got the job and the promotion

276
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,320
 that I've been working for for three years

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,060
 and had no life to get,

278
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,260
 but I don't feel any more valued or loved.

279
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,940
 I've got the girlfriend that everyone thinks

280
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,280
 is the most beautiful in the world,

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,140
 but I don't feel valued.

282
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,320
 Masterpiece?

283
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
 Me?

284
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,080
 Masterpiece of crap, maybe,

285
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,620
 but God calls you his masterpiece.

286
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,060
 The reason that we don't feel like a masterpiece

287
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,400
 is because we're looking to all the wrong things

288
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,640
 to give us value.

289
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,600
 You're looking all around you.

290
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,040
 You're looking within you.

291
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,140
 You're looking to the stuff, to the things,

292
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,200
 to the desires, the fulfillment.

293
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,500
 You're looking at everything that will fill you,

294
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
 all of what will fill you,

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
 and the reason you're not being fulfilled

296
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,340
 and feeling valued is because you're not looking

297
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,040
 to the person who can.

298
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
 You're looking to you.

299
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,180
 You're looking to everyone else and everything else,

300
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,660
 because the truth is God is the one who gives you value.

301
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,400
 He calls you his masterpiece,

302
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
 and he gives you value because he is the artist of your life.

303
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,340
 He's the best artist that ever created.

304
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,160
 Better than Kanye, don't tell him.

305
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,900
 Better than Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Picasso.

306
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,880
 Better than any artist that has ever lived,

307
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,040
 and he has a purpose for your life, a plan for your life.

308
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,680
 He has a perfect picture in mind of what he wants for you.

309
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,220
 He's forming you, shaping you, molding you,

310
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,260
 intentionally creating a beautiful picture

311
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,600
 with every stroke, every color.

312
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,660
 Every gift, every talent,

313
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,400
 every way he created you is purposeful,

314
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,100
 because he's the artist, not you.

315
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,740
 You don't define your value.

316
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,840
 We want to, we try to, we think we can, we would rather,

317
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,680
 but God is the one who gives you value.

318
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,820
 God is the one who created you in the first place.

319
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,420
 Psalm 139 talks about he has knit you in his mother's womb.

320
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,680
 He has formed you, he has shaped you.

321
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
 He already made you.

322
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,220
 But we then try to turn around and think that,

323
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,560
 well, we're not good enough, I don't feel that value,

324
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,960
 I'm not enough, and so I've gotta do something

325
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,560
 that's gonna make me feel valuable.

326
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,140
 If you've ever been to a museum,

327
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,300
 you see all these pictures hanging on a wall,

328
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,980
 some of them really well-known,

329
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,420
 some of them not so well-known,

330
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,880
 and you could step away and go,

331
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,140
 wow, this is wonderful,

332
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,180
 but if you ever go really up close to a painting,

333
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,780
 it really kinda sucks.

334
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,920
 I don't care who the painter is.

335
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,320
 You go up close, and if you've never seen from far away,

336
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,120
 my own judgmental eye can just go,

337
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,700
 okay, this is a bunch of random brush strokes,

338
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,100
 globs of paint, random colors that are put together.

339
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,640
 There's nothing special about this,

340
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,840
 but when you step away,

341
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,780
 you see that there is a picture

342
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,340
 that someone other than the viewer or the canvas itself

343
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,640
 has perfectly put in place

344
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,780
 because it followed a plan that he had.

345
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,760
 What seemed like random strokes and crazy colors

346
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,620
 and things that don't seem to fit together

347
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,620
 form to be a beautiful picture and a masterpiece.

348
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,860
 Up close, when we look at ourselves

349
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,040
 or allow others to look at us or we look at others,

350
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,340
 we may seem like there's nothing special,

351
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,540
 but when you look from God's perspective,

352
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,640
 because he created you and he is the artist of your life,

353
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,940
 he gives you value and defines that you are good.

354
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,640
 For you are his workmanship, Ephesians 2:10 says.

355
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,480
 It goes on to say, created in Christ Jesus.

356
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
 He has already made you

357
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
 when you came out of your mother's womb,

358
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,220
 but then he creates us anew in Christ Jesus,

359
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,100
 but we don't even like that,

360
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,660
 and we try to be our own artist.

361
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,460
 It seems kind of controlling of God

362
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,860
 if he's up there with the paintbrushes,

363
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,040
 and so what we try to do is go over

364
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,080
 and snatch the paintbrush out of his hand

365
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,340
 and go, all right, God, you know what?

366
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,740
 This plan that you've got for me

367
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
 is not really working out for me,

368
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,340
 so I'm gonna take it from here.

369
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,280
 Good, good, up there.

370
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
 You're turning into Harry Potter, whatever it is.

371
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,320
 (congregation laughing)

372
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
 And we think that we are gonna create a masterpiece

373
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 greater than he can.

374
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
 Well, good luck.

375
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,100
 So let's pretend this is me.

376
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,400
 This canvas is my life,

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,200
 and on here is my plan for my life.

378
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,500
 On here is when I'm a kid, what I dreamt of being,

379
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,140
 what I thought one day I'll grow up,

380
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,980
 I'll be the first man on Mars, fail.

381
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,680
 I am terrible at math, and it's never gonna happen.

382
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,620
 SpaceX will get there, Harrison will not get there.

383
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,120
 This is my plan for my life.

384
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,760
 I'm not gonna be a World Cup soccer player,

385
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,520
 but I can continue along the path that I have for me

386
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,220
 or that I think God would have me go on.

387
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,220
 And so through junior high and high school,

388
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,000
 I grew up in a good Christian family,

389
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,960
 and I go along the road and I try to follow this path,

390
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,100
 and I'm going along, and it's good, it's vibrant,

391
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,980
 it's colorful, it's bright, it's fun.

392
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,480
 I became a believer when I was really young.

393
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,380
 I came to know Jesus and I found life in him

394
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,940
 and knowing the Bible stories

395
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,340
 and knowing all of these things.

396
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,460
 And I started to run with some friends in high school,

397
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,860
 at least I thought they were friends.

398
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,560
 In college, it started to come into more of a picture

399
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,800
 of what I wanted to do, what I thought I would do,

400
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,500
 and along the way, I started to see growth.

401
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,960
 I started to see that people liked me.

402
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,060
 I started to see, man, this is kind of working out.

403
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,340
 I like this brush.

404
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,400
 This is nice.

405
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,880
 This is a picture that I wanna fill in.

406
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,480
 I'd love to go down this road.

407
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,780
 This feels good.

408
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,580
 People like me, they affirm me, they wanna be around me.

409
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,480
 And so I started going to church

410
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,220
 'cause that's where all my friends were going,

411
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,460
 and what do you do?

412
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,260
 And I started growing, or at least saying I was.

413
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,660
 And I started getting involved in college

414
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,100
 and all these organizations,

415
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,260
 and again, people were liking me,

416
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,640
 and it seemed like on the outside, all was going well.

417
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,540
 I started dating a girl, junior in high school.

418
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,700
 She's so hot.

419
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,340
 I can say that because we were prom king and queen together

420
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,880
 and then she became my wife and she's still so hot,

421
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,140
 hotter than ever.

422
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,640
 And so my life was really going great.

423
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,180
 But see, all the while, on the outside,

424
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,520
 you're looking at my picture and you're like,

425
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,060
 okay, dude, that's really not that awesome,

426
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,560
 but I thought it was.

427
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,920
 But all the while, what's kind of creeping in there

428
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,220
 in this little vibrancy of my life in Christ,

429
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,460
 right in the middle is this secret addiction to pornography.

430
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,500
 But hey, all the rest is good.

431
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,840
 It's just a little blemish.

432
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,040
 It's not even a solar eclipse.

433
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,880
 We're fine.

434
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,100
 So I move on and I keep going through college

435
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,980
 and I try to keep looking for accolades

436
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,580
 and I then try to go into the working world

437
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,980
 and I end up marrying the wife of my youth

438
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,580
 and we're growing and it's going great.

439
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:47,360
 But still this little thing starts creeping in,

440
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,500
 starts filling in down over here.

441
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,860
 This little clicking in high school

442
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,200
 turned into a 12-year addiction of pornography for me.

443
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,400
 So that maybe there was growth on this side,

444
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,780
 but the growth was being stunted over here.

445
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,680
 So then I get into the working world

446
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
 and I'm really enjoying what I'm doing

447
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,880
 and it seems kind of good,

448
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,980
 but this growth is kind of starting to look a little darker

449
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,720
 because when I look at myself in the mirror,

450
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,120
 I'm not really loving what I see.

451
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,460
 I seem successful.

452
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,000
 I had friends,

453
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,060
 but I didn't really have any close friends.

454
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,560
 I had success in high school, success in the work world.

455
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,440
 I had a relationship and a wife,

456
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,600
 but deep down I didn't really like it.

457
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,840
 I was full of depression.

458
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,520
 Although I had this addiction that I really struggled with,

459
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,680
 I had friends who helped me

460
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,620
 and there was some growth over here,

461
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,520
 but growth was kind of still in and out of it,

462
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,580
 in and out of struggling with that.

463
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,180
 Even today, I haven't been there for 12 years.

464
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,760
 I know the truth of who Jesus is,

465
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,720
 but most days, if I'm honest,

466
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,520
 I'd really love to go look at porn.

467
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,120
 It makes me feel valuable.

468
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,360
 It makes me feel wanted.

469
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,900
 I have a wife who loves me.

470
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,000
 I have a savior who loves me,

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,800
 but every day I have this desire to go,

472
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,400
 man, I could go have an entire worldwide web want me.

473
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,780
 And then I have this lingering prideful thoughts

474
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,540
 and all of these things that are creeping through my life.

475
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,280
 Again, I feel in my job like a failure.

476
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
 I feel depressed.

477
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,720
 I feel like I'm not really loving what I'm doing most times.

478
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,960
 When I look in the mirror, that's what I see,

479
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,460
 but I'm at church.

480
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,960
 So then I just try to mask it.

481
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
 I just try to pray more.

482
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,100
 I just try to read more Bible.

483
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,780
 I just try to go to church more and go to the porch more.

484
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,540
 I try to give more money.

485
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,740
 I try to make it look like that addiction has gone away.

486
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,420
 I try to look like I'm doing all the right things,

487
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,920
 but all these good works that I thought

488
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,560
 would make things new are just clouding in my picture.

489
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,160
 No matter how hard I try on the stuff

490
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,800
 that I've already done or even on the new stuff up here,

491
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,500
 my picture really doesn't look anything

492
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,080
 like when I first started.

493
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,440
 So I go, you know what?

494
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,040
 I'm just gonna start over.

495
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,740
 I'm just gonna create a new me.

496
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,420
 It's 2018, New Year's resolutions.

497
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,240
 We're gonna start over.

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,080
 All that's behind me.

499
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,180
 I'm just gonna wipe it all away.

500
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,560
 I'm gonna get rid of it.

501
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,060
 We're gonna start fresh.

502
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,560
 It's a new Harrison.

503
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,920
 It's a new me.

504
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,560
 No more bad things.

505
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 And I'll just kinda start fresh,

506
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,100
 and now my picture is almost completely unrecognizable

507
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,700
 from what it was before.

508
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:02,140
 Now I'm no art expert, but that's a masterpiece.

509
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,780
 Anybody crazy enough to buy this panty?

510
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,660
 I'll give it to you for 60 bucks.

511
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,480
 Yeah?

512
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,420
 Come see me afterwards.

513
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,920
 It's yours.

514
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,160
 I'm gonna get away.

515
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,860
 I should start preaching more often.

516
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,160
 (congregation laughing)

517
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,060
 I look at my life knowing full well

518
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,500
 of what God says of me that I'm his masterpiece,

519
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,240
 and when I look at me in the mirror,

520
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
 all I see is a mess.

521
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
 All I see is a disaster.

522
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,780
 I don't see a work of art

523
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,940
 that is worthy of being displayed,

524
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,580
 worthy of being paid for,

525
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,240
 worthy of even being given away.

526
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,820
 I see trash.

527
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
 'Cause when I try and take the paintbrushes,

528
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,680
 when I try to fill in my life,

529
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,320
 I take it from God,

530
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,760
 what ends up happening is I make a disaster of my life.

531
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,200
 In the good things that I do,

532
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,300
 in the great things that I wanna accomplish,

533
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,300
 in the things that start to creep in and crowd my life

534
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
 and darken my world,

535
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,540
 I made a mess out of my life,

536
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,600
 and so did you.

537
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,940
 (congregation laughing)

538
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,880
 But Jesus recreates us.

539
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,080
 Jesus isn't gonna just let us stay there.

540
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,280
 This context of Ephesians 2:10

541
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,240
 is in the wider context of a passage,

542
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,920
 and I just wanna read it for you

543
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,780
 because it's a passage that has incredibly marked my life,

544
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,680
 the truth in Ephesians 2:10

545
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,620
 because of the truth in one through nine,

546
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,020
 and you need to see it.

547
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,400
 Here's what it says.

548
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,360
 You were dead in the trespasses and sins

549
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,760
 in which you once walked,

550
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,260
 following the course of this world,

551
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,400
 following the prince of the power of the air,

552
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,540
 the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,

553
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,400
 among whom we all once lived,

554
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,940
 in the passions of our flesh,

555
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,740
 carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind,

556
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,320
 and were by nature children of wrath

557
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,020
 like the rest of mankind, but God.

558
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,660
 One through three is my life.

559
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,220
 One through three is where some of you sit.

560
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,860
 But I don't create myself.

561
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,040
 God does.

562
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,240
 Verse four, it says,

563
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,540
 "But God, being rich in mercy

564
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,800
 "because of the great love with which he loved us

565
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,080
 "even when we were dead in our trespasses,

566
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
 "made us alive together with Christ.

567
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,080
 "It is by grace that you have been saved

568
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,280
 "and raised us up with him,

569
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,220
 "seated us with him in the heavenly places

570
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,820
 "in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages

571
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,680
 "he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace

572
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,560
 "and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.

573
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,860
 "For by grace you have been saved through faith."

574
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,560
 This is not of your own doing.

575
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,540
 This is nothing you can do to make yourself better,

576
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,900
 to work yourself into anything.

577
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,240
 This is the gift of God,

578
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,140
 not a result of works so that no one may boast,

579
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,140
 for we are his workmanship,

580
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,320
 created in Christ Jesus for good works

581
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,220
 so that we may walk in them.

582
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,580
 Jesus recreates us into his masterpiece.

583
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,120
 We can come to him.

584
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,320
 We can ask him.

585
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,060
 We can say, "Lord, I don't feel like I have any value

586
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,800
 "or anything I try to add value

587
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,900
 "is doing anything in my life but making a mess,

588
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,300
 "so I want you to come in."

589
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,500
 And when we pray that,

590
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
 we think that Jesus is gonna come in

591
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,600
 and just fix this little area right here.

592
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,740
 Okay.

593
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,500
 That was good.

594
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,340
 That's all I can handle.

595
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,080
 (congregation laughing)

596
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,580
 And so I pray again the next day,

597
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,980
 and I think that my little Jesus is gonna come in

598
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,820
 and maybe he'll just smooth this out.

599
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,660
 Maybe he'll bring a little of the old vibrant life

600
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,160
 into some of the new life.

601
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,000
 We picture Jesus sometimes

602
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400
 as this tiny little toothbrush of a God

603
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,960
 that comes in to fix our tiny blemishes

604
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,100
 because that's all he's big enough to do.

605
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,600
 That's not my God.

606
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,840
 That's not Jesus.

607
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,180
 Jesus came and he died for me.

608
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,980
 He came and he died for you.

609
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,540
 Not to come and just make little parts of your life better,

610
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,920
 but he came to make you a new creation.

611
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,720
 He came to make you his masterpiece,

612
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,280
 regardless of what you've done,

613
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,680
 regardless of what you will do,

614
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,460
 regardless of how you see yourself,

615
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,320
 how anyone around you sees you,

616
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,820
 regardless if you think that you are

617
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,120
 the most unlovable person in the room or on the planet,

618
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,400
 he died for you.

619
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,340
 He came to earth, he dwelt among us.

620
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,660
 He then allowed himself to be nailed to a tree,

621
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,440
 crucified to die so that his blood could cover you

622
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,940
 so that your life is not just fixed

623
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,940
 by a couple little brushstrokes of his grace,

624
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,220
 but so that your life, all the screw-ups and mess-ups

625
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,380
 and everything that could be is dumped

626
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
 in the goodness of who God is,

627
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,160
 in his grace, in his love, in his kindness,

628
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,560
 in his goodness.

629
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,060
 (congregation applauding)

630
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,200
 So that as you look at your life,

631
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,800
 all that was there fades away.

632
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,340
 All that is there that could make you feel unlovable

633
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,240
 or worthless disappears and all you see is Jesus.

634
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,180
 When God looks at you, he doesn't see a mess-up,

635
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,120
 he doesn't see a screw-up, he sees Jesus.

636
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,960
 He sees the blood of his son that was poured out for you

637
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,200
 so that you could know that you are his masterpiece.

638
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,040
 What God doesn't do is make the canvas disappear,

639
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,740
 make it all fade away or make it go white again,

640
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,720
 but red runs all over this place

641
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,040
 because his grace is what sets us free.

642
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,320
 His grace is what gives us life.

643
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,780
 God is the artist of your life, not you.

644
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,420
 He defines your value.

645
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:24,120
 And guys, what art is supposed to do

646
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,360
 is art glorifies the creator.

647
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,900
 Art is meant to be on display.

648
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,840
 It's at rest.

649
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
 It doesn't do anything.

650
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,240
 It hangs on a wall and it just is on display

651
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,680
 for what the artist intended it to be,

652
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,480
 intended for it to do.

653
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,860
 It doesn't look for value from the museum-goer.

654
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,360
 It doesn't sit there on a wall and just go,

655
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,920
 is someone gonna like me today?

656
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,800
 Do you think more people are gonna come and want me?

657
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,460
 More people are gonna wanna read their pamphlet

658
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,400
 and think that I'm worth something and valuable?

659
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,760
 You think that people are gonna come

660
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
 and think that I'm good or better

661
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
 than the ones next to me?

662
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,440
 I mean, how crazy would it be

663
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,820
 if the Mona Lisa is sitting in its little

664
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,280
 like plexiglass cage, hanging on that wall

665
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,620
 and goes, man, I really wish Da Vinci

666
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,820
 would've given me a more timeless hairstyle.

667
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,920
 I really wish he would've made me look a little less frumpy.

668
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
 I really wish that my color palette

669
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 was a little more like my modern art friends over there.

670
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,940
 Or Starry Nights, hanging on the wall

671
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,340
 and just going, man, I'm not that clear.

672
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,680
 I'm not a realist painting.

673
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,240
 I'm a little blurry and splotchy

674
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,280
 and no one can really tell what I am.

675
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,980
 Man, I wish that someone could actually care for me.

676
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,120
 These are some of the most widely known paintings

677
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,180
 in the whole world.

678
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,560
 It sounds ridiculous because many of us

679
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,620
 just look around and go, well, she's getting married.

680
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,960
 How come I'm not?

681
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,400
 He's got the job that he loves.

682
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,260
 How come I don't?

683
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,460
 Everyone else feels like they're getting invited

684
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,300
 and they're living a life of their dreams.

685
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,840
 How come I am not?

686
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,400
 And we're looking to find value all around us

687
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,400
 instead of the value that God has given us to walk in.

688
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,580
 The end of that verse says that you are created

689
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,620
 in Christ Jesus for good works,

690
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,920
 which he prepared beforehand so that you could walk in them.

691
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,600
 Art is at rest because it doesn't have to do anything.

692
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
 It doesn't have to prove itself.

693
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,760
 It doesn't have to make itself new

694
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,500
 or remake itself into something else

695
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
 so that someone will value it.

696
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,840
 It is who the creator made it and it is at rest

697
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,240
 and it does nothing.

698
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,240
 Guys, your purpose is to glorify God,

699
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,040
 exactly how he's made you, uniquely how he's made you.

700
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,620
 When he created you, he specifically thought

701
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,920
 of what you would look like, who you would be,

702
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,760
 the personality you would have,

703
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,900
 the gifts that you would have,

704
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,360
 the skills that you would have,

705
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,000
 and he put you uniquely on this earth

706
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,100
 for you to glorify him in ways that no one else could.

707
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,200
 There's lots of different kinds of art out there,

708
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,540
 realism, impressionism, statues, pottery,

709
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,500
 little tiny cloth paintings.

710
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,640
 All of us are unique.

711
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,440
 All of us are created with different gifts

712
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,940
 and abilities and desires and things that we love

713
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,220
 and things that we can give love to others,

714
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,320
 but all of us are his masterpiece

715
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
 put here to be on display for his glory.

716
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,360
 God made you.

717
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,740
 Walk in it.

718
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:46,300
 God made you his masterpiece.

719
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,540
 Go be the Mona Lisa.

720
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,600
 Be the starry night.

721
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,780
 Be all that God made you to be.

722
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,940
 Be Jessica.

723
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,440
 Be Samuel.

724
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
 Be Zach.

725
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,620
 Be Hannah.

726
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,520
 Be who God uniquely made you and glorify him in it

727
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,920
 because he defines your value as the artist of your life

728
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,200
 and he calls you his masterpiece.

729
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,600
 [congregation laughing]

730
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,940
 In that situation in New York,

731
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,000
 people are walking by this booth

732
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,640
 of all these different paintings

733
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,280
 and throughout the whole day,

734
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,280
 two people bought paintings for $60.

735
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,360
 Seemed a little more than what maybe

736
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,060
 the other people thought they were worth.

737
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,060
 The next day, art experts realized what had happened

738
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,400
 and they were authentic Banksy artworks

739
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,860
 that each was valued at around $31,000.

740
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,940
 And so for one day in the middle of Central Park,

741
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,140
 there was a booth set up of what's estimated

742
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,980
 around $250 million worth of artwork

743
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,740
 that most people just walked by and said,

744
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,580
 "That seems worthless."

745
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,280
 That's the world we live in, guys.

746
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,260
 Whether you see yourself, the person next to you,

747
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,560
 your roommate or how any else sees you,

748
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,520
 we undervalue who we think we are

749
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,740
 or defined by the value of everything else around us

750
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,700
 because we don't know the artist.

751
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,780
 God wrote his signature on your life

752
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,080
 for those who know him and have trusted in him

753
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,820
 and choose to walk in his ways

754
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,820
 and surrender your life to him

755
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,780
 and he calls you his masterpiece,

756
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,680
 signed in his blood and he washes it all away.

757
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,580
 (congregation murmuring)

758
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,180
 For we are his workmanship,

759
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,680
 created in Christ Jesus for good works,

760
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,160
 which he prepared beforehand so that we may walk in it.

761
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,200
 Go, walk in it, be his people.

762
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,300
 Let me pray.

763
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,400
 Heavenly Father, we love you.

764
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,240
 Thank you that you love us, that you created us,

765
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,300
 you have formed us, you have shaped us,

766
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,680
 you have made us in the likeness of who you are.

767
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,120
 Lord, even though we try to define our life

768
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,540
 based on the things around us

769
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,180
 or the things that we see in ourselves,

770
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,080
 none of that is gonna give us value.

771
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,960
 None of that is gonna give us worth,

772
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,980
 only by how you see us.

773
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,820
 Nothing that we can do, nothing that we can fix

774
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,760
 from our past or do in our future,

775
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,100
 but all what you have already done for us.

776
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,540
 So Lord, thank you for the blood of Jesus

777
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,040
 that washes over our lives and makes us a new creation,

778
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,080
 that we are your children and we are your masterpiece.

779
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,320
 God, I pray for people in here who do not feel that.

780
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,980
 Maybe they know it, but they absolutely do not feel that.

781
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,620
 By your spirit, Lord, I pray that they would know

782
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,260
 that you love them, you're crazy about them.

783
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,200
 And I pray that you'd call them to yourself.

784
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
 I pray for people in here who do know you,

785
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,200
 but just don't believe that truth

786
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,140
 and are thinking that we have to fix ourselves

787
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,600
 and make ourselves better.

788
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,440
 Lord, help us believe that we are your creation

789
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,040
 and be at rest in that and glorify you.

790
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,000
 We love you.

791
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,100
 This is in Jesus' name.

792
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:28,100
