[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   Hey Porch, join me as we read God's word together.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.780]   From the Gospel of Mark, chapter 4, verses 35 through 41.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.460]   On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.740]   And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.160]   And other boats were with him.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.200]   And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.540]   was already filling.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.620]   But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.320]   And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.940]   And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace, be still."
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.720]   And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.580]   He said to them, "Why are you so afraid?
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.960]   Have you still no faith?"
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.680]   And they were filled with great fear, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   even the wind and the sea obey him?"
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.320]   And now our seventh message in our series called "Disciple."
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.000]   Well, what's up Porch?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   How we doing tonight?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   All right.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.840]   Hey, I do want to give a quick shout out to everyone watching online tonight.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240]   Porch Life Springfield, welcome to the mix.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.000]   I know you guys are new, getting up and running.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.720]   We got Porch Life Fresno, Porch Life Scottsdale, it's amazing that you guys are jumping in
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.040]   with us.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.440]   Hey, my name's Timothy Atik, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.600]   I am not normally here on Tuesdays, but I love any chance I get to be here.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.960]   I did not know I was going to be here tonight.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   I got a call this morning, probably between nine or 10 from Kylan, and he was like, "Hey
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.880]   man, do you remember when you had your child on a Tuesday at breakaway and you needed someone
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880]   else to speak?"
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   I was like, "Yes."
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   He's like, "I need you to do that for me tonight."
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   Because Cash Levi Perry was born today.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.320]   So I don't know, yeah.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.880]   I don't know if they've got the live stream on just to introduce Cash to the porch.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.920]   That'd be a good way to start his first day on this earth.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.080]   But Brooke and Kylan, we are so excited for you guys and can't wait to meet Cash.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.560]   So that means you get me tonight, and I'm so glad to be here with you on election night.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.520]   Anytime that I have the chance to teach the Word of God, I love to give people an opportunity
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   just to pray before we do that.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.000]   So if you join us on Sundays, and if you don't have a home church, please come join us on
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Sundays.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We'd love to have you.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.520]   But right now I want to invite you to take a second and just pray.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:12.800]   Say, "God, would you speak clearly to me tonight?"
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.680]   And then I want to invite you to pray for the people around you.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:25.360]   Just say, "God, speak clearly to them."
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.320]   And then I want to ask you to pray for me.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.560]   Just say, "God, would you speak clearly through T.A. to us tonight?"
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.800]   Well, Lord, I pray that you give us eyes to see you and ears to hear from you.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.440]   God, I pray that our hearts would be receptive to all that you want to say in Jesus' name.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   Amen.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.720]   Hey, so I wasn't planning on being here, as I've already shared.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.640]   And so I'm just going to warn you from now.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.480]   I am giving a talk I've given at the porch before, about two and a half years ago.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.360]   Some of this might sound familiar to some of you.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.840]   I'm just OK with that.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.520]   Like I am not under any impression that you remember what I say, what I said two and a
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.440]   half years ago.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.240]   And sometimes a movie is better the second time you see it.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   OK?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.160]   So I hope it's an encouragement to you.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.720]   If some of the stories are familiar, you can just laugh as hard as you did the first round.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   All right?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.280]   And that'll make me feel really good.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.080]   So several years ago, when my two boys—I have three boys now—but when my two oldest
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   boys, when they were about two and a half and five months old, I made a very unfortunate
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.160]   decision as a dad.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.560]   And that was to attempt to drive from Austin to Dallas with my two boys, but without my
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   wife.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.080]   Like, I was planning to fly solo just myself.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   So we began to make our way up I-35, and for the first hour of the trip, I was crushing
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.960]   it as a dad, primarily because both kids were asleep.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.640]   And then we got to around the temple area, if you're familiar with that drive up 35,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   and my kids were awake.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.280]   And so I decided that it was time for us to stop off at the Chick-fil-A in Temple to have
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   lunch.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.480]   And so I literally, I pulled into the parking space in the Chick-fil-A of Temple, Texas,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.160]   and I sat for a minute and I just evaluated everything that needed to happen in order
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.840]   for me to get in and out with my two boys without dying.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.400]   And so I felt like I had my game plan.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.760]   I got out of the car.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.280]   I had Andrew in the car carrier in one hand.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.720]   I had the diaper bag slung over my chest.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.560]   I had Noah, my two and a half year old, in the other hand, and we are walking in to Chick-fil-A.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.360]   And you could just see the sympathy on the Chick-fil-A worker's face.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   He was like, "My pleasure."
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.860]   Like, it's always their pleasure, but this time it was absolutely his pleasure.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:58.200]   So we go into the Chick-fil-A, I order, and we sit down, and everything is going perfect
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:06.760]   during lunch until my five-month-old Andrew, who's in the car seat, just destroys his diaper.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   Like right there in the middle of my number one with no pickles in Chick-fil-A sauce.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.920]   Like he just absolutely destroyed his diaper.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.840]   It was the type of thing that if I was going to be a good dad, I'm not going to finish
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.360]   my lunch before changing him.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560]   I'm going to change him now.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.320]   So I gathered up all of our stuff.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.520]   We went into the bathroom of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.240]   I pulled down the changing table.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.640]   I put my five-month-old on it.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.760]   I tell my two-and-a-half-year-old, "Noah, stand right here.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.520]   Just stand right here."
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.240]   And I just begin ferociously wiping Andrew down.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.600]   Like I'm trying to clean this kid off.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.800]   And right as I'm cleaning him off, he goes to the bathroom, a different number this time,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.360]   and he floods the changing table.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.960]   Like this thing is out of order.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.200]   Like he floods the changing table.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.320]   And right as he floods the changing table, I use my last wet wipe.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.040]   So I just want to put you, I want to put you there, people.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.760]   Okay, I just want you to, I want you to imagine, here I am in the Chick-fil-A of Temple, Texas.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:25.480]   I am holding a bare-bottomed baby up in the air with nowhere to put him and nothing to
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.640]   clean him up with.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.880]   You might be like, "That sounds like worst-case scenario."
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   It wasn't.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.600]   You want to know what the worst-case scenario was?
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.360]   The worst-case scenario was holding a bare-bottomed baby in the air with nowhere to put him and
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.280]   nothing to wipe him down with, looking left, just in time to see your two-and-a-half-year-old
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.000]   playing with the urinal cake.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   That's the worst-case scenario.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.520]   So let's talk about stress tonight.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.200]   Because I will tell you, when I was standing there in that bathroom, I felt stressed out,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.360]   overwhelmed, and out of control.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.920]   That is what I felt in that moment.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.240]   And that was just for a day.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   Praise the Lord, I got out of that situation, and that stress only lasted for a brief time.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   But here's the reality.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.640]   Some of you guys have much more significant things going on in your life, and it's causing
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   stress.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.720]   And we're talking about it on Election Night, because some of you just sang "I Trust God,"
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.160]   but the reality is, is you might feel like the world is over if your candidate doesn't
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   win.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   And you're like, "Man, is this it?
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.240]   Am I leaving the country?
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.960]   Is Jesus coming back tomorrow?"
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.400]   Like for you, it's deeply stressful.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:52.400]   Or maybe your life has just not turned out how you thought that it would at this age.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.520]   Maybe you're not living up to your own expectations, and that's really stressing you out.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   Or it's that time of year where bonuses are just kind of that close that you're beginning
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.920]   to wonder, "How much is it going to be?
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.040]   Am I going to get it?
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.240]   Will there be a promotion?
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.680]   Is there not going to be a promotion?
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.720]   Am I about to lose my job?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.440]   Is my company going to downsize?
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.680]   Inflation is kind of a thing.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.280]   Holidays are coming up."
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:29.120]   For some people, that spells disaster when it comes to being with family.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.640]   Maybe you're in a relationship and you're just wondering what the timeline of this thing
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.880]   even is.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.480]   There's just so much to be stressed out about.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.080]   Some of you are stressed and you don't even know why you're stressed, you just know you
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   are.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.880]   Like if any of those things are going on in your life, I just wouldn't be surprised if
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.340]   you don't feel what I felt standing in that Chick-fil-A bathroom.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.560]   If you're honest, you feel stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.400]   Here's the good news.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.280]   According to the Scriptures, what I want to show you tonight is that stress isn't inevitable,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.880]   it's actually optional.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.080]   Like what I want to invite you into tonight is I just want to invite you into peace and
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.400]   I want to share four truths from the Word of God that speak directly, directly to your
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.520]   peace and what you do with these four truths will have everything to do with whether your
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.720]   soul feels chaotic or calm tonight and in the days ahead.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.560]   It will impact whether you live under pressure or filled with peace.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.960]   Stress isn't inevitable, it's actually optional.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.760]   So if you have a Bible, I want to invite you to turn with me to Mark chapter 4.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.680]   Mark chapter 4 is where we're going to be.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.040]   Now as you're turning there, I really need you to listen, okay?
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.600]   Because some of you all just heard me say that stress isn't inevitable, it's actually
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.760]   optional and that stressed you out.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.640]   It stressed you out that I said you shouldn't be stressed out.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.600]   So here's what I want to make sure you hear.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:08.160]   Some of you guys in here, like you have, you have like clinical anxiety.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   And if that's you, I want to make sure you know I'm not speaking about your clinical
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.360]   anxiety, like your anxiety disorder.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.160]   That's not what I'm speaking to tonight.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   And so I want you to feel the weight lift from you that I'm not trying to put a weight
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   on you that's going to feel crushing right now.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:36.080]   What I'm trying to speak to, as I'm speaking to the everyday stress that the good majority
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:44.160]   of us allow to weigh us down when we have a Savior and a King who is before all things
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.640]   and in Him all things hold together.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:54.840]   I'm just trying to invite, I'm trying to invite us closer to Jesus and to peace.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.320]   So we're looking at Mark chapter 4.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.440]   The gospel of Mark was written by a guy named John Mark.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.980]   John Mark was not an eyewitness to the things that he wrote.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.680]   He actually got his accounts of what we're reading from Peter.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.800]   He was a disciple of Peter.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.720]   If you're not familiar with the Bible, Jesus had 12 really close friends.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.960]   But there were three of those 12 friends that he spent extra time with and their names were
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.680]   Peter, James, and John.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.640]   Peter was one of the people who was closest to Jesus.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:36.000]   A lot of people in the early church, the first century church, viewed Mark's gospel as Peter's
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   memoirs.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.440]   And so John Mark is learning from Peter's eyewitness accounts.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.680]   John Mark wrote this book to portray the person and mission of Jesus Christ for roaming Christians
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.340]   undergoing persecution under Nero.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.280]   So I would imagine that they felt stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.000]   And so it's helpful for these Christians who are undergoing persecution from Nero to hear
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.280]   a story about Jesus calming a storm.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.800]   So let's pick it back up.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.320]   We just read it, but listen to it again.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.520]   It sets the scene for us.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.760]   Verse 35 of Mark 4, it says, "On that day, when evening had come, he," that's Jesus,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.520]   "said to them, 'Let us go across to the other side.'
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.780]   And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.860]   And other boats were with him, and a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:40.240]   into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.800]   But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.040]   And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.640]   I love this.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.800]   I love this passage so much.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.120]   So I just want you to get what is happening here.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   Okay?
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.280]   So you got Jesus and his friends, they begin to go across the Sea of Galilee.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.560]   What you need to understand is that the Sea of Galilee is situated at about 700 feet below
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.760]   sea level, and it's surrounded by hills.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:16.360]   The Sea of Galilee, I've been on it before, it is known for sudden and violent storms.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.800]   Jesus and his friends find themselves in one of these sudden and violent storms.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.040]   What's interesting, though, is to think about who is on the boat with Jesus.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.380]   If you're familiar with the Bible, and you're familiar with what the occupations were of
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:38.080]   several of Jesus' friends, what was their occupation?
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   They were fishermen.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.620]   At least four of them were fishermen, which means the Sea of Galilee had been their office.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.600]   These were boat guys.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.560]   And yet these guys who officed on the Sea of Galilee find themselves in a storm that
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.220]   has them freaking out.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.160]   Which I find really interesting.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.300]   Like I believe that this was the worst storm they had ever experienced in their life, because
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:08.380]   we don't see even the professional fishermen saying, "Hey guys, we've been here before.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.380]   You do this.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.380]   You sit here.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.440]   We're going to make it.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.440]   Don't freak out.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.980]   This is just what happens on the Sea of Galilee."
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.780]   No, the professional fisherman is like, "This is it!
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.300]   This is it!
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.580]   We are going to die!"
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.180]   And as water fills the boat, stress fills their souls.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.560]   Why?
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.160]   Because they're no longer in control.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.760]   Which shows us the very first truth that we need to understand about stress.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.780]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.920]   You realize that, right?
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.700]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.340]   Just think right now what you can't control.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.140]   You can't control the outcome of the election tonight.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.900]   You can't control how much free time you have.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.160]   You can't manufacture a 30-hour workday.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.320]   You can't control whether you're going to get that raise or not.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.920]   You can't control chronic pain.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.600]   You can't control your loved one's health.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.560]   You can't control it.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.600]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.240]   So that's where we have to start.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.700]   Now if that is true, if at the root of your stress is a lack of control, you're going
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   to love the second truth I have for you.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.540]   Okay, here's the second truth.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:36.100]   God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.700]   No one's saying amen to that.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.940]   Like that's just...
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.620]   Isn't that great news?
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.900]   At the root of your stress is a lack of control.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.300]   And great news, God will intentionally lead you into situations you cannot control.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.780]   Do you remember whose idea it was to go across to the other side of the Sea of Galilee?
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.780]   Whose was it?
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.340]   It was Jesus's.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.800]   Jesus was and is God, which means Jesus knew that he was inviting his friends to cross
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:11.620]   the sea at the exact same time as an "I think we are going to die" type of storm was going
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.160]   to be brewing.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.980]   So I have to believe that Jesus intentionally led them into the storm.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:26.800]   And if you were to go and read this book, you would see that that's what God has a tendency
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.900]   of doing.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.980]   He consistently leads his people into situations that they cannot control.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.900]   Think about Joseph in the book of Genesis.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.940]   He's thrown into a well and sold into slavery by his brothers.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:48.220]   The nation of Israel was busted out of Egypt and led by Moses, but where did Moses lead
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.220]   them?
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.140]   To a dead end at the Red Sea.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.820]   Daniel was thrown into a lion's den.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:00.440]   Zachariah and Elizabeth were old, wrinkly, and barren.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.140]   This is what God does.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.680]   He will intentionally lead him...
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:12.100]   He will intentionally lead his people into situations that they cannot control.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:22.080]   The problem with that is that we love control.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.760]   Like some of you guys are budding control freaks.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.200]   Some of you guys are in full bloom.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.400]   Like you know who you are.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   You're like, "Yeah, that's me."
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.220]   I love control.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:38.960]   You want to have every single aspect of your life under control.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.480]   Hair has to be perfect.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.240]   Clothes have to be perfect.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.520]   Weight on the scale has to be perfect.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.360]   Organization on the desk, perfect.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.800]   Your day has to go exactly how you planned.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.520]   You need everything under control.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   And if you're one of those people who needs every single aspect of your life under control,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.120]   you know what your life is going to feel like?
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.840]   Some of you all have heard me share this before.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.740]   It's going to feel like trying to carry a big pile of laundry.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:13.620]   Like you go to the dryer, you open up the door, and like we're busy people, right?
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.420]   So we only have time for one trip from the dryer to the couch or to wherever you're taking
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.580]   your laundry, right?
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:27.540]   So you reach in there, you scrape the insides of the dryer until you really...
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.820]   Like something in your mind clicks like, "Yep, I got it all.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.860]   I have every article of clothing in my grasp."
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.660]   And then you begin to make the walk.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.380]   And as you're making the walk, like you just...
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:49.400]   Something triggers inside like, "Hey, just look back."
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.300]   And when you look back, what do you see?
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.620]   Man down.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.580]   Sock down.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:04.380]   Now this is where we display our brilliance because instead of taking that pile of laundry,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.940]   dropping it off and coming back, no, we're busy.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.700]   And we developed this very noble and heroic mantra of no sock left behind.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:22.180]   And so we back up to the sock and we try and balance the entire pile on one hand as if
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.860]   we were crushing it with two hands.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.140]   And just when you get that sock, what do you see?
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.340]   Whitey tighties down.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.620]   And shame on you for never switching to boxers.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.740]   What are you doing with your life?
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.260]   But like this...
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.700]   Look, if you need to have everything in control of your life, this is going to be your reality.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.500]   Like you're going to feel like, "Man, I'm crushing life one day and then the financial
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.540]   sock's going to fall."
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.180]   And just when you feel like, "Man, you get that back under control," you know what?
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.940]   There goes your relationship status.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.180]   And just when you get that back in control, okay, here comes your parents' divorce.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:06.780]   And like it's just one thing after another where you want control and you can't have
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.100]   it.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.980]   And I think it begs the question, like if Jesus loves us, why does he lead us into situations
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.420]   we can't control?
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.760]   It feels unloving.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.660]   And I'll answer that before we're done.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.460]   The third key truth that I want you to know is this, you don't have to be in control because
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.660]   Jesus already is.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.700]   And we sang about that tonight.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.780]   Here's the great news on the night of the 2024 election, you don't have to be in control
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.500]   because Jesus already is.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.260]   Your candidate doesn't have to win because Jesus Christ already reigns, which is really
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.260]   good news.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.580]   But you don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.780]   Watch how things play out for the disciples.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.980]   Look back at the text.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.680]   Verse chapter 4, verse 39.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:08.420]   It says, "And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Peace be still.'
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.740]   And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.260]   He said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.780]   Have you still no faith?'
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:25.580]   And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.740]   the wind and the sea obey him?'"
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.340]   This is amazing.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:37.600]   Like they come to him, and I love their question.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.860]   Their question is what?
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.780]   Do you not care that we're perishing?
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.060]   That's how real the Bible is.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.500]   Like they are coming up to God in the flesh, they're like, "You don't even care."
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.980]   And Jesus wakes up and what does he do?
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.020]   He begins to speak to the storm.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.060]   And what are the words that come out of his mouth?
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.220]   "Peace be still."
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.000]   Now this is where you have to learn to see the scriptures.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.020]   You have to start putting yourself into the story.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.300]   Because sometimes we get the wrong picture of Jesus, like he's groggy, just woke up from
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.500]   a nap and he's like, "Oh man, peace.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   Peace be still."
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:25.860]   No, I didn't know that was what was going to come out.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.340]   Like you never know sometimes up here.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.460]   When he says, "Peace be still," he uses the Greek word, "Themao."
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.980]   Themao is the same word he used back in chapter one of Mark when he cast out a demon.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.120]   You know what it means?
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.300]   It literally means to muzzle.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.940]   So don't imagine saying, "Peace be still."
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.540]   Imagine him saying, "Shut up.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.940]   Be quiet."
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.060]   It's like putting a muzzle on an unruly dog.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:04.940]   Like when I read this, I thought of this TV show that used to be on.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.300]   It was probably long before y'all's time, but it was called The Dog Whisperer.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.220]   And The Dog Whisperer was this show about this world-renowned dog trainer named Caesar
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.700]   Milan.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:22.260]   And the way the show would go is that it would open with like this montage of clips of like
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.660]   an unruly dog.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:30.820]   The dog would be like barking and biting his owner and like eating an entire couch in one
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.820]   sitting.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:37.080]   And then Caesar would show up, knock on the door, the dog would come up, and Caesar would
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:42.460]   just look at the dog and go, "Hey.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.700]   Hey."
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.940]   And the dog would like stop what it was doing, like do the head tilt and fall over and die.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.700]   It was crazy.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.640]   It was crazy.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.740]   But I read this and I'm like, yeah, Jesus is the sea whisperer.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.660]   Like he, Jesus just steps in and he's like, "Hey.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   Be quiet.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.660]   Be silent.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.660]   Peace.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.660]   Shut up.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.660]   Put a muzzle on it."
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:20.900]   And in a moment in time, the sea goes from chaotic to calm.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.020]   What if the great calm of the sea could be the great calm of the soul?
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.940]   You know what I love is that everyone on the boat is freaking out.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.260]   But did you see the word "but" in verse 38?
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:43.740]   That word, when you learn Bible study methods, people tell you to look out for the "but"
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.640]   because the "but" marks a contrast.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.900]   So if I'm studying the scripture, I want to put a box around that because it's something
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.320]   that you want to highlight.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.500]   You want to zero in on because what the author of the text is trying to show you is that
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:09.260]   what's coming after the word "but" is very different than what came before it.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.580]   What comes after the "but"?
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:17.340]   But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.380]   Everyone's freaking out.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.020]   Jesus is asleep.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.980]   How was he able to sleep through the storm?
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.640]   Because he wasn't threatened by the storm.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.580]   Those waters had been made by God simply speaking.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.040]   Surely they could be calmed in the exact same way.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.820]   And I believe that tonight is an invitation, whether it's the election that's causing you
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.500]   stress or one of the other many things that I mentioned, but I believe that God is inviting
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.060]   many of us and just saying, "Hey, look, the great calm of the sea can be the great calm
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   of the soul.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.740]   Like, he wants to speak peace into your life tonight."
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.980]   And you know what the good news is?
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.380]   Is that, you know what, that can sound really nice and flowery.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.940]   It's like, "Okay, TAs, this guest speaker is just saying, 'Oh, just be at peace.'
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.980]   But that sounds really good in this room."
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.820]   But then when you leave, it's like, "I don't even know what that looks like."
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.100]   You know what the good news is, is that the Apostle Paul tells us the way.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.420]   Listen to what he says in Philippians 4, 6 through 7.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.740]   He says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.500]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:42.060]   And watch this, "In the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.900]   hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.620]   So let's just unpack that real quick.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.780]   So he says, "Do not be anxious about anything."
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.420]   So that is a command from God through Paul to us.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.140]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.780]   Do you know what anything means in the Greek?
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.180]   Anything.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   That's what it means.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.100]   It means anything.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.660]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.740]   And like, at least in my Bible, and you can check yours, but at least in my Bible, next
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.760]   to the word anything, there's not an asterisk that points me to a footnote at the bottom
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.520]   of the text, like giving me caveats.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.900]   Do not be anxious about anything, except at the 2024 election when you've only got two
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.660]   options, Harris or Trump.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.580]   Do not be anxious about anything, except when your relationship status feels like it is
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.580]   falling apart.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.940]   Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you haven't lived up
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.300]   to your expectations and life just isn't what you thought it would be at the age of 28.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.740]   Do not be anxious about it.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:53.420]   No, do not be anxious about anything.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.420]   But then he goes on.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.460]   And what does he say?
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.780]   Not in everything.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   Everything means everything.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.940]   In everything.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.940]   By prayer in supplication.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:07.940]   So what's his point?
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.300]   Like, if something's stressing you out, God wants to hear about it.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.000]   Whatever's stressing you out right now, have you talked to God about it?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   What I'm not asking you is have you talked at God about it?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.700]   I'm asking you if you have invited Him in.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.300]   Sometimes we want to talk at God about what's stressing us out, but we want to keep it,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.180]   we want to keep the ball in our court.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.700]   Like we really don't want to give it over to Him.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.460]   We keep trying to control and manage.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.940]   So what I'm asking you is have you invited Him in?
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:49.000]   Paul says, by prayer and supplication, and then watch this word.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.140]   He says, with thanksgiving.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:59.580]   Now this is where I feel like my tendency is to think that Paul messed up and erasers
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.420]   didn't exist back then.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:07.180]   He's like, okay, you're stressed out, you're anxious, but don't be anxious, and you've
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.860]   got to pray about it.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.540]   And then thanksgiving, oh shoot, no, you don't thank God yet.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.980]   He hasn't done anything about it.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.420]   You save that to the end.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:24.340]   Now, our tendency is to think that the order of things is something happens, we stress
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:33.100]   out, we pray, God does something about it, and then we say thank you.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.260]   Paul's like, no, that's not how it works.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.700]   Something happens, you start stressing out, you start praying about it, and you start
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.860]   thanking God right in the midst of the uncertainty.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.980]   Have you ever tried that?
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.860]   Have you ever stopped in the midst of the stress and started thanking God for what He's
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.140]   done in the past?
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.660]   Because when you remember that God's been faithful, it reminds you that He's capable.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.540]   He's been faithful in the past, He's capable with your present.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.540]   So try that.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.260]   Just start looking back and thanking God for what He's already done.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.200]   But I also want to encourage you to try thanking God for what He will do.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.700]   Have you ever tried that?
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.660]   God, I thank you in advance for what you're going to do.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.940]   Now what I'm not talking about right now is like a name it and claim it thing, like that
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.020]   if you just pray and ask God for it, and you ask Him for $10,000 tomorrow, it's just going
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.300]   to show up in your mailbox.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.540]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.500]   Thank you God that you're going to give me a new car this week.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   Thank you God.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.260]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.780]   I'm just saying you put your confidence in God, thank you.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.420]   God, I'm going to make it this week because you're in control of my life.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.380]   I don't know how you're going to figure this out.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.380]   I don't know what you're going to do, but I do know that you're in control.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.900]   You're before all things and in you all things hold together.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.140]   So I'm grateful because I'm safe in your hands.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.680]   And I can't see a way out, but just because I can't doesn't mean you can't.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.780]   And so I trust you.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.340]   Thank Him for what He will do.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.220]   Let your requests be made known to God, watch this, in the peace of God which surpasses
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.860]   all understanding will.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.380]   That's a promise from God through Paul to you.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:22.340]   It doesn't say that it might guard your hearts and your minds, it says that it will guard
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:29.140]   your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.340]   You want to know what stress ultimately is?
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.620]   Stress is simply a distress signal from your soul that you're looking inward instead of
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.420]   upward.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.260]   You're looking to yourself for the solution.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.740]   You're looking for control that you don't have.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.900]   Paul's point is, "Hey, stop looking inward, start looking upward."
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.140]   You have been made to look upward.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:00.400]   Put your trust in Him.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.100]   The fourth truth that I need you to know tonight is this.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:08.540]   When you can't control life, you have two options, fear or faith.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.900]   Those are your two options, fear or faith.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.580]   The normal and natural response to a lack of control is fear.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.220]   That's what stress is.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.200]   It's when you don't have control, when you can't see the outcome, you can't see how something's
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.700]   going to turn out, and it causes fear.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.700]   That's what stress is.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:33.500]   It's fear of the unknown.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.340]   Fear was the disciples' response.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.180]   We know that because Jesus asked them, "Why are you afraid?"
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.580]   But look at what else He says.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.140]   Look back at the text.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.660]   Verse 40, "Why are you so afraid?
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.260]   Have you still no faith?"
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.980]   So Jesus' point is, "Hey, you actually had two options.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:58.660]   You chose fear, but you had the option of faith."
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.220]   Why did they have that option?
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:08.140]   Because Jesus, the one who calms storms, was in the boat.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.740]   And so His point was, "You chose fear when you had the option of faith, because the one
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:17.620]   who just has to say the word was in the boat."
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:23.340]   Maybe God brought you here tonight so that you could simply hear that stress isn't inevitable,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   is optional.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.500]   You do have a choice.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   Why?
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.540]   Because Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, the one who just has to say the word, is in
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.940]   the boat of your life, and He cares.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.500]   And He's passionate about your peace.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.820]   If you ever question if God cares about your peace, all you have to do is look at the cross
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:47.980]   of Jesus Christ, because the cross is a message of peace.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.940]   Colossians 119 says this, "For in Him," that's in Jesus, "all the fullness of God was pleased
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:35:01.140]   to dwell in, through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:05.460]   making peace by the blood of His cross."
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.020]   So just listen to this.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:12.700]   Jesus died, was buried, and rose from the dead so that we could experience peace.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:19.260]   On the cross, Jesus Christ was crucified, punished for your sins and mine, and when
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:27.380]   He declared on the cross, "It is finished," it was the same thing as Jesus saying, "Shut
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.940]   up to the storm."
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:35.220]   Because when He declared, "It is finished," that was His way of saying, "Be quiet to a
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:41.500]   different storm, the storm of sin that threatened to separate you and me from Him for all of
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   eternity."
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.580]   He has gone to the cross and He has conquered the grave, making peace.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.500]   So if you're, if this is your first time at the porch, if you don't know anything about
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.340]   Christianity, then I want to make sure you hear what I'm saying.
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.580]   Our message tonight isn't, "Do better, try harder."
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.420]   It's, "Hey, there's peace available with the God of the universe."
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.120]   Like you can leave tonight having peace with your Maker.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.660]   Like you don't have to wait, you don't have to wonder, lay awake on those nights where
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.560]   it's just you and your thoughts and wonder, "Like if I were to die tonight, like what's
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   going to happen?"
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.980]   Like if I stand before God and He looks at me and says, "Why do you deserve to be in
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   heaven?"
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.780]   Like you don't have to wonder.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.480]   Jesus Christ came to make peace between you and God.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.100]   He takes all of your sin and He gives you all of His righteousness.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.180]   So that when the God of the universe looks at you, you know what He sees through faith
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.500]   in Christ?
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:54.460]   He sees the righteousness of Jesus Christ, His Son, which is incredible.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:37:03.260]   You can have peace with God tonight, but the only way it comes is through faith.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.460]   It's inviting Christ into your life.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.300]   It's giving your life to Jesus and just saying, "Jesus, I don't want to do life without You
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.440]   anymore."
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.060]   Like if you're the one and only one who can make peace with God, I want You.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:24.340]   I want You to be the King of my life.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.660]   Jesus cares about your peace.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.380]   And if you ever question if God is in control, all you have to do is look at the empty tomb
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:36.440]   because that's where Jesus Christ took His life back from the grave.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:43.100]   That's why Jesus can say in Revelation chapter 1 that He holds the keys to death and Hades.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:48.960]   He is sovereign and in control of all things.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.900]   So it kind of brings us to this question, like if Jesus loves us, then why would He
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.460]   lead us into situations that we can't control?
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.540]   Here's the simple answer.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:06.580]   It gives Him an opportunity to show up in your life.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:12.100]   The worst thing that He could ever do for you is let you go your whole life thinking
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:19.480]   that you are self-sufficient, to let you get to the end of your life and stand before God
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:28.460]   and realize that without a Savior, you have nothing.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:34.360]   What if Jesus loves us so much to know that there's more joy waiting for us in dependence
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.960]   upon Him than in control of our own lives?
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.280]   What if He cares so much about our joy that He invites us into situations where we have
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.660]   no choice but to depend on Him?
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.660]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.080]   I said that you have two choices, fear or faith.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:39:02.600]   But I want you to look back at the wording of verse 41.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.920]   What's their response when Jesus calms the storm?
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.520]   It says, "And they were filled with great fear."
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.800]   You would think it would say, "And they were filled with great faith."
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.360]   Jesus says, "Why are you afraid?
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.600]   Have you still no faith?"
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.960]   They should be filled with faith now, but it says, "Jesus said, 'Why are you so afraid?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   Have you still no faith?'
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.200]   And they were filled with great fear."
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   That feels off.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.920]   It's a different type of fear.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.880]   You know what faith is?
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.320]   Faith is choosing not to fear your circumstances because you fear the one who's in control
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   of your circumstances.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.760]   See, it's a different type of fear.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.120]   It's a fear driven by faith.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.500]   It's not the opposite of faith.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.920]   It's the product of faith.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:53.400]   It's believing that the one who's in control of your life, the one who's in the boat of
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:00.480]   your life, is in control and can give peace.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.440]   I'll close by just showing you one more thing in the Scriptures.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.640]   So years ago I was just battling some stress and anxiety in my life and so I went to see
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.080]   a biblical counselor.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.200]   A biblical counselor is just someone who opens up the Bible, listens to what's going on in
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.720]   your life, and then shares Scripture with you to encourage you with it.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.520]   And so I sit with him, I share with him what's causing me stress, and guess where he takes
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.840]   me in the Bible?
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   Mark chapter 4.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.080]   So he opens up Mark chapter 4, tells me his story about Jesus coming to the storm.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   I'm like, "That's so great.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   Thank you so much.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.960]   I paid a lot of money just for you to show me that story."
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.480]   Okay, that's great.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.300]   But before our session was over, this is the thing that I remember.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.800]   Before that session was over, he just said, "Hey man, you have to see Acts chapter 12."
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.520]   I was like, "Man, what's Acts chapter 12?"
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.280]   And he had me turn over to Acts chapter 12, which is a story about Peter.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.000]   Peter was one of the guys in the boat.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.320]   Now what's interesting is we don't know who ran to Jesus and said, "Do you not care that
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.160]   we're perishing?"
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.840]   But if you know anything about Peter, it sounds like something he would say.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.240]   We don't know for sure.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.520]   Peter was a speak first, think second kind of guy.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:26.200]   But we do know that that question articulates what everyone in the boat was thinking.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.840]   Do you not care?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.040]   And so this is amazing.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.040]   Turn to Acts chapter 12.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.240]   It's a story about Peter.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:41.400]   King Herod has just put James to death.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:49.360]   And he sees that people are so excited that he put James to death that he arrests Peter.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:55.640]   And what the text kind of leads us to believe is on that night, like Herod plans to put
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.860]   Peter to death.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:06.020]   So here Peter is on another night with a different storm where his life is on the line.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.540]   But listen to what Peter is doing.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.540]   This is amazing.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.540]   Watch this.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.820]   Now when Herod was about to bring him out on that very night, what's Peter doing?
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:17.460]   Peter was sleeping.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.460]   Between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries before the doors were guarding
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   the prison.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.940]   Behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him and a light shone in the cell.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.540]   He struck Peter on the side and welcomed saying, "Get up quickly."
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.620]   And the chains fell off his hands.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.940]   So just think about this.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.460]   Follow me on this.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:39.300]   Peter's on the boat, runs to Jesus and what's Jesus doing?
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.740]   He's sleeping.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.300]   What's Peter's question?
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.500]   Or one of their questions.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.180]   Do you not care that we're perishing?
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:52.060]   Jesus gets up, calms the storm, goes to the cross, conquers the grave, comes to Peter,
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.500]   looks at Peter and says to him in John 21, "You follow me."
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:02.300]   And Peter took him so seriously that on another night with another storm where his life is
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.660]   on the line, you know what he does?
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.260]   He's like, "I know exactly what to do.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.340]   I go to sleep."
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.540]   He said to follow me.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.780]   I know what to do when storms in life come.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.060]   I sleep peacefully.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.260]   And he's sleeping so peacefully that an angel shows up and it's not enough.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.260]   Did you see the text?
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.900]   Like the angel comes in, light shines, he's still asleep.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.700]   The angel has to strike him to wake him.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.700]   It's amazing.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.260]   It's like, "Dude, get up.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   I'm an angel.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.340]   You should be up by now."
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:38.500]   And so it's just a good, it's instructive.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:44.700]   Like if sleeping peacefully when death is knocking at the door is the goal, then can't
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:49.740]   we all agree that we probably all have some room to grow?
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.940]   Like tonight are you going to sleep peacefully?
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.940]   Like whenever you find out who wins this election, are you going to be able to sleep at night?
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.780]   Like what's going to keep you up tonight?
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:08.500]   And will you lay down and go to sleep knowing that the Prince of Peace, the one who just
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:14.340]   has to say the word is in the boat of your life and he cares?
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:22.020]   Let's pray together.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:29.660]   I just want to invite you right now, look, here's what we're going to do.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.780]   We're going to have people up front who are available and ready to pray with you.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.940]   So if it would be helpful to you to talk to someone or have someone pray with you over
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.380]   what's stressing you out, you can totally do that.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:50.020]   We're going to sing in just a minute, but if you need to kind of ask your friend to
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.880]   pray over you, to put a hand on you and pray over you and whatever's stressing you out,
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   you should do that.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.100]   You don't have to rush out of this place.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:06.100]   You can sit here and do business with the Lord and just wait on Him to bring peace into
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.180]   your life for whatever it is.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:13.220]   If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus and you're realizing
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:19.860]   for the first time that Jesus Christ wants to give you peace with God, then I want to
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.820]   encourage you right now just to invite Christ into your life.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.820]   So pray with me.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:29.020]   Just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.300]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.800]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.860]   Would you come into my life?
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:44.540]   Would you forgive me of all of my sins?
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.100]   Would you make me at peace with God?
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:55.100]   And would you lead me in a new life?"
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.820]   If you just received Christ into your life, my encouragement to you is to tell someone
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.820]   tonight.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:07.000]   And for everyone else here, this is just time for you to, maybe you need to sing in response
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.540]   to declare that you trust Jesus.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.700]   Maybe you need to sit and pray.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   Whatever you need to do, if you need to come up and have someone pray for you, this is
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.380]   the time for you to respond to God.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.060]   We need you and we love you.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.020]   In Jesus' name, amen.
