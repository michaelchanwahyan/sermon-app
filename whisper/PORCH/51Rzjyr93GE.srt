1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:25,800
 - All right, well, welcome everybody in the room,

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,460
 everybody tuning in online,

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,120
 Ports Austin, Ports Boise, Ports Tulsa,

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,000
 Ports North Houston, Ports Scottsdale,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,500
 all the different Ports lot locations,

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,200
 we're continuing this series on God,

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 where we are looking at stories from the book of Daniel.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,600
 Let me start by giving a little vision into my world.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,020
 In December, my wife and I moved our two oldest kids,

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,860
 our son and daughter, into the same room,

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,320
 put them in a bunk bed, here's a picture of them,

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
 just chilling, loving life,

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,980
 can't believe we get to sleep together,

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,940
 got my princess cup and everything,

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,980
 and it was awesome, we combined bedtimes,

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,540
 which allowed you to put them both down at the same time,

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,480
 but shortly after, they began staying in the same room,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,660
 my son, the boy on top,

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,820
 started having what's called night terrors.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,020
 Now just a heads up, someday you may have kids,

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,060
 this is not a nightmare, this is a night terror.

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,900
 What's the difference?

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,360
 A night terror happens about 45 minutes after you go to bed,

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,520
 nightmare happens sometime in the middle of the night,

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,840
 I don't know, I don't make this stuff up,

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,680
 but anyways, he begins to have these night terrors,

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,640
 and we begin to try to figure out what's happening,

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,540
 like a night terror where he would just wake up,

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,260
 and it's not like just a nightmare where you wake up

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,240
 and you're like still in the sleep mode,

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,440
 so he's screaming, which means he's waking up his sister

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,680
 every single night, just some form of torture,

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,060
 45 minutes into falling asleep,

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,560
 and my wife and I begin to go, what is causing this?

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,740
 Is it something he ate?

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,680
 Is it because at first we thought it was,

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
 we watched The Lion King,

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,280
 I knew I should have fast forwarded on a part with Scar,

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,700
 and he's having night terrors now,

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,440
 and then eventually we begin to go,

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,900
 man, is it something he's eating?

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,200
 Is it the time, maybe we should wake him up 45 minutes in,

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,360
 and then that'll avoid it.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,280
 Nope, it just delayed the night terror from happening,

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,120
 so we begin to just look for solutions,

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,840
 we're trying essential oils and rubbing it on things,

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,500
 and just, you know, that's who we are,

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,200
 and eventually, my wife took him to the dentist,

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,800
 and he was having his first dental appointment,

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
 or one of his first dental appointments,

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
 and the dentist looked in his mouth and said,

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
 his tonsils are really large, is he having night terrors?

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,480
 And it turns out that if you have tonsils that are large,

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,400
 at night it can inhibit your breathing,

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,320
 which for whatever reason has some impact,

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
 and creates night terrors.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
 And so today, now he goes to bed,

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,240
 and he has like this nasal saline spray

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
 that he has to put in there every single time

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
 that he goes to bed, but it gave him some relief.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now what does that have to do

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,560
 with what we're gonna talk about tonight?

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,560
 We're gonna look at a man who is having a night terror,

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,280
 if you will, and it's a king named Nebuchadnezzar

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,000
 that we launched into last week,

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,360
 and Nebuchadnezzar begins to have this nightmare,

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
 this thing that is reoccurring,

69
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
 and keeps him from being able to sleep.

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,960
 And Daniel, who's the focal point really of tonight,

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,720
 and for much of the study on God,

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
 is gonna interpret the dream,

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
 and the interpretation of the dream

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,160
 provides the relief the king was looking for.

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 But in Daniel's interpretation,

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,140
 and even the way that he goes before the king,

77
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,500
 and communicates the meaning of his dream,

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,720
 we learn a lot of things

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
 that we're just gonna walk through and observe.

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,300
 One of the things that we learn

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 is how Daniel could be so confident standing before the king.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,660
 And so we're gonna explore and continue this series,

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,320
 and learn what was at the root and behind

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,200
 why Daniel was so confident in the chaos.

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
 As we said last week,

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,480
 on God is looking at the book of Daniel.

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,320
 What's the book of Daniel?

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,400
 It's a book that was written 600 years ago

89
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,820
 in a town, or in this capital city of Babylon.

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,320
 Babylonian Empire was the world superpower in 600 BC.

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,680
 It had conquered the known world,

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,040
 and it was ruled by a ruthless dictator named Nebuchadnezzar.

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
 Here's a picture of the map of Babylon.

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
 No, that's Zac Efron.

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,200
 And there's Babylon.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
 We just have pictures of Zac Efron around.

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 There's Babylon, and you can see

98
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,720
 that's the Babylonian Empire.

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,280
 And the reason they had Zac Efron

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
 is whenever I read through scripture,

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 I'll think of the different characters that are involved,

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,160
 so when I think of Daniel, like I said last week,

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
 I think of Zac Efron.

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,320
 When I think of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

105
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,120
 we think of the Spider-Man trio.

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,060
 When I think of King Nebuchadnezzar, this kind of evil king,

107
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,760
 I think either Jafar or the king from Gladiator,

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,400
 but those are kind of the characters.

109
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,640
 And Nebuchadnezzar rules the known world.

110
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,360
 He's taken captive Daniel and his friends,

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,800
 and Daniel is put to work in the king's palace.

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
 And the king's gonna have a dream,

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,800
 and Daniel's interaction and exchange

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
 and interpretation of the dream

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,500
 gives us a look into how he was so confident,

116
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,560
 and it also tells us the entire story of history.

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,520
 He tells a dream that, candidly,

118
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,400
 I don't know that I'll be able to put into words

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,160
 the power that this chapter has had since it was written,

120
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
 because Daniel is gonna say to the king

121
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,040
 the events that happened immediately

122
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,400
 in the centuries following,

123
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,040
 and that will happen all the way up

124
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
 until the Messiah's return.

125
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,360
 So we're gonna be in Daniel chapter two,

126
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
 starting in verse one.

127
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,480
 We're gonna walk through three observations.

128
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
 If you have a Bible, you can flip there now.

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,760
 If not, it'll be on the screen.

130
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,280
 And as always, we have Bibles in the Welcome Center

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
 that are our gift to you.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
 So let me start in verse one.

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:06,520
 One night, during the second year of his reign,

134
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,440
 King Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams

135
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,360
 he could not sleep.

136
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 So he called his magicians, enchanters,

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
 sorcerers, astrologers, anyone who had access to the divine,

138
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,460
 and he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed.

139
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,040
 As they stood before the king, he said,

140
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,960
 "I've had a dream.

141
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,020
 "It deeply troubles me.

142
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,320
 "I must know what it means."

143
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,460
 The astrologers answered.

144
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,480
 The king, an Aramaic, long lived the king.

145
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,080
 "Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means."

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
 But the king said to them,

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 "I am serious if you don't tell me what my dream was

148
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,260
 "and what it means, I will have you torn limb from limb

149
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,200
 "and your houses turned into heaps of rubble."

150
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
 That escalated quickly.

151
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,240
 Nebuchadnezzar was known to have a temper,

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,260
 so he calls in his guys to say, "Hey, I've had a dream,

153
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,800
 "and I want you to tell me what it was and what it means."

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
 Some people believe it's because,

155
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,960
 like often happens when you have a dream,

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,680
 you wake up and you're like, "Wait, what was that?

157
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,560
 "And was she there?"

158
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
 And you can vaguely remember it,

159
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,280
 and you're like, "I don't think he had pants on."

160
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,120
 And it's just kind of you're piecing together,

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,720
 maybe it was that, or maybe he just wanted to see

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
 if these men actually possessed

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,720
 the divine wisdom they claimed to.

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,060
 The men say back to him,

165
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,200
 "Nobody can do what you're asking, that's impossible."

166
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,300
 In verse 10, "No one on earth can tell a king his dream.

167
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,440
 "No king has ever asked of any person such a thing.

168
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,000
 "The king's demand," verse 11, "is impossible."

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
 He can't tell you your dream.

170
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,400
 "No one except the gods can tell you your dream,

171
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,860
 "and they do not live here among people.

172
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,200
 "The king was furious, and he ordered all the wise men

173
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,240
 "to be executed, which included Daniel,

174
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,400
 "and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

175
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,640
 "When Arioch, the king's commander, came to kill them,"

176
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,420
 that's a bad day, I'm here to kill you,

177
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,580
 "Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion,

178
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,260
 "and he asked Arioch,

179
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,340
 "'Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?'

180
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,900
 "Arioch explained everything that happened.

181
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,460
 "Daniel went to see the king.

182
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,260
 "He asked for more time to tell the king

183
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,280
 "what the dream meant.

184
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,100
 "And then Daniel went home, and he told his friends,

185
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,600
 "Hananiah, Meshach, and Azariah,"

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,640
 that's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

187
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,620
 "what had happened.

188
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,560
 "He urged them to ask the God of heaven

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 "to show them his mercy by telling him the secret,

190
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,080
 "so they would not be executed

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
 "along with the other wise men of Babylon."

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,560
 The first thing I wanna point out

193
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,960
 that we see from Nebuchadnezzar

194
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,480
 and his reason why Daniel had such confidence

195
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,480
 before the king is he knew what Nebuchadnezzar's life

196
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,500
 reflects, everyone needs God.

197
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,320
 The king, Nebuchadnezzar, was the most powerful person

198
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,440
 who had ever ruled to that point.

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,840
 He had created a civilization,

200
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,980
 even his own palace and the city of Babylon

201
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,680
 was constructed in a way

202
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,220
 that he constantly lived in security.

203
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,060
 I mean, it was a marvel.

204
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,960
 The city itself was one of the wonders of the ancient world.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,480
 It had walls 75 feet high and thick enough

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
 for two four-horse chariots to ride across,

207
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,940
 a Greek historian tells us, that it was a marvel.

208
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,920
 He lived in luxury, he lived in security, he had more gold.

209
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
 One historian said Babylon contained more gold than dust,

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
 that he was the wealthiest, richest, securest,

211
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,840
 he had everything you'd want, and yet he had a need,

212
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,920
 and that need was God.

213
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
 And Daniel knew that I offer something of the king

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
 that he doesn't have,

215
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,600
 something that every person who's ever lived needs,

216
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,640
 which is a relationship with God in this life,

217
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,280
 a relationship with God to have eternal life.

218
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
 And the same is true today.

219
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,720
 Every person you've ever met,

220
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,960
 and you probably have never thought about it this way before

221
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,560
 but every person needs God.

222
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,240
 They may not even realize their need for God,

223
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,360
 but the greatest whole that exists inside

224
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,760
 of every human heart is a hole that only God can fill.

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,520
 Your boss at work today, as much of a jerk as he is,

226
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,820
 is in need of God.

227
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,080
 Your parents, and however great or poorly you think of them,

228
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,360
 are in need of a relationship with God.

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,640
 Billionaires, supermodels, baristas,

230
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,200
 all come into existence and have and share in common

231
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,040
 a need for God in this life and for eternal life.

232
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,100
 There's an emptiness that ultimately only God can satisfy.

233
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,080
 Tom Brady a couple weeks ago decided

234
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,200
 that he was gonna do another fake out

235
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
 and come back to play again for the 700th year.

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,960
 And you think about that.

237
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,280
 And my wife and I were talking about it, and who knows?

238
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,200
 It's like, man, you just can't let it go.

239
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
 And the reasons behind that, who knows?

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
 I do know he did an interview a handful of years ago,

241
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,220
 and it was with 60 Minutes,

242
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,400
 and the interview may give us the reason why

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,240
 it's hard to let it go.

244
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,940
 In the interview, he says this, this is Tom Brady speaking.

245
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,260
 "There's times I'm not the person I wanna be.

246
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,940
 "Why do I have three Super Bowl rings

247
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,680
 "and still think there's something greater

248
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,560
 "out there for me?"

249
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,760
 I mean, maybe a lot of people would say,

250
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,800
 "Hey, man, this is it.

251
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,560
 "I reached my goal, my dream, my life.

252
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,560
 "Me, I think, God, it's gotta be more than this.

253
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,680
 "I mean, this can't be what it's all cracked up to be."

254
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
 And the interviewer asked him, "What's the answer?"

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,720
 And what he responds with is tragic.

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,480
 "What's the answer?"

257
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,060
 Tom Brady responds, "I wish I knew.

258
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,840
 "I wish I knew."

259
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,400
 Now, what's he reflecting?

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
 He's reflecting what's true about every person

261
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,020
 you've ever met and ever will meet,

262
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,040
 that there is a hole inside of the human heart.

263
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,260
 God says in Ecclesiastes chapter three

264
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,520
 that he put it there so that you and I would encounter him,

265
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,040
 that everyone has a need for God.

266
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
 And some of you came to the room tonight,

267
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
 and you don't think you need God.

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,640
 You feel like you're living your life.

269
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,920
 You got, everything on the outside looks picturesque.

270
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,120
 Everything looks like what everyone else would want.

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,880
 And yet you know it's empty.

272
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,800
 And you'll either discover that today

273
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,600
 or discover your need eventually,

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,780
 because every person has a desperate need

275
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,300
 inside of the human heart for God,

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,000
 just like the king had a desperate need

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,240
 for an answer from the divine.

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,020
 And Daniel is able to go confidently

279
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,760
 because he knows that I offer and I have something

280
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,800
 that every person needs, and he doesn't.

281
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,640
 How?

282
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
 There was a writer for the London Times,

283
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,920
 which is basically the New York Times version

284
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,480
 of the Times, it's actually called in London.

285
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,960
 And he was reflecting on some time

286
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,440
 that he'd spent in Africa, and he says something,

287
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,460
 despite being an atheist, that really reflects

288
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,760
 what's true not just of Africa,

289
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,620
 but of all places in general.

290
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,460
 Here's what it says.

291
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,920
 This is Matthew Paris for the London Times.

292
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,440
 And he writes about what he observed

293
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,560
 in his time in Malawi.

294
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
 He says, "As an atheist,

295
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,480
 "I truly believe Africa needs God.

296
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,880
 "This confounds my ideological belief,

297
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,480
 "stubbornly refuses to fit in my worldview,

298
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
 "and has embarrassed my growing belief

299
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
 "that there is no God.

300
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,340
 "Though I'm an atheist, I'm convinced

301
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,080
 "of the enormous contribution Christian evangelism,

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,500
 "or the body of Christ, or the message of Jesus,

303
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,900
 "makes in Africa, distinct from all the other works

304
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,100
 "of government projects, secular NGOs, international aid.

305
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,820
 "These alone will not do."

306
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,460
 It then says, "In Africa, Christianity changes

307
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,580
 "people's hearts, and the change is good.

308
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,040
 "Christians, black and white, working in Africa

309
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,280
 "do heal the sick, do teach people to read and write.

310
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,660
 "Only the severest kind of secularist

311
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,380
 "could see a mission hospital or school,

312
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,280
 "and say the world would be better off without that.

313
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,820
 "Missionaries," I love it,

314
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,260
 "not aid money, are the solution

315
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,760
 "to Africa's biggest problem.

316
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,680
 "Removing Christian evangelism from African equation

317
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,280
 "may leave the continent at the mercy

318
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,580
 "of a malign fusion of Nike, the witch doctor,

319
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,940
 "the mobile phone, and the machete."

320
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,660
 That even an atheist looks and says,

321
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,100
 "Man, I've gotta confess, these people need God."

322
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,920
 Where he gets it wrong is he says,

323
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,380
 "Africa, what's true is he needs God.

324
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,500
 "All people need God.

325
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,380
 "In every place and in every space.

326
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,400
 "Dallas, Boise, Scottsdale,

327
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
 "is filled with people who need God,

328
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
 "and Daniel has a confidence that comes from men.

329
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,300
 "I bring to the table something that every person needs

330
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,460
 "because I know my creator."

331
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,700
 The second thing we see in the story,

332
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,660
 and I think it's unbelievably profound,

333
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,260
 is the prediction that he now makes.

334
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,940
 The interpretation of the king's dream.

335
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,340
 He goes, basically, and he goes and prays,

336
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,860
 and that night, it says, verse 19,

337
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,840
 "God revealed the vision to Daniel.

338
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,560
 "Daniel then praised God and said,

339
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,720
 "Praise the name of God forever and ever.

340
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,840
 "He has all wisdom and power.

341
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,840
 "He controls the course of human events, or world events.

342
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,900
 "Our God removes kings and sets up other kings.

343
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,600
 "He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to scholars.

344
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
 "He reveals deep and mysterious things.

345
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,660
 "He knows what lies hidden in darkness,

346
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,000
 "though he's surrounded by light.

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,780
 "I thank you and praise you, God, of my ancestors."

348
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,920
 Daniel prays, he then goes back and says,

349
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,800
 "Hey, take me to the king.

350
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,520
 "I will tell him the interpretation."

351
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,840
 Shows up at the king, and the king says,

352
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
 "Do you know what it means?

353
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,500
 "Do you know my dream?

354
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,680
 "Do you know the interpretation?"

355
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,280
 And this is how Daniel responds.

356
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,560
 Verse 27, "Daniel replied,

357
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,240
 "There are no wise men, enchanters,

358
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,700
 "magicians, or fortune tellers

359
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,340
 "who can reveal the king's secret.

360
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,900
 "But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets.

361
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,100
 "He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar

362
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,520
 "what will happen in the future.

363
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,020
 "Now I will tell of your dream

364
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,440
 "and the visions that you had."

365
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,100
 And he says, "Nobody can tell this,

366
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,660
 "but there is a God in heaven.

367
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,560
 "And he has told you what is going to happen

368
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,720
 "in the centuries to follow

369
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,320
 "and for the rest of human history.

370
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,800
 "And here is your dream, king."

371
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
 And then he says, and this is the point

372
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,800
 where if your mind works like mine,

373
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,640
 inside of watching the movie of this happen,

374
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,080
 this is when the suspenseful music turns on

375
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,000
 and the king leans forward in his throne

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,360
 as he hears Daniel describe exactly what you dreamed.

377
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,280
 He says, "In your vision, your majesty,

378
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,280
 "you saw before you a huge shining statue of a man.

379
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,160
 "It was a frightening sight.

380
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,400
 "The head of the statue was made of fine gold.

381
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
 "Its chest and arms were of silver.

382
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,640
 "Its belly and thighs were of bronze.

383
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,920
 "Its legs were iron.

384
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 "And its feet were a combination of iron and clay.

385
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,960
 "As you watched this statue in front of you,

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,840
 "all of a sudden a rock cut from a mountain,

387
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
 "not made by human hands,

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,160
 "struck the feet of iron and clay, smashing it to bits.

389
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,560
 "The whole statue crushed into small pieces of clay,

390
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,120
 "iron, gold, and bronze.

391
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,080
 "Then the wind blew away all of them without a trace,

392
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,040
 "like chaff on a threshing floor.

393
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,840
 "But the rock that knocked down the statue

394
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,360
 "became a great mountain that covered the whole earth."

395
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
 He says, "You saw there was a statue

396
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,240
 "and the head was made of something

397
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
 "and the arms were made of silver

398
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
 "and then the chest and the thighs were made of bronze

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,720
 "and the legs were made of iron.

400
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,120
 "And then this rock comes out of nowhere

401
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,200
 "and it hits the feet of the statue

402
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,960
 "and the entire thing crumbles and collapses."

403
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,320
 And the king is realizing, "That's exactly what I saw."

404
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,840
 And then Daniel says, "And here's the meaning of your dream."

405
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,400
 This is what he says, verse 36.

406
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,240
 "Now we will tell you what it means.

407
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,000
 "Your majesty, you are the king of kings,

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 "or the greatest of kings.

409
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,840
 "God has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor.

410
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,440
 "He made you the ruler over all of the inhabited world.

411
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,560
 "You're the ruler of the known world.

412
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,200
 "You and your kingdom is the head of gold."

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,360
 So the first empire that we're told of

414
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,640
 is the Babylonian, the head of gold, if you will.

415
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,800
 The statue, a replica, a remake of it is right there.

416
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,320
 And he sees this image and the head is gold

417
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,400
 and the reason Babylon would have been gold

418
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
 is like I said earlier, the amount of gold,

419
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,440
 people didn't even know existed in the entire world,

420
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 that the city was filled with it.

421
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,520
 And then he says, "But there's another kingdom,"

422
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,720
 verse 37, 39.

423
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,480
 "But after your kingdom,"

424
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,560
 in other words, your kingdom will come to an end.

425
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,560
 "Another kingdom inferior to yours

426
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,960
 "will rise and take your place."

427
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
 The two arms are made out of silver

428
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,320
 and the silver kingdom is the Medo-Persian kingdom.

429
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,440
 It was these two groups that combined,

430
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
 Medes and the Persians,

431
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,480
 that eventually 100 years later,

432
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,080
 or no, 50 years later, would conquer Babylon.

433
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,760
 And it's represented by these two arms coming together.

434
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,120
 And it will take down your kingdom.

435
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,680
 And then he says, "And then there's another kingdom

436
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
 "that's coming."

437
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,400
 Verse 30, 40.

438
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,160
 "After that kingdom has fallen,

439
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,000
 "yet a third kingdom represented by bronze

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,560
 "will rise to rule the world."

441
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,360
 So he says there's the gold kingdom,

442
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,960
 then there's gonna be another kingdom that takes you down.

443
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,480
 Then there's gonna be a kingdom after you,

444
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,920
 which would be the kingdom of Greece.

445
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 Why would it be the kingdom of bronze?

446
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,360
 Well, the Greek kingdom, again, none of this has happened.

447
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,760
 Daniel's saying this is what's about to happen

448
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,800
 in the next few centuries.

449
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 The bronze kingdom was led by a guy named Alexander the Great.

450
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
 Alexander the Great mastered, perfected,

451
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,880
 had his soldiers perfect the use of bronze in weaponry.

452
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
 So it was the bronze kingdom.

453
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
 Alexander the Great would conquer the known world

454
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,080
 from Egypt to India by the age of 33.

455
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
 And he would conquer and come in

456
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
 and be the third kingdom represented here.

457
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,080
 What's interesting is 200 years later,

458
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,200
 when Alexander was conquering the world

459
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
 and establishing his kingdom,

460
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
 he comes outside of Jerusalem.

461
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,320
 And he's about to take on Israel.

462
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,640
 And the high priest goes outside of the city

463
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,760
 and brings with him the book of Daniel

464
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,560
 and says, "Don't kill us.

465
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,800
 "We saw you coming.

466
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,440
 "Our God told us that you were here

467
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
 "and that you would conquer."

468
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,200
 And Alexander the Great is so flattered

469
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,880
 that his kingdom would be written and prophesied about

470
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
 in here and in chapter seven

471
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,640
 that he doesn't destroy the city and moves forward.

472
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,880
 And yet after this kingdom,

473
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
 we're told of another one that would raise up,

474
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
 where Daniel says, "Following that kingdom,

475
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,720
 "there will be a fourth one.

476
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,960
 "It will be strong as iron,

477
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,960
 "and that kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires

478
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,000
 "just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes."

479
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,440
 So it's gonna be an even stronger kingdom.

480
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,640
 Iron was known as the strongest metal at the time.

481
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,520
 And this kingdom would be represented by Rome.

482
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,760
 It would be stronger than all the others.

483
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
 And Rome established a military might

484
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
 unlike anything the world had ever seen.

485
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
 And they ruled for hundreds of years.

486
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,560
 All of this is written 600 years

487
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,400
 before any of that would ever happen.

488
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
 And Daniel's saying, "Kingdom of heaven,

489
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,960
 "God has told you what is going to happen."

490
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,840
 Now before we go to the next point

491
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,200
 and discover why he was so terrified at that reality,

492
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,120
 I just wanna camp on something in the second observation.

493
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,320
 Everything is under God's control.

494
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,000
 Everyone needs God, and everything is under God's control.

495
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
 I want you to think about what Daniel just said.

496
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,160
 We often think that, "Man, where is God

497
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
 "and how could this be happening?"

498
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,160
 And Daniel just said, "There's gonna be an empire

499
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,400
 "set up by Alexander the Great,

500
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,680
 "who is anything but a worshiper of God,

501
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 "and God's gonna be sovereignly over him ruling."

502
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,560
 There's gonna be an empire set up by the Persians.

503
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,520
 Remember Xerxes?

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,560
 And they're gonna basically invent crucifixion,

505
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,880
 and they're gonna be a wicked-filled people,

506
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,200
 but God is going to allow their empire to be established.

507
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,960
 God is gonna allow the Roman Empire to be established.

508
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,280
 That God is in control of everything,

509
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,640
 and these men sit and they think that they're in control.

510
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,640
 They are pawns in the story God is writing.

511
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,200
 And he will use anyone and everyone and everything

512
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,640
 because everything is underneath God's control.

513
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,280
 Daniel even highlights this in verse 21, where he says,

514
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,200
 "He controls the course of world events.

515
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,040
 "He removes kings and he sets up other kings.

516
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,360
 "That he is sovereign and in control

517
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,200
 "over what is happening in Ukraine,

518
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,800
 "over what's happening in Dallas,

519
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,000
 "over what's happening in Russia,

520
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
 "what happened in Iran.

521
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,400
 "That God is sovereign and in control over all of it."

522
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,160
 And the Scripture tells us that as believers,

523
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,520
 we have a promise from God that he is using

524
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,680
 and will use everything in this life

525
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,520
 to bring about good for those who love him.

526
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
 Romans chapter eight, verse 28 says that,

527
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,720
 "God works all things together for good

528
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,920
 "for the people of God or for those who love him."

529
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,000
 And make no mistake, King Nebuchadnezzar,

530
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 you are not in control, but there is one who is.

531
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,420
 My wife, in this season, 'cause we have a newborn,

532
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,480
 often will send me and I'll take the kids

533
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,240
 and we'll go shopping because there's some age

534
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,280
 where it's like until 12 weeks and they have shots,

535
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,760
 you're basically kind of like on lockdown with the baby

536
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,200
 and so she'll hang at home with them

537
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,160
 and I'll take the other two kids

538
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,680
 and we'll go out shopping,

539
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,720
 which is honestly one of the most exhausting things

540
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,520
 of all time because you walk into a store

541
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,580
 and you got two little kids

542
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,520
 and they're just going crazy running around

543
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,600
 and you're trying to just walk the walk of shame

544
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,440
 as people look at you like,

545
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
 "What kind of parent are you right there?

546
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,280
 "They don't even have clothes on."

547
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,620
 And they're running around going like,

548
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,080
 "Hey, can we get a toy, can we get a toy, can we?"

549
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
 And I'm like, "We're at the gas station,

550
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,800
 "they don't have toys at the gas station."

551
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,840
 And that's just what they think.

552
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,280
 Anytime that they go shopping anywhere,

553
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
 they're going to get a toy.

554
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
 And so it's just madness.

555
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,040
 And sometimes I honestly just give them a toy,

556
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,880
 just stop, just stop, take the toy.

557
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,560
 There's one exception to shopping that honestly,

558
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,220
 it focuses all of their energy

559
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,280
 and distracts them with enough time

560
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,200
 that it makes it a little bit more enjoyable.

561
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,760
 And that's when you go to a shopping center

562
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,600
 that has a shopping cart with a car on it.

563
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,160
 Looks something like this.

564
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,080
 Why is that important?

565
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,600
 Because they get in the cart

566
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,420
 and they think that they're driving the cart.

567
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,320
 And so they're like, "Yes, we're going this way

568
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,960
 "and yes, we're going this way."

569
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
 And they're taking turns and they're going around

570
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
 and we're going through and getting the list of things

571
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,160
 mom said we gotta go get.

572
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,940
 Inevitably, while we're driving,

573
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,640
 there comes a point where they wanna take another lap

574
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,480
 around the store and I need to go get a light bulb

575
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,320
 or go get something else.

576
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,120
 And they turn right and I turn left.

577
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,920
 And they discover, "Wait a second.

578
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
 (congregation laughing)

579
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,400
 "I'm not driving this thing at all."

580
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,120
 And they may throw a fit, they may freak out,

581
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,160
 they may react, but they become very aware

582
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,360
 who's driving the cart.

583
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,480
 And the message of the Bible and what Daniel is depicting

584
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,260
 is that don't buy the lie that you're driving the cart.

585
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,860
 But there is a God in heaven who is actively involved

586
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,760
 in the events and the circumstances of the world around you

587
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,880
 and he is in control.

588
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,760
 And there is nothing that you or I will ever face

589
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,500
 that he is not sovereignly over,

590
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,920
 that he is not in power over,

591
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,680
 that he will not use to bring about good from

592
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,840
 for the people of God.

593
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,800
 Because he's in control.

594
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,160
 And this should move us to do a couple things

595
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
 that I think Daniel models.

596
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,760
 One of them is Daniel is faced with a problem

597
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,600
 and what does he do?

598
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
 He immediately moves to pray.

599
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,240
 Because he knew, "My God controls everything.

600
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,780
 "He controls king's hearts.

601
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,720
 "He controls everything that is.

602
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
 "So I'm gonna go to him in prayer."

603
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,920
 How often when problems hit do you not turn,

604
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,000
 do I not turn to God and ask him for help?

605
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,080
 God, you know what I'm walking through right now at work

606
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,560
 and you know what I'm concerned about

607
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
 as it relates to this presentation

608
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,640
 or my boss's opinion of me?

609
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,720
 And we don't ask God for help.

610
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,680
 Like Daniel models just what a belief

611
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,480
 and a death grip on my God is in control of everything.

612
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,420
 And so I can ask him because he can change and do anything

613
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,140
 and it moves him to go to God in prayer.

614
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,340
 The second thing that we see modeled out from him

615
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,700
 is that it moves him to trust that even,

616
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,420
 I mean Daniel is sitting in the palace

617
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,300
 600 miles away from his home.

618
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,300
 He had every reason to believe,

619
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,500
 "God has forgotten me, God is up to nothing.

620
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,620
 "I'm about to get killed by this crazy king

621
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,260
 "if I can't tell him his dream."

622
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,400
 And yet he believed, "God is still in control,

623
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,160
 "he can answer my prayer and I'm gonna choose to trust him."

624
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
 What's astounding about the predictions is,

625
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,280
 think about it, all of these would come to pass

626
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,160
 and Daniel lays out these are the only empires

627
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,480
 that will ever exist.

628
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,400
 And to this day he's been correct.

629
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,800
 I mean, March Madness is going on right now

630
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,580
 and in the history of March Madness,

631
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,580
 not one person has ever predicted successfully a bracket,

632
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,520
 not one.

633
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,160
 And he lays out and predicts every world empire

634
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,200
 that will ever be and gets them exactly right.

635
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,920
 Because he knew the God who controls everything.

636
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,720
 Finally, final observation that we see

637
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,560
 is that every kingdom but God's won't last.

638
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,640
 It says this, "The feet and the toes you saw

639
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,620
 "were a combination of iron and clay,

640
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,440
 "showing this kingdom, this next kingdom,

641
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,600
 "will be divided like iron mixed with clay.

642
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,980
 "It will have some strength of iron,

643
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,860
 "but while some parts of it will be as strong as iron,

644
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,920
 "other will be as weak as clay.

645
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,340
 "The mixture of iron and clay shows that these kingdoms

646
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,040
 "will strengthen themselves by forming alliances

647
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,320
 "through inner marriage,

648
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,600
 "but they will not hold together

649
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,240
 "just as iron and clay do not mix."

650
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,840
 What is he saying right there?

651
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,620
 This is one of those that the interpretation is divided.

652
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,440
 It's either referring to what happened after Rome,

653
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
 which was Europe,

654
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,140
 and that there would be kingdoms that would rise up,

655
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,680
 but no super kingdom would ever quite dominate

656
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,000
 all of that area, and they would have marriages

657
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,480
 where Henry V would marry some French lady

658
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,840
 and they'd try to hold and build a stronger kingdom,

659
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,140
 but it wouldn't last.

660
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,980
 Or he's referring to a kingdom

661
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,020
 that will rise up at the very end,

662
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,100
 made up of 10 kings like the 10 toes in the feet

663
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,260
 that Revelation points to.

664
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,740
 Either way, it's Daniel reflecting,

665
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,420
 hey, there was not going to be another superpower like these

666
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,520
 that will rule, expand, and conquer all of the world.

667
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,220
 But during the reign of those kings, verse 44,

668
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,220
 the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

669
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,880
 that will never be destroyed or conquered.

670
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,380
 It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness.

671
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,540
 It will stand forever.

672
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,000
 That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain,

673
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,120
 though not by human hands,

674
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,100
 that crushed to pieces the statue,

675
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,140
 the great God was showing the king

676
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,460
 what will happen in the future.

677
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,500
 The dream is true and its meaning is certain.

678
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,140
 Nebuchadnezzar hears it, knows it,

679
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,660
 falls, we're told, verse 46, at Daniel's feet,

680
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,700
 and he worshiped him, commanded sacrifices be made,

681
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,980
 and then he said to Daniel,

682
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,920
 truly your God is the greatest of all gods,

683
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,220
 the Lord over kings, revealer of mysteries.

684
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,260
 You have revealed the secret.

685
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,980
 Then he gives Daniel a promotion,

686
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,820
 puts him in charge of all the wise men.

687
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,220
 The final thing we see is that every kingdom

688
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,240
 but God's won't last.

689
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,140
 This is why Nebuchadnezzar was terrified.

690
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,940
 And candidly, this is why a lot of people,

691
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,780
 when they think about the end of their life,

692
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,620
 become terrified.

693
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,220
 Nebuchadnezzar is confronted with the fact that,

694
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,900
 hey, there's gonna come another kingdom

695
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,320
 that's going to destroy yours.

696
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,420
 Yours is not gonna last.

697
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,580
 In fact, every human kingdom will be ultimately destroyed,

698
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,500
 and it filled him with terror.

699
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,100
 That I've built my entire life

700
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,900
 trying to build walls of security,

701
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,700
 trying to build a name for myself.

702
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,660
 And Daniel is saying, your kingdom will not last.

703
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,220
 What you have given all of your strength

704
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,780
 and years of life to will be blown away,

705
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,940
 like a sand castle when the tide comes in,

706
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,260
 and you will have wasted your life, oh king,

707
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,740
 because every kingdom but God's won't last.

708
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,420
 The same instruction is applicable to us today.

709
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,460
 And knowing that God's kingdom alone will last,

710
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
 it will do two things.

711
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,540
 It'll either create hope when you hear that,

712
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,140
 man, I've given my life to the only thing

713
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,660
 that eternally is going to matter,

714
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,660
 or horror when your life is done.

715
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,300
 Because you will realize you have wasted,

716
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,900
 and you have given yourself to something

717
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,900
 that will not last, and wasted your life.

718
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,740
 And the king felt horror as he looked

719
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,540
 at the coming kingdom of God.

720
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,660
 The other thing that we see is the stone,

721
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,100
 which is Daniel in his picture of Jesus.

722
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,740
 Notice it said, a stone not cut by human hands.

723
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,580
 What does that mean?

724
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,140
 It was a stone that was divinely created.

725
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,180
 It wasn't cut from the mountain by any human work.

726
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,140
 It was a stone that had not been formed by human hands,

727
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,540
 and it's gonna come down,

728
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,780
 and it's gonna crush every kingdom that exists.

729
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,180
 That Jesus will establish a kingdom,

730
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,140
 and every other kingdom in this world,

731
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,700
 and every leading nation and empire

732
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,700
 will be crushed underneath the wonder

733
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,900
 of the everlasting kingdom Jesus is going to create.

734
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,420
 Daniel says it's true, it's sure, it's coming.

735
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,180
 Our God is establishing a kingdom that will never fade,

736
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,100
 and every kingdom but God's won't last.

737
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,740
 As it's been said, history,

738
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,420
 and the point of all of human history

739
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,100
 is that it is his story, our God's.

740
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,580
 Daniel is giving a spoiler alert to Nebuchadnezzar.

741
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,020
 You are gonna waste your life,

742
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,180
 and you will waste your life if you spend it

743
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,100
 trying to build and amass your kingdom,

744
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,660
 and focused on you getting the house,

745
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,540
 and getting the car, and getting the raise,

746
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,020
 and make them a million by 30,

747
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,340
 all of which are great, and I hope that you do,

748
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,460
 but if that is the focal point of your life,

749
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,940
 you are building a kingdom that will not last.

750
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,660
 And the scriptures teach us

751
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,300
 the way that we live for an eternal kingdom

752
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,100
 starts with living with an eternal mindset.

753
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
 What do I mean by that?

754
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,220
 You read the New Testament,

755
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,060
 and you see verses like,

756
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,700
 hey, set your mind on things above.

757
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,560
 Colossians chapter three, verse two says.

758
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,880
 Or in 2 Corinthians chapter four, it says,

759
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,500
 we fix our eyes not on what is seen,

760
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,540
 but on what is unseen, because what is seen is temporary,

761
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
 but what is unseen is eternal,

762
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,700
 and that's where we fix our focus,

763
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,520
 and that leads to living from an eternal mindset.

764
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,640
 And the scriptures say that when it comes

765
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,860
 to how you think about your life,

766
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,260
 the way that you and I live for a kingdom

767
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,580
 that actually will last is we begin

768
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,500
 to think through the lens of eternity.

769
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,340
 What does that mean?

770
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,160
 It means your job.

771
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,420
 You don't see yourself just there to work, get a paycheck.

772
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,700
 You see yourself there as someone to promote

773
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,460
 the name of Jesus, to share the gospel

774
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,100
 with people around you, to speak.

775
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,980
 When somebody brings up how they're walking

776
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,740
 through a hard time, and they really are facing challenges,

777
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,740
 you're a voice that's there that says,

778
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,180
 can I tell you where I turn when things are hard?

779
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,060
 Can I just share what I feel like God

780
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,580
 has been really growing in me lately?

781
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,500
 And you see it as an eternal opportunity

782
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,500
 as Titus chapter two says, to promote in everything

783
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,380
 the teachings of our Savior.

784
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,720
 It means when it comes to thinking of a spouse,

785
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,920
 you think through the lens of eternity,

786
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,060
 but you're not just looking for somebody who's hot or not,

787
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,180
 or somebody that has some sort of body type.

788
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,800
 I'm looking for someone who has an eternal mindset,

789
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,180
 because no human relationship is gonna impact this life

790
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,220
 or my eternal life and how I use this life like my spouse.

791
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,380
 So I'm looking for somebody who wants to lock arms

792
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,140
 as we raise disciples, make babies, and live for eternity.

793
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,420
 It looks like when it comes to your time,

794
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,500
 you don't think, oh, my 20s, these are my years

795
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,020
 to spend on you, to sow my wild oats.

796
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,140
 It looks like I wanna live for Jesus and my generation,

797
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,760
 and I'm gonna use the life, the gifts, the time

798
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,820
 that he has given me to do what Ecclesiastes 12 says,

799
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,380
 and I'm gonna remember my creator and my youth,

800
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,180
 'cause I'm gonna build him the only kingdom that will last.

801
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,140
 And Daniel has a confidence, 'cause he says,

802
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,820
 "You, king, you've been building a kingdom

803
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,820
 "that's gonna crumble, and God is telling you

804
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,780
 "the human history."

805
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,660
 He doesn't tell anybody else this specific

806
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,580
 of a narrative of what is to come,

807
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,660
 because God wants you to repent.

808
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,880
 God's pursuing you, Nebuchadnezzar.

809
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
 He wants you to know you don't have to give your life

810
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,180
 to building your kingdom, and you can know the God of heaven

811
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,220
 and you can be a part of building his,

812
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,060
 or you will be crushed by it.

813
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:24,340
 And Daniel models living and embracing,

814
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,520
 I'm gonna have a mindset that flows

815
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,660
 from my relationship with my God.

816
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,460
 In the inside of my wedding ring,

817
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,340
 my wife had written 2 Corinthians 5,

818
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,740
 verse 14 and 15, where it talks about Paul's description

819
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,340
 of how we now see this life as those of us

820
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,500
 who are believers and that we live

821
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,540
 the only kingdom that lasts.

822
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,820
 He says in verse 14, 2 Corinthians chapter five,

823
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,820
 "Christ's love compels us, for we are convinced

824
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,820
 "that one died for all," that's Jesus,

825
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,040
 "and therefore all died, and he died for all

826
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,120
 "that those who live should no longer live for themselves,

827
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,120
 "but for him who died for them and was raised again.

828
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,180
 "We therefore," verse 20, "are Christ's ambassadors,

829
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,300
 "as though God was making his appeal through us."

830
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,860
 There was a story this week that I read

831
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,760
 of a missionary named James Calvert.

832
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,660
 He was a missionary to the Fiji Islands in the mid-1800s.

833
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,700
 And when you think of Fiji, you probably think like I do

834
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,700
 with just huts over the water that have glass.

835
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,180
 It's like, that's a pretty sweet gig to be a missionary to.

836
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,540
 But Fiji in the 1850s was very different.

837
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,740
 And the island had native tribes that were there

838
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,820
 that were cannibals.

839
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,220
 And James Calvert felt called to go

840
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,900
 and share the message of Jesus with these men.

841
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,020
 And so he took a group with him,

842
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,860
 and they were going there to share the gospel,

843
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
 and they get on the boat, and they ride over,

844
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,040
 and they arrive at Fiji, and the captain of the boat says,

845
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,440
 "You can't stay here.

846
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,860
 "If you stay here, you will die,

847
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,100
 "and all of the men with you will die."

848
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,280
 And James Calvert responds and says,

849
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,880
 "We died before we came here."

850
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,300
 In Christ, we died to ambition, selfish goals,

851
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,940
 our own dreams, we died to self

852
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,340
 and everything that self desires.

853
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,740
 We died that Christ may live in and through us,

854
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,820
 that whatever we attempt within his call of God

855
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,900
 brings him glory.

856
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,940
 We died before we came here so that there'd be no hindrance,

857
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,900
 no barriers within ourselves to follow Christ

858
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,580
 in the areas of the world where there is a great darkness

859
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,220
 and a yearning for the light.

860
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,060
 What is he saying?

861
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,540
 He's saying, "I've already died to living for myself.

862
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,580
 "I'm not here for that purpose.

863
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,860
 "I'm here to build the only kingdom that matters."

864
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,820
 And that will last.

865
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,820
 In conclusion, everyone needs God,

866
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,060
 everything is under God's control,

867
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,060
 and every kingdom with God or other than God's will fade.

868
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,300
 Now there's one last prediction that I didn't highlight

869
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,920
 that you see has happened.

870
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,940
 And it's a prediction that he had in verse 34 and 35.

871
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,800
 I'm gonna read it again.

872
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,400
 Daniel's saying, "Here's what you saw.

873
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,160
 "You saw the statue and then you saw this rock

874
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,500
 "and it came out of the heavens

875
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,460
 "and it smashed every earthly kingdom.

876
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,900
 "And then that stone grew and became a great mountain

877
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,840
 "that filled the whole earth."

878
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,020
 What is he talking about?

879
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,500
 He's talking about Jesus.

880
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,740
 He's talking about the message of Jesus.

881
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,580
 And this is another one of the prophecies

882
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,580
 that we have seen happen with a message of Christianity,

883
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,140
 the message of Jesus, which is what?

884
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,500
 In case you're curious, it's that God came into the world

885
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,220
 in the form of Christ, Jesus, 2000 years ago,

886
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,020
 and he died on a cross for you, for me,

887
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,020
 for anyone who's ever sinned, which is everyone.

888
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,500
 And he gave his life as the payment for your sin.

889
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,860
 And anyone who believes in him

890
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,100
 and accepts his death and resurrection

891
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,260
 as payment for the mistakes they've made,

892
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,740
 the sin in their life, they will live forever,

893
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,500
 the Bible says.

894
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 And that message has exploded past the walls of the empire.

895
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,420
 It was formed in and spread all over the earth,

896
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,540
 and that stone has become a great mountain

897
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,420
 covering the whole earth.

898
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,340
 What do I mean by that?

899
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,660
 People think of Christianity as something

900
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,440
 that's in the West or it's something in America.

901
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,900
 Christianity is exploding all over the world.

902
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,260
 You look at Latin America, you look at Asia-America,

903
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,940
 and the countries that are exploding with Christianity

904
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,780
 far outnumber even today.

905
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,500
 In fact, the fastest places the gospel is growing today

906
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,860
 is Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

907
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,460
 Two-thirds of all self-identifying Christians today

908
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,180
 live in Africa, Asia, or Latin America.

909
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,220
 To say Christianity is just something for white people

910
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,940
 in the West or something for Americans

911
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,060
 or something for, is crazy,

912
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,900
 and lives in denial of what is actually true.

913
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,020
 The fact that the gospel is exploding all over Africa today,

914
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
 there are more practicing Christians in Africa

915
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,780
 than all of Europe combined.

916
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,220
 There are more Anglicans, which is the Church of England,

917
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,620
 in Africa than there are in England.

918
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,900
 There are more Presbyterian,

919
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,220
 which is the Church of Scotland, inside of Ghana,

920
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,660
 than there are in Scotland.

921
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,900
 There are more Christian scholars say today in China

922
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,620
 than all of America, and by 2050,

923
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,660
 it is estimated that the population of China

924
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,380
 will be a majority Christian nation

925
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,260
 in a country where it is outlawed.

926
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,620
 The message of Jesus is exploding

927
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,500
 because our God said it would be a message

928
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,380
 that would be a stone that will eventually topple

929
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,700
 all earthly kingdoms and it will spread

930
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,060
 and be a mountain covering the whole Earth.

931
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,100
 Don't buy the lie that Christianity

932
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,500
 is in any form on its way out,

933
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,900
 because our God is a rock of salvation

934
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,100
 to those who trust in him,

935
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,160
 and a rock that will not be stopped,

936
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,500
 and a force that is growing all over

937
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,580
 (congregation applauding)

938
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,100
 through the same God that worked through Daniel.

939
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,940
 Let me pray.

940
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,060
 Father, I thank you that you are at work all over our world,

941
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,460
 and there are brothers and sisters right now

942
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,220
 that are praying in every language,

943
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,100
 of every socioeconomic status,

944
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:41,280
 of every skin color, every nationality,

945
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,100
 and hundreds of languages,

946
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,600
 and they're crying out and praying to the same God

947
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,700
 that Daniel prayed to, that gave Nebuchadnezzar the dream.

948
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,780
 I pray that you would prevent this generation,

949
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,420
 ourselves, from living for a kingdom that will not last.

950
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,220
 I pray that anyone who's never put their faith

951
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,580
 in that message that is spreading and filling

952
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,060
 the whole Earth of our God who came to save,

953
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,140
 tonight would be their night.

954
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,540
 We worship you in song, amen.
