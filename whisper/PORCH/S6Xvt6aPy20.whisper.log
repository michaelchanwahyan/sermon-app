[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:20.900]   All right.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.520]   How you guys doing?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.920]   Dallas, Fort Worth, you guys doing well?
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.420]   All right.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.840]   Well, it is so fun to be with you guys.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.380]   God has used the porch to change my life in so many ways.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.140]   And so it's a joy to be up here.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.160]   It really is surreal.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.000]   Recently, we were on a porch leadership retreat.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.280]   And so what that means is about twice a year,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280]   our staff team and our key volunteers,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.520]   we'll just get out of Dallas.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.960]   And there'll be about 20 of us.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   And we just spend time together, really.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.060]   We want to just kind of deepen bonds
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.360]   of those who are serving and leading here.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600]   And the agenda is just to have as much fun as possible,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.940]   honestly, and hopefully know and love each other more
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.160]   at the end of our time.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.760]   And we had one a couple of weeks ago.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.280]   And so we were kind of reminiscing,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   like, what's the greatest retreat we've ever done?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.700]   What's the greatest memory?
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.160]   And the Dust Bowl came to mind.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.600]   And the retreats are often-- they don't really
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.640]   happen like you think they would.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480]   This particular time, we were headed out to Bonham, Texas.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.120]   You familiar with Bonham?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.560]   Yeah, a couple of you from there.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.800]   And so we had been given a lake house to use for the weekend.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.480]   And so we were headed out that way.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.600]   And I don't know about you, but whenever I kind of
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.720]   get out of Dallas, the busyness of just the fast pace,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.520]   like I'm at a lake, I am just content to chill.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   Like, I could just sip coffee, stare at the water,
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   and I'm good, you know?
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.040]   We had a boat this particular weekend, a Malibu wakesetter.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   There was just perfect glass out there.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.780]   We could ski, wakeboard.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.460]   I'm like, we have arrived.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.080]   We don't need to do anything else.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.140]   We don't need to go anywhere.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.880]   JP, on the other hand, the boss man, as you know,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.840]   he kind of had a different plan this particular weekend.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.000]   He's always after that unique shared experience.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.980]   Have you guys heard this term?
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.520]   Like, he's always trying to make memories on our team.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.480]   And so he's like, he had seen a flea market
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.920]   coming into the lake house.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.080]   He's like, wake up Saturday morning.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.480]   He's like, guys, we should check out that flea market.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.680]   And I'm like, thinking in my mind, I'm like,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.720]   flea market of everything we could do out here at the lake.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.100]   Like, going to a flea market, not even in my top 10,000.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.680]   I mean, it just like nowhere near there.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280]   But we do, we wake up, we decide to go there
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   on Saturday morning.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.720]   And we're having fun, kinda.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.240]   But we see this guy there and he's standing by a race car.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   And he's kind of promoting a race that was happening
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   later on that night in town.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.860]   And again, I'm thinking like small town Texas,
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.680]   dirt track, car races, people die there.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.400]   Like, that doesn't sound fun.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.080]   That doesn't even sound safe, you know what I mean?
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.040]   I'm like, no, thank you.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.140]   But again, JP's like, guys, we gotta make a memory.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.000]   Let's go, let's go, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.560]   And so, maybe you're noticing a theme.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.480]   We decide to go to the Dust Bowl that night.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.840]   And the guy that was promoing, he's kinda like,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.700]   it's close, you know, it's like just down the road.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.580]   And so we take off, we're driving,
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.000]   and it's been like 35 minutes.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.920]   And we're like, JP, buddy, we are so lost.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.400]   Like, this place is not here.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.120]   I mean, we're driving through like trees
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   where there's canopies over us,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   and we're not seeing cars for like 20 minutes.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.160]   We're like, buddy, boss man, this is not the right place.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.720]   Like, this feels more like the Blair Witch Project
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.560]   than anything.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.240]   Like, this is, like, we're so lost.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.920]   And, but bless him, man, he's like, no, no, no,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.740]   this is the way.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.760]   Like, I am sure it's gonna be awesome.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.660]   Like, we have to stay the course.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.320]   Keep going, it's gonna be great.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.520]   We're like, okay.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.680]   So, we keep driving, and sure enough, guys,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.440]   we turn this one corner, and we look on the horizon,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.560]   and in the middle of like nowhere,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   I don't even know where we were,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.760]   it looked like Jerry World.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520]   It was like, what?
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   Like, we did not see that coming.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.520]   It is like this huge stadium,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.040]   and you could hear kind of the buzz of the cars
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.120]   going around the track, and people are pulling in.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.040]   And here's the deal, like, we had an amazing time
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   that night.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.100]   Like, the guy from the flea market,
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.600]   he came out and met us, and he was like,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080]   hey, yeah, come on, guys, come on in, park here.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.800]   He kind of gave us the red carpet tour of the place,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.880]   and he took us into the pit.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.200]   We got to meet the drivers, take pictures,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.000]   and we had an absolute blast.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.960]   Like, the greatest memory that we've probably
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.160]   ever had together as a leadership team
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.240]   was that night at the porch.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.360]   And at the Dust Bowl, excuse me.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.440]   And, nice, see what I did there?
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.040]   And here's why I tell you that story.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.760]   Have you ever felt like, just in life,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.320]   like maybe right now, like, you ever felt
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.440]   like you're just going the wrong direction?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.080]   You know, like the path that you're on,
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.720]   you're just like, man, I'm not in the right place.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.160]   Like, I'm just, I'm not going,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.440]   I don't like where I'm at, you know?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.800]   And specifically, like, is there a boss over you,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.480]   an authority figure, and he's kind of calling the shots,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.080]   he's kind of driving the car, if you will,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.400]   and you're just like, man,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   I don't know that I trust that guy, you know?
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   And if I'm honest, like, I'd like to drive,
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.960]   'cause I could drive a lot better than this guy.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.920]   I have felt like that so much of my life,
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.840]   specifically as it relates to my job,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.560]   which is what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.440]   Like, guys, I have been a schizophrenic.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.360]   Like, I have jumped around from job to job,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.440]   industry to industry.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.680]   I've worked at big companies,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.200]   I've worked at small companies,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.080]   I've worked for Christians,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   I've worked for non-Christians,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.600]   I've worked at businesses,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.640]   now I'm working at a church.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   I'm like, what am I doing, you know?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.720]   But I have thought so much of my life.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.600]   I'm like, am I going the right direction?
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.760]   Like, am I doing this deal right?
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.880]   And I have wrestled so much with the question,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.080]   what is God's will for our work?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.920]   And that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.200]   What is God's will for our work?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.280]   Specifically, we're gonna answer three questions tonight.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.320]   We're gonna talk about who we are working for,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.360]   number one, who we're working for,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   number two, what we are working for,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.440]   and number three, how we are to work
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.920]   as followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.720]   We are continuing this series.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.120]   Colossians, you guys enjoying this?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.320]   Good, a couple of you guys?
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.800]   You're like, bring back a dating series,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   those are more fun.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   No, this is awesome, man.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   Like, I love to learn books of the Bible together.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.000]   And so we're continuing Paul's letter to the Colossians,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.400]   and Paul is doing what he so often does
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.280]   in a lot of his letters.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.760]   If you look at him, he will kind of start very high level
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.240]   kind of doctrine, theology,
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.360]   towards the beginning of the letter,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.600]   and then he'll come back around and go,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.960]   okay, this is what it looks like to apply that.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.120]   Like, this is how we're gonna live that out.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.080]   And so the text that we're gonna cover tonight
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.320]   is going to do that, Colossians 3, 17.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.520]   You can turn there, and we're gonna go through,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.360]   actually, the beginning of chapter four.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.120]   So I invite you guys to turn there.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.840]   Read with me in verse 17.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.160]   "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   "do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.360]   "giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.640]   "Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.600]   "as is fitting in the Lord.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.920]   "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.640]   "Children, obey your parents in everything,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.600]   "for this pleases the Lord.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   "Fathers, do not embitter your children,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.600]   "or they will become discouraged.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.040]   "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.400]   "and do it not only when their eye is on you
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.200]   "to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   "and reverence for the Lord."
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.200]   That's a rich text.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.600]   Two observations as I kinda started to study this.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.120]   One is honestly a little bit more personal,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.000]   and the other one applies to the text.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   I see kinda the two big, dirty S words
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.520]   of the Bible in there, right?
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.000]   You see submission, women submitting to men,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.880]   and you see the whole idea of slavery.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.800]   So I'm like, okay, so JP is out of town this week.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560]   He's taking his family to Disney World,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.840]   and he's like, "Okay, Greg,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.760]   "I know you've never taught at the porch before,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.960]   "but if you could just cover women submitting to men
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   "and slavery, that'd be great."
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.640]   And he's gonna come back next week,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.760]   and I think he's talking on like prayer.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.880]   I'm like, all right.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.200]   Well played, touche.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.880]   But here's the deal, Paul is talking to the Colossians
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.440]   about authority, and namely the authority
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.760]   that has been placed by God,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.280]   like that has been hard woven into the world,
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.000]   and he gives us three examples.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.280]   He talks about it in a marriage context.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.880]   My wife, Alicia, is here somewhere.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.560]   I imagine we've been married for about 4 1/2 years.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.440]   And really quickly, you just see
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.920]   that God has made us really different, right?
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.000]   There's not necessarily roles and ranks,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.160]   but he has made me, he's given me the role
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.600]   of kinda headship and leadership of our marriage.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.080]   You can just see how he makes us different in those ways.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.440]   The second context he gives us is parenting.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.240]   We have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, a little Cora.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.520]   And again, you just quickly see like the safest place
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   for Cora to be is under our authority.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.120]   Like it is a very, very good thing
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.960]   for there to be authority in Cora's life.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.400]   And sometimes we just have to go,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.800]   baby, you just need to trust me on this one.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.120]   Like I know you don't fully understand,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.720]   but you just need to do it this time because we said so.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.160]   Like it is a very good thing
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.960]   that there's authority in her life.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.360]   And the third context, which we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.480]   is in a slave and master context.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.320]   And before we do that, we have to talk about
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.800]   kinda slavery in the Bible.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   Does the Bible condone slavery?
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.840]   And here's what you need to know about that
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.000]   before we move forward.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.840]   The slavery in the Bible is a very different slavery
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.040]   than what we experience kind of in our nation's history.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.560]   It's not a slavery that's based on race.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.880]   Primarily, it's actually much more based
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.560]   on kind of financial or economic status.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.720]   And so most of the people would actually voluntarily
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.800]   enter into kind of the slave master relationship.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.400]   So it's very, very different.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.320]   And if you think about it, it's very, very similar
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.200]   when you think slave master in the Bible
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.160]   to employee, employer.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.520]   You know, it's very similar to the jobs that we hold today.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.320]   And so that's what we're gonna spend our time
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   talking about tonight is most relevant
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.480]   to kind of our life stage here at The Porch
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.280]   is this kind of employee, employer context.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.960]   And last thing before we dive in, I just wanna say this.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.840]   God is talking about doing everything for his glory,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.520]   and he starts talking about authority.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.680]   And it seems that one way that Paul is saying
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.720]   that we can glorify God is to pay very, very close attentions
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.640]   to the authorities that God has put over us,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.000]   because he puts those over us in his sovereignty.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.280]   That is key to understanding this text
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   that we're gonna cover tonight, all right?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.520]   So let's keep reading, verse 23.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.920]   Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.640]   as working for the Lord, not for human masters.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   Let me say that again.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.240]   Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.640]   as working for the Lord and not for human masters.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.040]   My first point really question tonight,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.800]   who are we working for?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.160]   And I have found, you know, in my heart,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.960]   like two very, very different options
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.200]   when it comes to who I am working for.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.360]   Like I know the scripture, like I see this,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   work for God, I get this, like God is leading me to life.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.040]   But in my flesh, like I have jumped on that roller coaster,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.760]   maybe you guys have too, of working for the applause of man.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.120]   Just like those approvals, I see people shaking their head,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   like we call them attaboys on staff here.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.000]   And maybe you've experienced that, guys,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.960]   but that is just such a terrible way to live, is it not?
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.680]   And it is a roller coaster.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.200]   It's up and down and it's unfulfilling
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.640]   and it's unsatisfying.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.360]   And I just think that God has so much more than that.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.800]   Paul, earlier in his letter to the Galatians,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.160]   wrote it this way.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.640]   He said, "Am I now trying to win the approval
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.240]   "of human beings or of God?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.780]   "Or am I trying to please people?
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.020]   "If I was still trying to please people,
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.160]   "I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.920]   That's Galatians 1:10.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.760]   And here's the deal, guys, like preparing for this message,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.200]   like I've never been up here.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.240]   I don't do this often, I'm sure you can tell.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.960]   But I was doing pretty great, you know?
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.620]   I ran through it actually with JP before he left
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.160]   and that kind of felt like a spanking, honestly,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.000]   but that's okay.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.120]   But today, like I was preparing for this
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.960]   and I was really praying
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.600]   and I just started to get really anxious.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.500]   Like I really wasn't feeling like that,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.160]   but I just started to think, you know, about the people.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   You know, like I don't even know most of you guys,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   but I'm like, I hope you like me, you know?
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.600]   I hope it's good.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.800]   And I'm like, you know, Todd and the elders,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   like they're texting me, like,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.440]   I hope you do great, we're gonna listen in.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.360]   I'm like, what do you mean you're gonna listen in?
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.840]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   And you know, I've got friends here and family here tonight
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.320]   and there's just, there is a huge part of me
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.520]   that longs for your approval, you know?
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.440]   And that, again, that's just a rollercoaster
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.600]   that God invites us off of, you know?
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.160]   And he just says, I can, I have so much more for you
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.600]   than that, Greg, you know?
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.000]   And he just says, live for an audience of one.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   Like, when we work for God, it's so different, you know?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.800]   And if you think about it, like our bosses,
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.920]   they might see, they might not see,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.080]   but like God never misses one act of our love,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.720]   our service, our hard work.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.080]   Like, he doesn't miss a thing.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.640]   He is the one that matters, not the people.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   I have to keep reminding myself of that.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.720]   But here's the deal, like, if we are doing this right,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.320]   like if we are working for God,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.000]   it absolutely means that we submit,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.560]   that we work hard for the authorities
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.280]   that God puts over us, why?
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.840]   Because he is sovereign.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.880]   There is no authority over us
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.240]   that God doesn't intentionally place.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.560]   That's Romans 13, one through two.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.680]   And so if we are serving God, we will serve our boss.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.400]   There was a guy that used to serve here with us.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.420]   We'll call him Carl, Carl.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.560]   Man, that's tough to say, back and forth.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.240]   And so Carl was a really, really sharp guy.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.480]   And he was with an energy company in town,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.520]   and he was kinda young, but he was on the fast track.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.280]   But he was kinda too young for the CFO role,
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   and so they brought a new guy in
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.560]   to be the CFO of his company.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.960]   And very quickly, like from talking to Carl,
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.840]   it was like the new CFO, like he was not gonna cut it.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.240]   Like, he was not connecting well
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.180]   with the people that he was managing,
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.580]   and they were like, man, this guy's gonna be out.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.880]   And sure enough, he did get fired.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.040]   And before he was leaving, like,
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.840]   this is a very smart, educated CFO experience.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.440]   And he sought out my friend Carl, and he just said,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.560]   he said, hey, buddy, I need to ask you a question
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.000]   before I leave, like I'm dying to ask you something.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.160]   And my friend Carl's like, sure, yeah, what is it?
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.120]   And he's like, okay, what did I do differently with you?
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.080]   He's like, what do you mean?
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   He's like, well, you see, I had like nine other people
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.760]   that I was managing, and those relationships,
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.080]   like they were going terrible,
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.760]   but you, like we had something good going there.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   And so like, whatever I was doing with you,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.820]   I need to do more of that in my next job.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.160]   And whatever I was doing with these guys,
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.320]   I should probably not do more of that.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.600]   And he said, he said, oh, okay.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.400]   He said, well, that would be
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.200]   because I don't really work for you.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.960]   And the guy was like, the CFO was like,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.800]   what are you talking about?
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.200]   I'm the CFO, have you seen the org chart?
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.320]   Like, you absolutely work for me.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.680]   He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.600]   He's like, you don't understand.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.640]   He's like, I'm a Christian, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.000]   And so even though you were doing the same things,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   like you were doing all those things
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.440]   you were doing over here,
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   like you were doing those here,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.980]   but I wasn't serving you.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.440]   Like I was serving my Father in heaven,
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.040]   and he commands me to serve the authorities
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.880]   that are over me.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.240]   And so I was serving him.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.380]   And yeah, I was serving you,
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.760]   but it was 'cause my eyes were focused on the Lord.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.720]   We work for God.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.920]   Next verse, verse 24.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.760]   Since you know that you will receive an inheritance
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.160]   from the Lord as a reward,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.000]   it is the Lord Christ you are serving.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.320]   My second question tonight, what are we working for?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.160]   Again, I feel this pull in my heart.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.480]   If I can be honest, I hope we always can here.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.040]   I feel the desire to have more money.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.760]   If you can imagine people at a church,
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.720]   we don't make a ton of money.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.040]   But I just feel the desire for more,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.240]   just a little bit more.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.840]   What if we could have just a nicer car?
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.360]   What if we could do some upgrades to our house?
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.720]   If we could travel somewhere awesome this summer?
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.560]   What if I could just have a little bit more money?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.600]   Or honestly, more than that,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.320]   what I'm more susceptible to
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   is just that I would work for a sense of worth.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.040]   A sense of value and identity.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.720]   I'm truly working to be somebody.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.960]   I wanna promote myself.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.680]   I wanna feel like I'm making a name for myself.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.440]   You ever feel that way?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.040]   The American dream, a sense of accomplishment.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.000]   In the same way, I just think God invites us
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.600]   into so much more than that.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.120]   Not that that's necessarily wrong,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.920]   but God has more for us.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.880]   This is a crazy idea, and it's so biblical,
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.280]   that we are going to receive an inheritance
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.680]   from the Lord as a reward.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.600]   What does that mean?
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.000]   The ways that we work in our job today, tomorrow,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.520]   we are storing up a reward.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.280]   If we are a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.640]   if we are a believer in him,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.280]   we are storing up rewards that are so much bigger
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.360]   than even this world, bigger than us,
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.760]   bigger than our bosses.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   Jesus said it like this in Matthew 6.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.680]   He said, "Do not store up for yourselves
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.000]   "treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.040]   "where thieves break in and steal,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.680]   "but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.960]   "where moth and rust do not destroy,
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.000]   "where thieves do not break in and steal."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.520]   You see, we are invited to work for so much more,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.920]   things that will matter forever and ever.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.200]   We work for his rewards, we work for God.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.080]   Verse 25, "Anyone who does wrong
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.520]   "will be repaid for their wrongs,
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   "for there's no favoritism.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.580]   "Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair,
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.600]   "because you know that you also have a master in heaven."
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.280]   My third question tonight, how are we to work?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.440]   What does this look like for us to apply this,
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.720]   for us to live this out?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.880]   First and foremost, it means that we work hard.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.000]   Verse 23, "Work with all of your heart."
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.560]   We know that work is good, right?
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.120]   Like work was in the garden before the fall happened,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.880]   like work was a good thing.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.040]   And then we also know that because of the fall
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.880]   in Genesis 3, work is going to be hard.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.000]   Like it is a promise from God
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.720]   that our jobs are going to be difficult.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.640]   It's going to be a painful toil, the scripture says.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.880]   And here's the deal, I don't know how to
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.680]   kind of sugarcoat this, but if you pay attention
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.160]   to like what historians and people that study generations
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.040]   are saying about us, millennials,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.880]   those of us in our 20s and 30s, in regards to our work,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.320]   like it's not pretty, here's what they're saying.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.120]   We are known for being uncommitted.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.160]   We're known for being flaky, for not respecting authority.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.440]   We are staying at our jobs for the least amount of time
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.780]   as a generation compared to any other that's come before us.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.780]   You see, we wanna change the world,
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.360]   but we are unwilling to put in the long,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.480]   hard work that is required.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.840]   That's what they're saying about us.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.080]   Recently, our staff, we got to hear from Gary Haugen.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.420]   You guys know Gary Haugen, IJM?
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.000]   Maybe not, let me tell you about him.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.320]   IJM is an unbelievable organization.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.920]   They're based in Washington, DC.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.720]   And what they do is they partner with third world
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.360]   governments and kind of local police authorities.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.980]   And they go in and rescue women and children
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.660]   who are being held as sex slaves
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.000]   in the sex trafficking industry, unbelievable evil.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.020]   And he came and spoke to our staff,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.900]   and they were on the heels of this huge,
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.700]   unbelievable rescue, I believe it was in Cambodia,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.220]   where they had freed all these women and children.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.780]   And he just said, "Hey guys, can you imagine
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.120]   "like how many millions of people would love to serve
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.060]   "on my staff that day?"
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.380]   You know, it's like SEAL Team Six type stuff.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.780]   Like they're going in there, they're getting the bad guys,
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.140]   they're giving them justice,
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.740]   they're getting the women and the children,
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.900]   they're pulling them out of this awful evil,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.700]   and they're sharing the gospel with them.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.760]   They're helping them be restored and recover
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.940]   from this miserable life that they've been in.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.740]   He just said, "Can you imagine how many millions
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.920]   "of people would love to be on our staff that day?"
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.940]   But he just said, "Here's what people don't understand."
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.820]   Nobody gets this.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.000]   He said, "There were tens of thousands of hours
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.100]   "put in on the front end.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.980]   "Like before this day could happen,
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.900]   "there were long days, tens of thousands of hours
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.420]   "of hard work."
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.260]   What does that mean?
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.180]   Like we would fly into nowheresville, Africa or Asia.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.380]   We would drive all day, all night to a quote unquote court
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.300]   that just didn't really happen to kind of meet that day.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.340]   And we would try again.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.340]   I mean, long, long hours.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.700]   And he just said, "Do you know how many people
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.380]   "they wanna be on my staff that day?"
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.280]   He said, "Man, it's just a few.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.060]   "It's just a few."
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.300]   You see, our generation, we forget the importance
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.700]   of just simple faithfulness, like long obedience
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.080]   in the same direction, faithfulness.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.960]   Number two, it means we work with excellence, right?
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.980]   If we're working for God, it means we work for excellence.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.080]   We've said here before,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.100]   excellence honors God and inspires people, right?
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.980]   And if we're not at our jobs working with excellence,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.580]   then we're not gonna really have credibility.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.760]   Like people aren't gonna trust us.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.180]   It's like, "Yeah, hello, I'd like to invite you
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.020]   "to the porch.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.540]   "It's this thing that I go to on Tuesday nights."
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.620]   And they're like, "Yeah, is it as awesome
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.040]   "as you are at our job?
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.880]   "No, thank you."
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.140]   It's like, I was actually gonna invite you to join our team
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.460]   and do some work around here, right?
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.700]   I mean, it's like, it's not gonna happen.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.020]   Like we're not gonna have the credibility that we want to.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.360]   We work with excellence.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.940]   Number three, we work for God.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.800]   We work like he will tell you face to face how you did
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.780]   because he will.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.640]   It's a crazy idea.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.920]   We work for his rewards.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.280]   We've talked about this.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   And here's the deal.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.760]   Like if God is the one who sees and knows everything,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   like he doesn't miss anything.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.760]   And if he's the one who hands out the rewards,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.840]   then why are we so worried about man, right?
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.460]   They can't even give us something
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.080]   that it's not even theirs to give.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.960]   God is the one who doles out the rewards.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.980]   There's no favoritism.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.760]   Like the scales, the scales are absolutely equal.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.280]   Number five, it means we do the right thing
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.040]   regardless of who's watching, of who it's for.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.800]   Like we do the right thing.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   Lastly, for those of us who are entrusted
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.200]   with leadership, verse one,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.120]   "Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.480]   "because you know that you also have a master in heaven."
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.760]   What does this mean?
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.240]   It means that if we're the quote unquote master
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.640]   in the story, it means that we will face
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.540]   our true master one day, right?
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.200]   And so the ways that we are fair and just and kind
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   to our employees, like we will be accountable
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.760]   before the true master one day.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.520]   The quote unquote masters have a master as well.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.400]   Before I came on staff at Watermark,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.480]   I worked for about nine years or so
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.640]   in the business world, kind of finance and private equity.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.360]   And for about five of those years,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.240]   I worked for a very, very godly man.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.060]   And he also happened to be unbelievably wealthy,
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   like billionaire with a B, like big time money.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.800]   And when you have that kind of money, I learned,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.680]   you have a lot of people to help take care of that money.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.280]   You know, and you have banks and people help you
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.780]   with your investing and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.800]   And so we decided to take all of those people
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.400]   that kind of helped with investments
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.640]   and all that kind of stuff out of town for a weekend
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.240]   to his ranch that he owned.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.640]   And the goal was just like, let's get to know these people.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.880]   We're working closely with them.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   They're serving us.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.360]   Like, let's spend some time together.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   And also we were gonna just kind of update them
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.980]   on the business, what was going on,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.800]   and just some of our needs that we might be having
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.320]   over the next six months.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.800]   And here's the deal.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.760]   Like, I was over this event
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.100]   and we got to just like roll out the red carpet.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.840]   I mean, it was like a five star event.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.420]   We had private planes that we got to fly people
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.120]   into the ranch on.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.920]   We served like these unbelievable meals,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.340]   like steaks from deer that had been killed out at the ranch.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.280]   I mean, it was like amazing.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.520]   And these people that were coming out,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.160]   I mean, they're like the CEOs of local banks
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   and that kind of stuff,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.820]   kind of the big wigs, if you will.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.160]   And we had an unbelievable time.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.960]   And throughout the weekend,
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.080]   people kind of knew that I was over the event.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.320]   And they're like, man, this is so fun.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.380]   Like, you're doing a great job.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.220]   Thank you.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.520]   I see the ways you're working hard.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.760]   And I just wanna thank you, man.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.640]   We're having a blast.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.440]   And so it was awesome.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.180]   And we're like done.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.980]   Like, we're almost there, 11th hour.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.100]   We're outside of the house.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.720]   All the cars are kind of lined up,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.280]   the rental cars to take everybody to the airport.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.640]   And I mean, we are like there.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.960]   And there's one truck that's kind of out of order
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   and would have kind of prohibited everybody else
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.840]   from driving to the airport.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.800]   And so I saw that.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.000]   I noticed it was also the owner's truck.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.400]   And I was like, but let me, I'll just move it around.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.720]   I'll kind of loop it around the corner.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.200]   And that way everybody can get to the airport.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.720]   So I get in that car, I slam it into drive.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.020]   I look and I see a car and I see the house,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.060]   but I'm like, surely that's plenty of room for me
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.740]   to just kind of drive right through there.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.140]   And so I do do that.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.420]   And it was like,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.140]   (imitates siren)
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.980]   like all across the house.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.780]   And I was like, oh man, I was so close.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.740]   And I, and so I kept driving and I pulled the car
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.260]   around the rest of the cars.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.800]   And I put it in park and then I get to do the walk of shame.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.120]   You know, like everybody's outside and they're like,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.520]   oh my goodness.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.900]   And you could see in their eyes, you know,
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.720]   they're like, why did you do that?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.400]   Like he was going so well, you know, like,
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.460]   why, oh, why couldn't you just finish it?
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.300]   You know?
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.120]   And I was feeling the same thing.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.600]   And, and so I'm like walking up and the owner,
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.320]   like he comes out of the crowd, you know,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.400]   all these people watching.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.040]   I'm like, oh, I snap into like,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.440]   hey, don't worry about that truck.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   Like I will fix that truck the next time
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.820]   you come out to this ranch, that truck will be perfect.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.480]   I will wax it myself, fix it, it's going to be amazing.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.500]   And he just, I'll never forget this for the rest of my life.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.120]   He put his arm around me and he said, Greg,
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.260]   he said, you have worked so hard this weekend.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.040]   Like, this has been such a blast.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.600]   This has been amazing.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.960]   Like I've seen your work.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.440]   He said, you're not fixing that truck, man.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.800]   And he said, you know what else?
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.240]   He said, I'm not even fixing that truck.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.080]   Why not?
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.360]   Because it will serve as a reminder for me
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.080]   for the rest of my life, for the hard work
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.120]   that you put into this event.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.940]   Like this will be a trophy.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.420]   I will always remember you when I look at this truck.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.640]   And to my knowledge, like the truck hasn't been fixed since.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.300]   And here's the deal, like I will never,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.520]   I will never forget that story, you know,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.440]   of the ways that that master treated me, his slave.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.520]   And even more important, like I'm confident
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.960]   that the real master will not forget the ways
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.080]   with which that master treated me.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.660]   Unbelievable grace and unbelievable kindness.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.520]   In conclusion, who do we work for?
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.880]   Colossians 3 says we work for God.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   He is the boss.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.100]   Colossians 3 says we work for rewards from him,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.420]   things that are so much greater
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.200]   than anything this world has to offer.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   Colossians 3 says we work like he's watching
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.720]   because he is, he is.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.800]   And he not only hands out the rewards,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.480]   but he repays evil to those who do wrong to us.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.640]   There's no favoritism, the scales are even.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.560]   And here's what I absolutely love about this idea.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.080]   Like if we work this way, like if we work hard,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.640]   if we work for God, if we're working for greater things,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.980]   if we're worshiping God truly through our work,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.640]   like can we really be in the wrong place?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.960]   You know, like we get so paranoid.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.500]   It's like, what is God's will for me?
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.120]   Is it job A or is it job B?
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.440]   Like, is God gonna speak to me and tell me it's job A?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.960]   Like, I don't know, you know,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.640]   but we get so paranoid about, am I in the right place?
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.300]   I've been like this for so much of my life.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.920]   But here's the deal, if we are working this way,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.480]   we're gonna be in the right place, right?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.500]   We are gonna be honoring the Lord in our work,
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.040]   and that's what matters.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.920]   You see, it's not what you do that matters,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.560]   but how and why.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.820]   It's not what you do that matters, but how and why.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.820]   Verse 17, whatever you do, verse 23, whatever you do.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.520]   You see, we don't need to necessarily
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.860]   do something different tomorrow.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.140]   We probably just need to do
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.420]   the very same thing differently.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.220]   We don't need to do, we don't need a new job.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.600]   We need to do the job that we had today
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.220]   and that we're gonna have tomorrow.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.380]   We need to do that differently.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.320]   Let me close with a story, a friend of mine
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.800]   who just honestly got this right.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.360]   It was one of our volunteers, Jeremy.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.720]   And Jeremy was a sharp guy,
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.480]   but he didn't have this unbelievable job,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.320]   you know what I mean?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.560]   It wasn't some sexy industry,
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.000]   and he'd be like, whoa, that's awesome.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.120]   But here's the deal, he viewed his job as his ministry.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.440]   He would always talk like that.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.840]   And I was like, oh, that's cool.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.640]   And so he would always talk about the relationships
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.480]   that he was building with the people that he worked with.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.640]   And he was good at what he did.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.840]   He would always get invited on these sales incentive trips.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.800]   I remember 'cause he was single and I was single,
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.600]   and I was always like, are you gonna invite me
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.880]   to go on that Mexico trip with you?
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.720]   That'd be awesome.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.540]   He never did.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.480]   But here's the deal, the guy loved people well.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.040]   He was building relationships, he was working hard,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.000]   and he would just go, man, that job,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.200]   it might be a random job, but it is my ministry.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.080]   And there was one particular time,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.120]   we were driving down 75, I still remember it.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.760]   It was the weekend, we were going to lunch in Uptown,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.240]   and his cell phone rang, and it was a random number.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.080]   And he's like, oh, I'll get it.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.960]   And on the other end was a coworker, a middle-aged woman.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   And she just said, hey, Jeremy,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.280]   I didn't know who else to call.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.560]   I just found my husband dead.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.920]   And I have no idea where to turn or what to do,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.800]   but I thought about you.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.080]   Like, you seem different, and so do you have any,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.640]   like, what do I do, what do I do next?
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.040]   You see, Jeremy had earned the right
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.640]   to speak into this woman's life.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.880]   Like, he barely even knew her,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.000]   but there was something about the ways
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.520]   that he worshiped his God, the ways that he worked,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.560]   that the first person that she thought of was Jeremy.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.080]   And she didn't have a faith, she didn't have a church home,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.240]   and we got to minister to this family
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.840]   in an unbelievable way.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.800]   We got to do the service here at Watermark,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.360]   and she's been coming here, and her son was a young adult.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.000]   He's been coming here to the porch,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.040]   and we've got to minister to him.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.200]   I think what I want you to know tonight
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.320]   is that God has so much more for our jobs.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.360]   Like, if we work this way,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.240]   like, there is so much greater life and purpose.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.760]   It is so much more rewarding.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   Like, the American dream, the Dallas dream,
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.160]   the people chase, money and status and success,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.200]   like, it's empty.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.760]   Like, some of you have experienced it,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.200]   and you're like, I know, like, it is empty.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.920]   And God has things that are so much bigger
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.680]   and so much better.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.280]   I pray that we would pursue him,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.440]   that we would not worship our work,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.240]   but we would worship God through our work.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.320]   We pray that we would.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:52.520]   Father, I thank you for your word, Lord,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.880]   and just the ways that you instruct us to life, Lord,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.040]   and not that you're trying to withhold good things
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.880]   from us, but that you have so much more for us, Lord.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.640]   And specifically in our work, Lord,
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.680]   I don't know where everybody is at,
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.760]   but I doubt we're in our dream jobs, Lord.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.800]   I pray that we would find purpose in working for you.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.920]   Lord, I pray that we would work hard.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.040]   I pray that we would not work
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.840]   for just the temporary fleeting trinkets of this world,
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.280]   that we would work for you.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.360]   We would have the next life on our mind.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.080]   You say there are rewards
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.960]   and an inheritance waiting for us on the other side.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.240]   Father, help us not to settle.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.840]   Lord, I just pray that we would leave here tonight
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.840]   just on fire for the mission that you've put before us.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.920]   Not that we would worship our work,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.600]   but they would worship you through our work.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.960]   I pray all this in Christ's name, amen.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
