[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.440]   How are we?
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.480]   Oh man, okay.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   Hey, let's thank these guys for leading us.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.400]   Fort Worth, I know you have Jared Rutzel.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.200]   Houston, I don't know who you're worshiping to,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800]   but man, worship leaders just stir our affections for Jesus.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.440]   It's fun to come into this place
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   and sing love songs to God wherever you're at.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.240]   If you're tuning in somewhere, streaming,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.900]   we hope that you're worshiping with us,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.840]   if not through song, as we open God's word.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.520]   And so I want you to turn to Judges 11.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   If you have your Bible, if you don't have a Bible
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.480]   or own a Bible, we'll give you a Bible free this evening.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.640]   You can pull out your phones and turn there
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.120]   on your phones or device or whatever that looks like.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   Judges 11, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.360]   Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, chapter 11.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.440]   I'm gonna open tonight with a crazy story.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.520]   We're gonna talk about Jephthah.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.560]   And so who can tell me some things about Jephthah?
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.960]   Okay, not a lot of hands, okay?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.440]   I didn't see one actually.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.000]   And so this story that I'm about to tell you,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.720]   you may have never heard it preached in your entire life.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.400]   You probably have never heard this story.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.320]   And I read it this week and I was just like,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.480]   that's a crazy story, why is that in our Bibles?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.440]   And so I just wanna turn there with you.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   And so let me set this up, Jephthah, he's a gang leader.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800]   Okay, true story.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   He was, his dad was married and he had some brothers,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   but his dad slept with a prostitute.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.720]   The prostitute got pregnant and had Jephthah.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.520]   And so he's this illegitimate child of this man
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.600]   and he goes into the home, the brothers kick him out,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.320]   throw him on the streets, he goes on the streets,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.800]   he starts gang banging.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.880]   And so he's like a blood or a crip or something.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.400]   And the Israelites, just to set the scene,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.480]   God's people are under attack from other nations.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.160]   Specifically, there's this really powerful nation
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   called the Ammonites.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.040]   And they're after God's people, they're after God's land.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.440]   And they're just getting their tails handed to them
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960]   and they're like, what are we gonna do?
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.240]   You know what, we're gonna go after that bad,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.000]   bad gang leader, Jephthah, who we threw out.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.960]   And let's see if he can lead us into victory.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.600]   And so this has been going on.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.400]   And so Jephthah kind of enters the scene.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.800]   He's like, hey, but you guys rejected me.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.440]   They're like, we know, but if you'll come
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.160]   and you'll lead us to fight this army, the Ammonites,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.060]   you know, we'll take you back and you can be a part of us.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.440]   And he's like, okay, maybe so.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.200]   And so Jephthah kind of enters the picture
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.320]   and Jephthah reaches out to the Ammonite king
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.180]   and just says, hey, why do you wanna fight with us?
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.600]   And he says, well, because you took our land.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720]   And he goes, no, we didn't.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   God gave us this land.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.160]   And by the way, that was 300 years ago.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.500]   And why have you been silent for 300 years?
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.360]   And the guy basically says, shut up, it's my land,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.520]   let's make war.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.840]   That's the message version.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.280]   And so here's where we're at.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.680]   And I'm gonna start here in verse 29.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.320]   Let me go, okay.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.280]   So verse 29, chapter 11, verse 29.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   "Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.540]   "He crossed Gilead and Manasseh,
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.560]   "passed through Mizpah of Gilead,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.260]   "and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.400]   "And Jephthah," listen, "made a vow to the Lord.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   "If you give the Ammonites into my hands,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.840]   "whatever comes out of the door of my house
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.960]   "to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.600]   "will be the Lord's, and I will sacrifice it
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.060]   "as a burnt offering."
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.460]   Anybody have a pet here, a puppy?
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.040]   Specifically a puppy.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.240]   Cats are hardly pets.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.600]   But if you have, anybody?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.020]   Raise your hand high if you have a puppy.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.320]   Okay, and so if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.080]   find somebody with their hand up afterwards
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.900]   and you can ask them.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.880]   When you guys go out of town, right,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.260]   and then you come back, you've been gone for a week,
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.960]   maybe you sent the puppy to the kennel or to a friend,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   you come back, like, hey, you know,
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.800]   it's like, let's play, where have you been?
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.400]   Come on, I missed you, you know, right?
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.760]   Am I alone on this, right?
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.080]   That happens, if you raise your hand, just lie for me.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.660]   Okay, and so he's saying, hey, when I come back to battle,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.600]   I don't know if he had a bunch of chickens or goats
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.000]   or what was hanging out in his house,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.840]   but he says, hey, whatever comes out,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.480]   I'll sacrifice as a burnt offering
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.100]   if you'll give me victory.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.960]   He makes that commitment to the Lord.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.040]   Then Jephthah, verse 32, went over to fight the Ammonites
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.360]   and the Lord gave them into his hands.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.440]   He wins, and it goes on to verse 33.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   It says he doesn't just win, he dominates them.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.140]   He conquers the land around them.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.200]   Verse 34, when Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.400]   who should come out to meet him but his daughter,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.280]   dancing to the sound of timbrels?
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.640]   She was an only child.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   Except for her, he had neither son nor daughter.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.980]   And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and he cried,
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.360]   oh no, my daughter, you have brought me down
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.600]   and I am devastated.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.400]   I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.440]   This is crazy.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.040]   He says, hey God, whatever comes out to greet me
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.480]   when I get home, I will offer as a burnt sacrifice to you.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   He comes home and it's his only child,
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.500]   his only daughter comes out to him.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.560]   And if you think that's crazy, it just gets crazier.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.200]   How she responds, 'cause I'd be like, oh no, psych.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.920]   My father, she replied,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.120]   you have given your word to the Lord.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.280]   Do to me as you promised.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.440]   Now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.700]   the Ammonites, but grant me this one request, she said,
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.960]   give me two months to roam the hills and weep
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.180]   with my friends because I will never marry.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.400]   Now some of you girls are like, that just makes sense.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.440]   You know, she'd be sad.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.720]   He may go, you may go, he said.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   And he let her go for two months.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.960]   She and her friends went into the hills and wept
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.240]   because she would never marry.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.000]   After the two months, she returned to her father
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and he did to her as he had vowed, and she was a virgin,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.600]   which is a weird thing to add.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.120]   Some commentaries believe that she was just then
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000]   given to celibacy.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.880]   Others would say, no, he offered her as a burnt offering.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.320]   The sad thing tonight is you guys are probably wrestling
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   with what's worse, you know, with celibacy
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.440]   or the burnt offering, I don't know.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.000]   And so I wanna tell you where I stand.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.540]   I think he did as he promised.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.760]   And when you read that, and I'm not saying it was right,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.800]   and I'm not condoning the decision,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.540]   I'm just saying it happened, okay?
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.960]   So listen, I'm not, you know, the application not is like,
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   hey, offer a burnt offering to the Lord, no.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.360]   But why, when I read that, I'm like,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   why did he go through with it?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.800]   I think when you read it, if you were honest,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.560]   like the first thing you think is like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.080]   Tell God, like God will like change your mind.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.840]   Why did he go through with this?
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.760]   But I want you to understand something.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.740]   And the reason I tell you this crazy story this evening
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.080]   is because in the ancient world,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.960]   they would not have asked why did he go through with it?
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.280]   They would have asked, why did he make the vow?
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.400]   We know why he went through with it,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   because you keep your word.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.400]   The culture, listen closely,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.960]   the culture of which the Bible was written into
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.720]   was a culture where your word mattered more than anything.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.640]   You did what you said you were going to do.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.460]   And so while we read it and we're like,
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.800]   why did he go through with it?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   They read it and they're like,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.440]   man, he shouldn't have made that promise.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.280]   That was dumb.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.980]   But we know why he went through with it, assuming he did.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.940]   Because in this culture, you keep your word.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.880]   That's the culture that the Bible is written into.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.760]   And Jephthah knew the scriptures.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.120]   He knew the Torah.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.480]   He knew the law and he understood that God really cares
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.160]   about people keeping their commitments.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.000]   Now he had a messed up view of it
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.320]   and he needed some accountability
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.580]   and some community to come in and say,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.600]   hey, God's got a grace and here's the deal.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   He probably doesn't want you to kill your daughter.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.720]   And by the way, that's against the law in and of itself.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.240]   But that's a sermon for another time.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.180]   And so the reason I say that is so that you have
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.320]   a great understanding of the culture
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.280]   of which the Bible is written into,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.540]   because we don't err to that side.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.440]   We're not like keeping crazy promises.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.680]   Like we don't even keep really basic ones.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.000]   In fact, not only do we not keep them,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.280]   we don't even wanna make them.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.880]   Like we struggle just to make commitments.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.840]   Like some of you guys, I'll just pick on you for a moment,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   probably all evening.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   Some of you guys, it's like, you know, as I said before,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   you've been dating a girl for a long, long time, like years.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.480]   You're like, I don't know, man, I can't take that step.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.560]   And then others of you are like, yeah,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.100]   like engagements off the table,
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.920]   you can't even ask a girl out.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.580]   Like that's too much of a commitment for you,
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.120]   amen, ladies?
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.960]   Okay.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.480]   Okay, and now guys, before you walk out, okay,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   I see you already like planning your exit.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.360]   Before you do, let me just say, man, I was the same way.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.320]   I was absolutely the same way.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.960]   I was dating this girl that was graduating from Baylor,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   and I needed to get her a graduation gift,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.920]   and I was like, oh man, I'll get an engagement ring.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.360]   Like that'll go well, like she'll love that, you know?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.300]   And then, and then to make matters worse,
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.020]   I got her a set of golf clubs
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.700]   just in case I changed my mind.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.780]   So I travel, true story, I travel to Baylor,
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.220]   I travel to Waco with an engagement ring
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.940]   and a set of women's golf clubs in the back.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.980]   And I get there and she walks across the stage,
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.060]   and you know what's crazy, you know what happened?
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.060]   I changed my mind.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.860]   It's like, here's some golf clubs, I hope you like 'em.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.780]   And we'll go golfing together, it's gonna be great.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.900]   And so I changed my mind.
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.100]   So you know what I did, I sold the wedding ring.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.260]   I came back to Dallas, I worked with this guy,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.100]   he was looking for an engagement ring,
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.140]   he's like, oh man, God's providence, I have one here.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.460]   And I sell it to him, okay?
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.220]   He calls off the engagement, 'cause he's flaky too,
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.620]   and then I buy the wedding ring back.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.720]   And then I just carry it in my pocket,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.620]   just looking for the right time.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.500]   Just like a flippant decision, like I don't know,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.900]   like maybe today's the day, on a date at Dairy Queen.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.100]   No, probably not.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.900]   But one day, one day we're on a date,
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.500]   we're on a date at dinner, and it had gone well,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.020]   it was a good conversation.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.100]   I was like, hmm, okay.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.500]   I go, I grab the ring, I come back, I give it to the waiter,
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.180]   I'm like, bring it out for dessert.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.140]   He does, I get on a knee, I'm like, will you marry me?
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.980]   She's like, yes.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.860]   It looked to her like it was this grand, you know,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.540]   planned proposal.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.420]   It was a decision I had made about 37 seconds earlier.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.420]   And when I tell people that,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.180]   they usually respond the same way.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.820]   Poor Monica.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.340]   Because I wasn't a man of commitment.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.980]   Like I was flaky and flippant,
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.900]   and kind of following the Spirit,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.340]   and God, where's the open door, and speak to me,
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.180]   and let me walk through that.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.500]   And it just kind of marked my life, this flippancy,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   and honestly, I had carried that into the marriage,
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.260]   because as I stood there, like honestly, I thought,
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.180]   hey, we'll be engaged for like four years.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.780]   Her dad had other plans,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.580]   and so we get married four months later,
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.060]   and, yeah, wow.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.820]   And I just thought, like here's honestly
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.620]   what's going through my mind.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.980]   I just thought, yeah, man, we'll do that.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.220]   We'll give that a shot.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.900]   If it doesn't, you know, divorce, be a statistic.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.340]   I mean, most people are, and it's okay.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.180]   It's okay, this just marked kind of the,
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.500]   in the back of my mind, I thought,
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.580]   hey, we'll give this a shot,
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.860]   and if it doesn't work, we'll undo this.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.140]   I didn't have the conviction of Jethro.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.180]   I wasn't like, no, no, whatever I say,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.540]   like I'm gonna do that.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.740]   And we are so submersed in this culture.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.500]   Like some of you, if you were honest,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.260]   that's the way that you view commitments,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.060]   which is a covenant like marriage,
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.420]   and not just marriage, but other commitments that you make.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.380]   Think it's not a big deal.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.140]   Like if something comes up, my friends will understand.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.220]   And that is inconsistent with being a follower of Christ.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.940]   Like spontaneity is cute,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.300]   but so are pigtails and babies and things like that,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.300]   and they're not consistent with mature adulting, if you will.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.420]   And so we're in this series, Adulting.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.380]   We're talking about what it looks like to grow up.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.620]   Welcome to the real world.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.020]   And tonight, we're talking about keeping commitments.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.820]   Keeping commitments.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.580]   And so we're gonna dive right in from there.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:42.420]   This is usually where I give you some stats
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.180]   and just kinda tell you about how awful we are at this.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.900]   I was looking at the stats, I got too depressed,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.700]   and so I'll just summarize them for you.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.140]   We don't commit to marriage.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.420]   That is, we don't propose, and then when we do, we end it.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.500]   We don't commit to work.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.820]   We don't commit to church,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   and we don't commit to following Christ.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.280]   More than any other generation
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.900]   that has ever walked the planet, we are the least committal.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.220]   Higher divorce rates, lower engagements rates.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.100]   We change jobs like underwear.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.180]   This is the things that mark us, okay?
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.980]   And I'm not trying to beat you up,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.700]   but tonight, before you leave,
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.580]   I want you to have a biblical understanding
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.860]   of what God desires for you as it relates to commitment
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.620]   because he really, really, really cares.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.980]   It's really important.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.500]   And so let's just start this evening
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.060]   by talking about why don't we keep commitments as adults.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.340]   We'll just ask that question.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.780]   Why don't we keep commitments?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.620]   What are the reasons that we don't keep commitments?
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.980]   And the first one that I'll cover
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.700]   is I think because we're overcommitted.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.860]   We've filled our lives with things that don't matter.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.980]   Let me say it in a different way.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.300]   We've filled our lives
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.780]   with things of no eternal significance
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.660]   so that when something of eternal significance,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.820]   something that exists within our purpose of existence
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.740]   comes along, we're too busy for it.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.380]   We are overprogrammed.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.420]   We are too committed to the same routines of sin,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.340]   the same routines and patterns of going out
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.460]   and coming in and conversing
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.580]   that we're stuck in this cycle
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.700]   that is robbing us of creativity
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.540]   and robbing us of real joy
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.740]   and robbing our lives of real meaning
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.120]   so that when something that God calls us to comes along,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.720]   we just don't have time for it.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.380]   It doesn't sound interesting
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.700]   compared to all of the other things.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.580]   Ephesians chapter five, verses 15 and 17 says,
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.540]   "Be careful then how you live,
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.940]   "not as unwise but as wise,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.100]   "making the most of every opportunity,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.820]   "seizing the right opportunities
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.280]   "because the days are evil.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.660]   "Therefore, do not be foolish
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.760]   "but understand what the Lord's will is.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.020]   "Commit to the things that are within the Lord's will.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.380]   "Do not, do not weigh your life down
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.140]   "with things and patterns and cycles
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.840]   "that are not within the Lord's will,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.360]   "robbing yourself of creativity,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.780]   "doing the same thing over and over and over
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.460]   "and thinking that it's life."
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.860]   The second reason I think that we don't keep commitments
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.860]   is because better options come along,
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.380]   because better options come along.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.100]   You've probably heard of #FOMO,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   which is just the fear of missing out.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.140]   It actually started as FOBO,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.780]   or the fear of a better option,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.540]   and slowly became FOMO.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.540]   And so here's the deal is we kinda go through life
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.260]   wondering and being afraid of what we're gonna miss out on,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.420]   and I just wanna free you from that.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.640]   Like, hear me on this.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.080]   Like, if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.740]   you get heaven, you miss out on nothing.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.000]   Your life is short but of vapor, the word says.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.980]   And 200 years from now, no one's like,
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.540]   oh, but I never saw the Grand Canyon.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.220]   You know, it's like, God's like,
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.980]   oh, you wanna see the Grand, here, the Grand, you know.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.020]   That just doesn't happen.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.180]   No one's like, oh, but I never got married.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.780]   I never experienced sex.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.420]   Nobody's saying that in heaven, okay?
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.220]   Nobody's like, yeah, but that one time,
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.200]   you know, I didn't get to go see the better movie
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.860]   'cause I'd committed to the lesser better movie
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.500]   with the other friend, and the friend that I really,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.060]   and nobody's saying that.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.260]   It's silly, and it's robbing you of life.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.300]   And so do what is the most loving to others.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.460]   Make commitments and keep them regardless.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.780]   Period.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.740]   Something comes along, check your calendar.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.380]   If you can do it, and if it will be loving,
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.300]   say, I will do it.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.380]   Not yes, maybe, probably, might, possibly.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.740]   I'm in.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.620]   I give you my word.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.180]   I'll keep my commitment even if it hurts.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.420]   I'm gonna give you two scriptures.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.020]   Philippians 2, verse three says,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.620]   do nothing out of selfish ambition or vacancy,
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.140]   rather, in humility, value others above yourselves.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.340]   There is no FOMO in that.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.460]   Value others better than yourselves.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.060]   If we just did that, imagine how much
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.080]   of a better place our world would be.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.220]   If you went to work tomorrow, and you just began to think,
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.620]   hey, I'm gonna stop thinking about myself,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.740]   and I'm gonna start thinking about others,
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.260]   and I'm gonna do whatever, in any given situation,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.620]   whatever's the most loving.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.180]   Not what is selfish.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.540]   And then let me give you one that I love
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.460]   in talking about this.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.380]   It's Psalm 15.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.980]   It's Psalm 15, and it just starts out,
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.860]   Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent?
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.340]   Who may live on your holy mountain?
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.580]   That's how the Psalm starts,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.020]   and it answers the question in verse four.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.940]   It says, the one who keeps an oath,
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.740]   even when it hurts, and does not change their mind.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.140]   Who can be with you, God, forever and ever,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.220]   in your kingdom?
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.400]   The one who keeps an oath.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.220]   The one who keeps a commitment, even when it hurts,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.660]   and does not change their mind.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.460]   There's no FOMO in that.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.060]   There's no, but yeah, but my friend Kathy came along
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.420]   with a better movie, and it was a better option.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.640]   It was a better dance, better date.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.440]   There's none of that in that verse.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.620]   The third reason I think that we don't keep commitments
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.280]   is we don't value our word.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.420]   There's no value in what we say.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.360]   We say silly things when we don't mean it.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.900]   You know, it was, I heard a guy on the radio the other day
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.100]   say, he was talking about Denzel Washington,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.180]   and he said, he literally set the screen on fire.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.140]   I'm like, no he didn't.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.340]   You can't say literally, and then say whatever you want.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.800]   Like, that word means something.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.820]   And we do that.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.020]   We're like, I promise, it was the best meal I had ever had.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.180]   Really, I mean, really?
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.380]   Like, you promise?
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.380]   Like, to be honest with you, oh, here comes a lie.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.820]   Right, I mean, we say these things,
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.460]   they're just kinda tag-ons.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   I love the way the Lord just provides illustrations.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.740]   I came home for dinner last night,
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.140]   and I had walked in, and my daughter Finley, she's six,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.940]   she's so upset about something, I don't know what.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.060]   And she just goes, Daddy, Kyle lied to me.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.380]   Daddy, Kyle lied to me.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.220]   Kyle lied to me.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.380]   And I was like, getting a meal.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.140]   I wasn't ignoring her on purpose,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.060]   but I could tell something was building up,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.940]   and so I kinda made my plate, and I sat down,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.020]   and she goes, Daddy, Kyle lied to me.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.140]   This time, tears welling up in her eyes,
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.100]   and I said, Finley bear, what, what, what happened?
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.460]   And she just said, Daddy, Kyle said
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.620]   that he would play with me on Friday.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.820]   He said on Monday that he would play with me,
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.020]   and he didn't.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.420]   I said, oh, baby girl, I'm sorry, what did he do?
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.900]   He played gaga ball.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.140]   I'm like, well, have you ever played gaga ball?
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.580]   I mean, it's pretty fun, no, I didn't say that.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.340]   I go, I said, oh, baby girl, I'm sorry,
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.940]   and then I go, how did that make you feel?
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.380]   Because when you don't know what to say,
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.020]   and you're talking to a girl who's emotional,
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.380]   just say that, it will help you.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.420]   Guys, that's free.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.040]   Gentlemen, that's free, okay?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.580]   That's gonna serve you well in the future.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.780]   Just look 'em in the eyes and go, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.220]   How did that make you feel?
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:13.020]   And she said, and she goes, not good.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.420]   And I was like, I needed a longer answer.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.820]   I'm still thinking, you know?
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.220]   And she says, not good, and I said, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.700]   I said, sometimes guys do that.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.540]   Sometimes people do that.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.580]   Sometimes they say things that they don't mean,
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.140]   and I said, you know what, and this is what I want you
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.900]   to learn from my six-year-old.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.820]   I just said, you're right in saying that he's a liar.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.340]   That's what he did, he lied to you.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.980]   When you say you're gonna do something and you don't do it,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.900]   that is a lie indeed.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.140]   And she said, well, Kelly did say that he had a crush on me.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.900]   And I said, I will crush him, Finley.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.420]   I said, what is a crush?
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.260]   What does that even mean?
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.780]   She goes, I don't know, I think it means that he likes me.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.340]   And I said, Finley, here's the deal.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.220]   We're not even gonna have that conversation
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.740]   for about 20 years, okay?
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.940]   But here's the deal.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.620]   When we do have it, I want you to learn something
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.180]   from this experience, all right?
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.340]   If a guy does not keep his commitment,
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.660]   then he's not someone that you're interested in.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.420]   If breaking commitments marks his life,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.980]   then that's something that you don't wanna
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.700]   go through life with.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.540]   And so don't look at how he treats you
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   because if he's trying to impress you,
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.620]   he may treat you well.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.820]   In this situation, he didn't.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.060]   But if he's trying to, right,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.740]   he's trying to impress you, he may treat you well.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.060]   Look at how he treats the commitments of others
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.620]   because one day, that emotional rush is gonna leave
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.940]   and that's how he's gonna treat you
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.780]   and that's how he's gonna treat marriage.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.340]   And the same thing goes for ladies.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.420]   I'm not just picking on the guys.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   Ladies, same thing for you.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.820]   If she's flighty and flaky and noncommittal
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.200]   and she's in and out and she's whimsical,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.380]   constantly trying to discern what the Lord's will is
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.260]   and chasing it like a tail,
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.260]   not that she has a tail, but that's weird,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.740]   be careful.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.820]   Be cautious.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:14.940]   It really matters to God.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.540]   I'm gonna share some verses with you
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.800]   just to make this point.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.500]   In Numbers 30, and so here's what's going on
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.140]   is the Israelites have been wandering
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.260]   through the desert for 40 years.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.640]   This would have been a verse that Jephthah knew
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.140]   and probably drove his actions.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.300]   And so in Numbers 30, the Israelites have been
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.780]   roaming the desert for 40 years
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.720]   and Moses thinks he's about to take them
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.080]   into the promised land, but he's not.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.420]   And so God says, what happens in 40 years
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.100]   is the generation turns.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.540]   And so those who knew the law of the Lord
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.920]   were no longer there and there's been this uprising,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.380]   this Gen Y, or these millennials, if you will,
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.340]   and they didn't know what was important to God.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.980]   And so God just says, hey, before they go
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.580]   in the promised land, you've gotta tell them
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.060]   what is most important to me.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.660]   And so he walks Moses through the laws
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.620]   of the Old Testament.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.260]   He walks Moses through the ceremonies that matter to God.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.980]   And then he says, hey, this is what is most important to me.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.740]   You must tell them this thing right here
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.700]   in his Numbers 30, verses one and two.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.420]   Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel,
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.180]   this is what the Lord commands.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.460]   When a man makes a vow to the Lord
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.260]   or takes an oath to obligate himself by pledge,
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.380]   he must not break his word, but must do everything
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.100]   that he said he was going to do.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.420]   This is what matters to God.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.300]   Before you go into the promised land,
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.900]   you need to know what matters most to God
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.640]   is that a man does what he says he's going to do.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.420]   That's my second point this evening
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.820]   is why we must keep commitments if we're Christians.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.300]   If you're not a Christian here in your flaky,
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.220]   we understand, but if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.660]   why we must keep commitments.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.500]   Because God who set the world into motion
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.120]   knows that nearly anything great that happens
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.460]   comes out of a commitment.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.920]   No one has a beautiful faith without a commitment.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.460]   No one knows the word of God well without a commitment.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.540]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.260]   There is no Super Bowl ring without an intense commitment.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.580]   There is no NBA championship without an intense commitment.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.500]   Everything that you think of great in the world,
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.620]   every CEO, every incredible artist,
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.700]   everybody who is incredibly skilled
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.700]   is something that comes through an intense commitment
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.580]   and likewise a relationship with God.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.480]   God made the world that way.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.340]   And he says commitment really matters.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.860]   Keeping your commitments really, really matter,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.660]   not just following your emotions.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.800]   And so Christians, friends, listen,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:59.340]   Christians should be the forerunners of great things.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.720]   Like we should be the most innovative, most creative,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.260]   most manufacturer of beautiful things in the world.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.380]   The best artists, the best engineers, the best scientists,
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.940]   the best teachers should be followers of Christ.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.820]   But we haven't preserved this idea
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.660]   in fact we're just as flaky as pagans.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.180]   And we say we're Christ followers,
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.020]   but we're not.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.420]   We're not committed to much except for the things
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.940]   that we really, really, really, really want.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.620]   And so I tell you this guys,
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.340]   because in this series what I wanna do
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.700]   is I wanna give you what's called a biblical worldview.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.260]   And that's a buzzword you're gonna hear
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.780]   if you hang out in church much,
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.260]   a biblical worldview, this is what's important.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.100]   And a biblical worldview just means
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.940]   it's the way that you see the world,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.140]   it's the lens of which you see the world through,
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.120]   that you would see it through God's word
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.060]   as he intended the world to be.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.780]   Not through your experience and not through the culture
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.140]   that has educated you,
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.740]   but that you would see it through a biblical worldview.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.520]   Let me just give you some examples to hit this home.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.900]   People will say, well I don't wanna be married.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.900]   I say, hey that's interesting.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.540]   That's good that you have identified your desires.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.640]   Do you know what God wants for you?
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.940]   Are you following your emotions and your feelings?
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.980]   Or have you searched the word of God and said,
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.460]   hey God, what do you want for me?
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.820]   People come and say, hey I don't wanna have children.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.620]   Just not really into it.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.940]   Okay, great, we've identified your preference.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.060]   Now do you know what God desires for you?
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.640]   Do you know how God views children?
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.740]   Do you view children like God does?
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.500]   Or has your preference and your desires
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.260]   and your feelings trumped everything else?
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.820]   Because that's what culture teaches.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.380]   I'll give you some others.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.280]   They'll say, well I believe divorce is an option.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.180]   Interesting.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.780]   Do you know what God believes?
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.020]   Do you know what God says about it?
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.740]   Do you get to determine what is real?
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.340]   Or does God determine what is real?
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.300]   And in what situation and what does his word teach?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.020]   They'll say things like,
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.820]   well I think I should take a job if it means more money.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.940]   Okay, that is definitely the logic of our culture.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.780]   What does God think?
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.020]   Go back and listen to last week.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.400]   What does God desire for you?
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.740]   I want you to have a biblical worldview.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.100]   Our opinions are shaped most by culture and experience.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.100]   But listen to what God's word says.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.980]   And let me tell you what it says specifically
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.860]   in regards to this topic, Ecclesiastes chapter five,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.240]   verses five and six.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.800]   It is better to not vow than to make a vow
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.920]   and not fulfill it.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.500]   It is better to not or not to vow
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.160]   than to make a vow and not fulfill it.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.740]   Do not let your mouth lead you into sin.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.980]   To make a commitment and not to fulfill
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.760]   that commitment is sin, he says.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.340]   This is a biblical worldview.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.180]   This redefines some things for you.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.460]   This is what the scripture says.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.020]   And I want you to tell you why,
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.060]   I wanna tell you why that verse is so familiar to me.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.700]   Anybody know why it's so familiar to me?
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.240]   If you do, you don't have a microphone.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.440]   So let me just tell you.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.840]   I say it at every single wedding I do.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.380]   I say it very often.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.620]   I look at the couple and in front of all
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.380]   of their friends and family.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.220]   I just say, hey, do you know that the scripture says
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.980]   to not be hasty in regards to these sorts of things?
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.980]   He says it's better not to make a vow.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.440]   In a minute, you're gonna say these things we call vows.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.540]   He just says it's better not to make one
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.100]   than to make one and not fulfill it.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.260]   So this would be a great out.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.980]   And when Monica and I are meeting with a couple,
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.100]   I just say, hey, is there any reason that you would end this
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.260]   and to which they always say,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.740]   I mean, we've done this dozens of times.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.420]   They always say, no, never, I love him, he's great.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.020]   And then I'm usually the jerk that just says, okay, cool.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.420]   Hey, if he cheated on you with your best friend,
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.460]   we still good?
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.700]   You still in?
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   Well, he would never do that.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.500]   I know he wouldn't, but if he did.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.300]   [congregation laughing]
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.500]   And to him, I just look at him,
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.340]   if she cheated on you with your brother,
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.580]   I know that's an awful thought,
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.900]   but I want you to go there for a minute.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.980]   You might get sick to your stomach,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.140]   but I want you to go there because I wanna know
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.020]   what you would choose.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.580]   If she cheated on you with your brother, are you still in?
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.940]   Because if not, let's just write that in the vows,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.460]   richer or poorer, till death do us part,
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.060]   in sickness and in health,
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.820]   unless he cheats on me with my brother.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.300]   You know, we'll just make that a part of it
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.100]   'cause we're about to say some crazy things
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.840]   as God is your witness.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.060]   And so let's just say what we mean.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.900]   Let's just say what we believe to be true
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.040]   in front of everyone, because as we steward the gospel,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.460]   let me ask you something.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.540]   Who is going to believe you when you say
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.260]   a man lived and he died and he came back to life,
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.340]   when you can't even keep a movie date, you know?
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.260]   It's like, no, I'm not, what are you talking about?
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.100]   You lie all the time.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.820]   Why would I believe you about Jesus?
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.240]   You see why it matters?
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:04.020]   You hinder the gospel when you're flaky
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.360]   and flighty and flippant and noncommittal.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.540]   And so it really matters to God.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.900]   I'll say this real quickly.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.080]   We keep commitments when we want to.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.840]   And I just have a front row seat of this.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.120]   And I see it all the time in specifically
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.280]   what I shared with you up front,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.120]   like in regards to engagement rings.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.120]   Like, you know, I meet dudes that are like broke,
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.300]   like no money, and they've never had a plan
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.340]   for proposals or anything like that.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.060]   But they meet her, and they're like,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.200]   all right, I gotta get an engagement ring.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.600]   And so they do what I did.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.140]   They go online and they begin to learn DEF,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.180]   color, cut, clarity, caret, you know,
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.780]   and VS1, SI1, they become experts on diamonds.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.220]   And then at some point, they begin to look
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.420]   and see how much they are.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.220]   And they begin to hyperventilate.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.540]   And they're like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, okay,
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.500]   how am I gonna do this?
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.660]   'Cause I've never saved a dime in my life.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.420]   But all of a sudden, like in two weeks,
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.620]   they have thousands of dollars.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.560]   Like they sold all of their things,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.140]   they pawned their stuff, they sold plasma.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.060]   And they're like, I'm ready.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.980]   Like, I'm ready to make this commitment, okay?
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.260]   Like somehow, like magically.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.380]   Because when we really, really want something,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.540]   we become motivated and we do it,
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.860]   but we're led by selfishness.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.540]   And I just wanna tell you, that doesn't go well.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.620]   Those are really emotional decisions
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.500]   that lack plans and commitments.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.020]   And it doesn't go well, because that same passion
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.340]   that led you into that decision
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.000]   is gonna be the same passion that leads 52% of people
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.120]   out of that decision.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.140]   And there's this other big percentage of people
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   that remain in that decision miserably,
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.780]   but they just don't respect it.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.700]   They don't respect the covenant they made.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.820]   And I don't want that for you.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.800]   And so if you wonder why I say crazy things
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.540]   and maybe hurt your feelings, it's because I love you.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.300]   I care about you, and I don't want that for you.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.100]   I want something better for you.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.340]   I want something more amazing for you.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.080]   And so you're like, okay, well, so far, JP,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.900]   you've given us some obscure Old Testament passages.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.100]   You've told us about Jephthah.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.660]   You've told us about Moses.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.300]   Is this really something important to Jesus?
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.740]   And in Matthew chapter five,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.240]   Jesus has one shot at the greatest sermon ever given.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.300]   It's the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.380]   And so he's gonna cover what's most important
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.420]   to the kingdom of God.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.140]   And he says this in verse 33.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.740]   "Again, you have heard that it was said
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.220]   "to the people long ago, do not break your oath,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.080]   "but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord."
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.740]   By the way, that's Moses who said that.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.880]   He's referencing Numbers chapter 30 right here.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.660]   And he goes on to say that when you make an oath,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.960]   if you're a follower of mine, just say yes and just say no.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.500]   You don't need to say, I promise, I really, literally,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.300]   I absolutely, I guarantee you, I will.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.020]   Just say yes, I will do it.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.560]   And if you're a follower of mine,
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.840]   people know that yes is as good, as gold, as solid, as oak.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.340]   It's unbreakable, unshakable, permanent,
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.480]   because you're mine.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.860]   So just look them in the eyes and say yes, I'll be there.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.260]   Or no, I can't.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.920]   But when you say yes, you keep that oath,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.060]   even when it hurts.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.200]   If you make a decision, honor it.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.040]   My third and final point.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.400]   What commitment should mark us?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.360]   I'm gonna give you four things quickly.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.580]   What commitments should mark us?
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.900]   The first one and most important one
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.820]   is a commitment to follow Christ.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:42.720]   Like you only know this diluted, Americanized Christianity
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.900]   that I don't think is biblical Christianity,
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.100]   speaking of biblical worldview.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.580]   But it's all you know.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.060]   And so don't compare yourself to that.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.560]   Like 'cause all the time I talk to people,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.840]   they're like, oh yeah, I believe in God.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.800]   I just don't take my faith too serious.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.040]   I'm like, well Jesus took it serious.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   And God takes your faith serious.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.720]   And so let me just propose a question to you.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.000]   What if, like I think so many of us
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.480]   are like lukewarm Christians.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.220]   And so let me just ask this question.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.920]   What if there's no such thing as a lukewarm Christian?
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.400]   Like what if that's not a Christian at all?
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.520]   You might be like, whoa, JP, you're questioning my salvation.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.960]   No, I'm trying to get you to question your salvation.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.620]   Not because I want to drive you towards some anxious place.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.840]   But as you examine your life,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.600]   I'm not talking about your words and something you said.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.540]   I'm saying do you believe in Jesus?
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.360]   Do you believe that he died for your sins?
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.980]   Do you believe that he raised from the dead?
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.480]   Does that what you believe?
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.800]   And are people that you work with,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.360]   they're like, I don't know if she's a Christian.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.720]   I mean, I have no idea.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.040]   Or are they like, absolutely, she's a Christ follower.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.640]   She's following Jesus.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.800]   In the way that she dates, she's following Jesus.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.840]   In the things that she says, she's following Jesus.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   In the places she goes, she's following Jesus.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   In the way she spends her money, she's following Jesus.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.520]   She is a Jesus follower.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.560]   That is a committed follower of Christ right there.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.320]   Like I don't know, maybe he's Muslim, maybe he's Buddhist.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.000]   I don't know, maybe he's spiritual, but not religious.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.200]   I don't know what he is.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.760]   Are you all in?
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.440]   Committed to following Christ.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.780]   Second thing, committed to God's people.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.080]   Committed to God's people.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.240]   The second thing we're committed to,
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   this is a commitment that should mark us.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.480]   Specifically, church, by the way of membership,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.300]   that there's a church.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.520]   I don't mean a church that you attend,
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.360]   but there's a church that you belong to,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.060]   that the elders are in authority over you,
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.560]   that you go there, you're a contributor,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.760]   that you're a part of this church.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.000]   Can I tell you something, friends,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.600]   and I want you to lean in, I want you to write it down,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.920]   I want you to listen closely.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.360]   Church was never meant to be a place you go to.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.620]   Church is your identity.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.960]   You're the body of Christ.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.100]   It's who you are.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.380]   There is nowhere in the Bible that it talks of church
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.840]   as a place that you go to.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.680]   Church is the body, the hands and feet,
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.800]   the literal hands and feet of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.160]   And so that you would be there, be accounted for,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.000]   be a member there, that you would belong there.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.780]   And so what's great about this
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.800]   is if you're a member of a church,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.680]   I know half of you go to another church,
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.080]   I love that you're here, we exist to serve the city.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.300]   But if you don't have a church home,
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.460]   this Sunday you can show up here,
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.000]   and we would love to talk to you
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.020]   about our membership class,
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.420]   which just happens to be this Sunday.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.020]   I didn't even realize that when I wrote this message.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.680]   It's this Sunday.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.360]   You can go there and you can hear
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.900]   what it is like to belong to a church.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.920]   And friends, can I just tell you,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.480]   there's two kinds of people in the room.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.280]   If you're a follower of Christ, if you're a Christian,
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.860]   I'm talking to Christians, if you're a Christian,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.900]   you either belong to a church or you don't.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.440]   If you don't, I'm asking you to change that this Sunday.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.960]   It'll be the best Valentine's gift
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.640]   you could give yourself this Sunday.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.320]   And the second thing is community.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.520]   And so if you belong to a church of 1,000 plus people,
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.760]   that's not really your community, okay?
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.160]   That's where you worship corporately,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.140]   it's where you sing, it's where you're fed
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.480]   from the scriptures.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.340]   But beyond your preferences,
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.920]   there should be these group of people
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.160]   who come alongside you and celebrate the hurts of life,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.040]   and I'm sorry, not celebrate the hurts of life,
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   carry the burdens of life with you
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.280]   and celebrate the victories of life with you.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.800]   They're folks that help you make rent when you can't.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.480]   They're folks that visit you in the hospital,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.840]   they're your pastors, and said otherwise,
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.720]   they're the people you visit in the hospital,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.360]   they're the people whose rent you help pay.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.820]   It's a group that you belong to,
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.360]   we call that community here.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.120]   That should be a part of your life
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.800]   if you're a Christ follower.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.520]   You should be committed to that.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.000]   You should show up when you don't feel like it.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.960]   Because it's important, Hebrews 10, 25 says,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.720]   "Let us not forsake the gathering together
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.960]   "as some are in the habit of doing.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.260]   "But all the more, let's continue to spur one another on,
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.000]   "encourage one another towards love and good deeds."
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   Commitment to serve.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.520]   Let's serve in the church.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.500]   That's you using your gifts in the way
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.360]   and for the reason they were given to you.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.420]   That's serving others, that's giving your life away.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:09.040]   And lastly, any commitments we've made.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.120]   These are commitments we should keep,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.320]   commitments that mark us, commitments we've made.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.160]   And so let me just wrap up with this
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.580]   and just say maybe, right, maybe you're like,
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.300]   but JP, certainly, like what if grandma comes to town
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.860]   and I just didn't know she was coming to town
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.180]   because I didn't get her email and she doesn't send emails
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.700]   and then I had made a commitment to go see a movie
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.820]   but now grandma's in town and I need to see my grandma.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.860]   Let me, I'm gonna give you something
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.680]   that's gonna be a gift to you.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.300]   Write it down, I want you to remember this.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.740]   If all 4,000 folks that are tuned in right now
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.800]   would just do this one thing,
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.180]   it would make the world a better place.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.220]   And so it's super practical,
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.420]   it's no more practical than this, you ready?
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.560]   Okay, when you give someone a commitment,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   you've given them a gift.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.940]   You've given them a gift of your time,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.340]   you've gone on your calendar and you said,
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.860]   hey, this chunk of time in the future, that belongs to you
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.020]   or at least I'm going to share that with you.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.500]   I'm gonna help you move Friday at seven.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.380]   I'm giving you the gift of my time in this commitment.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.460]   And then lo and behold, grandma says, guess what,
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.980]   surprise, I'm coming in on Friday, can't wait to see you.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.460]   I've got big plans, please clear your calendar.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.540]   Oh no, I'm committed, what do I do?
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.020]   Here's what you don't do, you don't say,
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.460]   hey, I said that, I'm sorry, my grandma's coming into town.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.380]   You don't do that.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.300]   You go to them and as you would with any gift
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.600]   that you give somebody, you say, hey,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.520]   I made a commitment to you
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.660]   that I would be there Friday at seven.
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.780]   I want to ask if I can have that commitment back.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.700]   I gave you the gift of my time,
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.220]   would you please consider giving that gift back
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.940]   and you be very specific, not vague, not ambiguous.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.020]   You say, my grandmother's coming to town.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.500]   You say, hey, there's something that has come up
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.980]   that I view as more important than that time that I gave you
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.740]   and this is what that something is, that's loving,
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.380]   that's so caring.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.780]   You're not what they're saying about you
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.340]   is flaky and vague and ambiguous and managing information,
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.200]   that's not loving, that's sinful.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.980]   I gave you the gift of my time, may I have that gift back?
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.760]   I promise you, probably shouldn't,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.500]   most of the time, most of the time,
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.580]   they're gonna say, absolutely.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.060]   Thank you for the way that you just did that.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.420]   You just modeled something for me.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.060]   You just made your God more attractive.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.060]   I mean, you're a Jesus follower
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.600]   and you just made following Jesus more attractive to me
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.860]   in the way that you did that, in the way that you asked me,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.380]   the way that you were so clear and mature
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.660]   and adulting about it.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.260]   And so I just encourage you, I admonish you even,
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.980]   don't be afraid of difficult commitments.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.280]   Adulting means making and keeping them.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.580]   Adulting means making difficult commitments
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.380]   and keeping them and so, in summary,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.180]   we don't keep commitments because of those reasons,
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.240]   because we're over committed,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.020]   because we're afraid that better options
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.480]   are going to come along and pick this up.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.900]   And we must keep our commitments
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.300]   because it's so clear in God's word that it matters to him
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.620]   and the commitments that mark us
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.460]   are a commitment to follow Christ,
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.620]   a commitment to God's people,
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.900]   a commitment to serve and commitments that we've made.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.800]   And so I told Finley, I said, hey,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.220]   the good news is about this whole situation
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.860]   when she's so upset that Kyle didn't keep his word
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.460]   and he played gaga ball, I just said,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.980]   the good news is that's just inconsistent
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.480]   with who Christ followers are.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.700]   And she said, how do you know?
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.460]   And I said, because Finley, Christ followers follow Jesus
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.500]   and don't you understand that Jesus, Finley,
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.120]   Jesus kept his commitment even when it hurt.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.100]   Even when it hurt, he's there in the garden of Gethsemane,
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.900]   he's like, God, let this cup pass from me,
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.140]   but not my will, thy will.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.820]   God, I'm committed to these people, Jesus, friends,
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.700]   Jesus is committed to you
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.860]   more than you've ever been committed to anything.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.060]   He's committed to you so much so
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.620]   that he took all of your sins on himself.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.420]   Out of an act of love for you,
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.220]   you tortured, suffered publicly, humiliated,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.500]   asphyxiated, nailed to two pieces of wood publicly
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.780]   for you, specifically you.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.460]   He kept his commitment, even when it hurt.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.540]   I read the story of Jephthah, I'm like, what?
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.580]   He sacrificed his daughter?
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.260]   Like that man's crazy.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.820]   Why would he do that?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.700]   Who would do that?
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.740]   Who would sacrifice their only child?
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.140]   That's crazy, why would he do that?
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.180]   God did it.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.480]   God did it.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:02.420]   God sacrificed his only child, his only son.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.220]   He's committed to you to show you how committed to you.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.060]   He loves you more than a child.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:17.900]   He's pursuing you, radically chasing you into the world.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.700]   He knows what you're going through.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.540]   You think we don't understand what you're going through?
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.320]   It's crazy out there, man.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.820]   Everybody fighting for your attention.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.380]   Feel like you gotta be a bigger, better you.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.420]   You're stuck in these ruts trying to build your empire
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.540]   and God says, man, 100 years from now,
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.640]   it's not gonna matter.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.180]   You wanna know who climbs up the hill
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.780]   to be in my holy place and dwell
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.540]   in the tent of the Lord forever?
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.740]   Jesus did.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:54.180]   Jesus did, he did it for you, in spite of you,
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.940]   on behalf of you, so that you might be with him
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.980]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.420]   That's the gospel, that's the good news, man.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.740]   That is the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.940]   That's what I want you to give your lives to.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.780]   And so as you follow that man, you're committed.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.300]   You keep your commitments, you represent him well.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.140]   Let me pray.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:23.660]   Father, we thank you for Jephthah
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.460]   and we don't understand how he made it to the hall of faith
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.100]   in Hebrews chapter 11, but we trust that he did some things
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.420]   that you found worthy.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:41.620]   Father, we just confess to you, we've done nothing
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.600]   that would make us worthy of you.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.300]   But Lord, we trust that you have in your commitment to us
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.780]   and your love for us through the death and the resurrection
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.540]   of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.840]   God, we plead the cross and the cross alone,
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.260]   the blood of Jesus alone.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.300]   We trust in Jesus and Jesus alone.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.260]   And we're so grateful for that unbelievable, undeniable,
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.460]   radical, crazy commitment to us that you would sacrifice
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.260]   your only child on our behalf to purchase us to yourself,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.660]   to be with you forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.740]   and help the worries of our world fade against that reality,
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.460]   help the troubles of tomorrow fade against that reality,
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.960]   help the problems in our life fade against that reality
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.840]   and the sins of our flesh fade against that reality.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.680]   Please, God.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.160]   Thank you for your commitment to us.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.760]   We trust in you and you alone.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
