[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.640]   Let's go, come on.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080]   New series at the porch, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.040]   Friends at Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, of course, Canada,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840]   the different 15 Ports Live locations.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.360]   We are kicking off a new series called Before There Were Kings,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.640]   where we, for the next handful of weeks,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.560]   are going to look at a number of stories inside of the book of Judges.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.960]   If you are anything like me, this will be your very first series on the book of Judges.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.520]   But there's some incredible teaching and truths that are in there.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.760]   Hey, let me start tonight by addressing this.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.720]   One of the things that if you have children someday,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.960]   maybe you have children or you're listening to this and you have children,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.160]   you're going to have to navigate is all around
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.720]   how do you handle the whole issue of Santa Claus?
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.520]   And are you going to be the parents that are like,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.680]   hey, we're doing Santa Claus?
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.160]   Are you going to be the parents that don't do Santa Claus?
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.880]   There's really hot sports opinions as it relates to what you should do.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.520]   And so likely, whether you decide to or not,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.920]   you're going to have somebody that's a sibling or someone in your community group
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.440]   or someone in your life who's going to have a very strong opinion in the opposite direction,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.080]   which always makes for interesting family get-togethers where they're like,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.200]   yeah, we love our children, so we don't do Santa.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.360]   And you're like, awesome, OK.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.400]   And either way, you're going to have to kind of navigate through that if it's part.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   If you stop and think about it, and this isn't a knock on Santa, we do Santa.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.880]   It's kind of a funny deal that all these different people in society and culture
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.160]   and parents in general are kind of like playing this whole game
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.840]   or promoting this lie that everyone knows is not true with kids.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.600]   Where we're like, yes, Santa, it's awesome he's out there.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.320]   But no, he's not, and this is not real.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   And yet everywhere you look at society, it's just kind of a part of the culture,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.440]   and it's something that we promote.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.920]   And again, my point is not to knock on Santa.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800]   It's just like we kind of all play this game.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.160]   And if I'm bursting your bubble right now and Santa, not knowing that Santa's not real,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.360]   this may not be the place for you.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.680]   And either way, it's just this phenomenon that when you stop and think about it,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.600]   it's just kind of a funny deal that we all get into.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.480]   And we pull this prank on everyone fifth grade and under.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.680]   And the reason I start there is just 'cause like in that same way
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.440]   that they're promoting this thing that we kind of all know is not true.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.240]   Maybe we wish it was true, and there was some guy that lived in the North Pole
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.760]   and was making presents all year long.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   We really all know that's not the case.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.840]   There's other things in culture where we similarly promote and suggest
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   and even throw out there and try to get people to believe that,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   hey, this is a truth or you should embrace this idea.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.640]   One of them that I wanna talk about tonight is something
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.800]   that you may not have ever thought about before, but it's just this.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.720]   It's this idea that's being promoted that is similarly not true,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   which is, hey, follow your heart.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.440]   The key to success in life, the key for you to be all that you're intended to be
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880]   is for you to be someone who follows your heart, follow your desires.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.120]   It's something that we tell children,
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.680]   it's something you've probably heard a ton of.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.320]   It's something that if you watch any amount of entertainment,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   Hollywood TV celebrities, you're gonna hear this idea of,
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.320]   hey, follow your heart.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.800]   You may hear different variations of it.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.400]   Always be true to your heart.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.680]   Follow all the things that you're intended to be.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.960]   Don't let anyone tell you who you should become.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.920]   Just follow your heart.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.040]   And it's kind of an interesting phrase 'cause you go like,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.520]   well, what does that actually mean?
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.120]   Like, follow my desires, follow kind of the things and feelings
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   that I have, the emotions that I have.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.200]   And the reason I say that it breaks down
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.640]   and we kinda, if you stop and think about it, you go,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.040]   man, I don't know if that is actually true
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.120]   and it's certainly not applicable universally.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   It's certainly not something where we've been like,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.440]   you know what, ISIS, at the end of the day,
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.520]   you guys just need to follow your heart.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.480]   That would be really the remedy we should all embrace.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.640]   It's something that in the real world,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   it just doesn't really work.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.240]   You will never hear a parole officer sitting down
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.740]   with someone who needs parole being like,
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.120]   look, you wanna get out of here?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.400]   There's one way to, follow your heart.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.720]   Whatever you desire, do that.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.000]   You'll never hear a teacher sitting down
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   with a bunch of junior high kids being like,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.320]   look guys, the key to success in life,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   do whatever you feel like whenever you feel like doing it
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   and you will succeed.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.720]   Or a marriage counselor sitting down and saying,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   you guys wanna make this work?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.420]   You need to do whatever you feel like
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.120]   whenever you feel like it, every time.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.760]   That's the key to success.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.540]   Follow your desires.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.440]   Follow whatever your heart is telling you.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.120]   I mean, it's insanity.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.400]   And when you stop to think about it, you're like,
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.240]   man, that really is not a helpful thing.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   And we kinda just mean by it, we just mean like,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.200]   I believe in ya, if you wanna be a doctor, you can.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   We don't really mean like, follow the desires
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.360]   or follow your heart wherever it leads you.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.380]   And yet, if you embrace this idea,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.600]   it's not just something silly
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.120]   whenever you stop to think about it.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.400]   It has potentially or usually, if it's taken and embraced
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.800]   and applied in someone's life,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.520]   extremely dangerous consequences.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.400]   Dangerous consequences for your relationships,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.200]   for your own personal kinda well-being,
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.000]   your spiritual health, every arena of your life.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.920]   If you were to apply this idea of,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.520]   hey, I'm just gonna follow the desires that I have,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.760]   it is going to lead you off a cliff.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.880]   And tonight, we're gonna look at a book,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.520]   that the Book of Judges,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.760]   and we're gonna look at the final story
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.080]   in the Book of Judges, which is really meant
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.680]   to communicate that very idea.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.140]   That the Book of Judges was a book that was preserved
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.640]   in the history of Israel,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.980]   and it's a bunch of these true stories that took place,
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.440]   and it was preserved to be a warning shot to the nation.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.960]   If you follow your heart, it is going to kill you,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.080]   hurt people around you, and hurt the nation overall.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.620]   And God said, I want to preserve this book
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.660]   that takes place in a time where there were no kings,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.160]   and so everyone had the ability to do whatever
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.880]   their heart led them to do, or to follow God's law.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.560]   And God said, hey, there's a group of people in the nation,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.680]   and really, just one story after the next,
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.980]   it's just tragic, where people decided,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.140]   hey, I'm gonna follow my heart.
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.560]   And it led to tremendous consequences for the nation,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.480]   for their families, for people inside of it.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800]   So we're gonna look at these different stories
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.760]   that contain some truths applicable to us,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.160]   but the whole book could be summarized
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.360]   in the last sentence of the book, where it says this.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.480]   In those days, Judges 21, verse 25,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   Israel had no king, and everyone did as they saw fit,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.200]   or your translation may say, as was right in their own eyes,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.440]   or as seemed right to them.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.360]   Everyone, this was the you do you of the Bible.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.880]   In those days, everyone did what they thought
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.320]   was applicable and what was right for them,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.560]   and story after story, and God says,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.320]   I want you to write it down, because I want people to know
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.520]   that when they begin to just say,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.680]   I'm just gonna follow my heart wherever it leads,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.640]   it is catastrophic consequences for them,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.980]   for everyone around them, and for, in this case,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.820]   the nation as a whole.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.960]   So tonight, here's what we're gonna do.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.400]   I'm gonna tell you the last story of the book.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.620]   And so we're gonna watch a movie for about 15 minutes.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.760]   I'm just gonna tell exactly kind of what happens,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.340]   because this is the craziest story in the Bible.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.320]   Other than the crucifixion of Jesus,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.720]   it's definitely the most horrific
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.200]   and brutal story in the Bible.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.240]   So you're about to hear a story that is not prescriptive
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.960]   about like, hey, go out and do these things.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.880]   You're about to hear a story that is like,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.360]   wow, that escalated really quickly,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.120]   and a story that was preserved to be a warning
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.560]   to you, to me, and to the nation of Israel,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   to anyone who read it.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.520]   So the book of Judges is, just to give you
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.160]   a little context of what's going on,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.040]   Moses back up, the Old Testament,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.840]   is all about the nation of Israel.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.120]   And at some point, Moses leads the people of Israel
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.160]   out of the land of, anybody know?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   Egypt, that's right, here we go.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.040]   He leads them out of Egypt, Charlton Heston,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.480]   let my people go, got the tablets, we're outta here.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.220]   He goes outta there, God says, Moses,
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.560]   you're not taking 'em in, Mo.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.160]   Joshua's gonna lead 'em into the promised land.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.400]   Joshua takes 'em into the promised land,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.940]   they get to the promised land, they all set up shop,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.000]   we're on these different lands, different places.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.960]   Then begins the book of Judges.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   Joshua dies, and things get a little crazy.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   Seven cycles of the same thing happen
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.320]   over and over and over again.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.600]   And each one gets worse and worse.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.480]   Here's the cycle that happens.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.240]   There's sin, and the nation of Israel
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.160]   would sin against God, they're like,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.480]   God, you know what, we reject you.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.880]   God says, great, you reject me?
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.160]   Other people are gonna come in,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.360]   and they're gonna make you slaves.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.720]   They would be made slaves, supplication is just a word
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.680]   that means cry out to God.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.400]   So basically, they're like, we sin,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   and then they're made slaves.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.680]   They're like, we're sorry.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.240]   And God would send a judge, or a savior,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.920]   to come in and to set the people free.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.720]   A judge was not someone with a gavel and a robe.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.400]   He was essentially a military leader
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.320]   who would set the nation free.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   So this happens seven different times,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.120]   and it tells us every single time
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.600]   it gets worse and worse and worse,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.320]   until the story we're about to read picks up tonight.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   And this comes from Judges chapter 19,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.360]   verses one, really, Judges 19 through 21.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.660]   So I'm gonna just summarize, I'm gonna tell the story,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.080]   because this story is crazy.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.360]   Here we go, verse one.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   In those days, Israel had no king.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   So it's setting up again.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.320]   It emphasizes this throughout the book.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.640]   Before there were kings.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.840]   Now a Levite who lived in the remote area
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.040]   in a hill country of Ephraim took a concubine
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.160]   from Bethlehem in Judah.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.880]   So basically, it starts off with a Levite,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.160]   it's just a priest, and it says that there was this priest
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.360]   who decided, you know what, I'm gonna take a girl,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.480]   and I'm not gonna make her my wife,
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   she's gonna be like a living girlfriend,
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.640]   which is a concubine.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.960]   And so we're gonna have sex together,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.320]   and it's gonna be great.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   Here we go, not prescriptive, again, descriptive,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.320]   or in other words, it's not telling you to do this,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.000]   it's saying this is what happened
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.640]   as people drifted further and further from God.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.040]   But she, that's a concubine, a concubine is just,
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.320]   again, it's like a living girlfriend,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.360]   it's someone who's not a wife,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.720]   doesn't have the privileges of a wife.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.040]   And she was unfaithful to him, shocker.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.020]   She left him and went back to her parents' home
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.120]   in Bethlehem, in Judah.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.920]   She goes back, and after she had been there for four months,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.680]   her husband was like, hey, where's that girl?
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.320]   So initially, she cheats on him,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.200]   he's like, great, we're done, thank you, next.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.520]   Four months go by, and he decides, where's that girl at?
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.400]   And so he goes back to her parents' home,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   here's what happens.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.320]   He went to her parents' home
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.880]   to try to persuade her to return.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.680]   He had with him his servant and two donkeys,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.080]   just in case you're wondering.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.600]   She took her parents, or she took him, when he gets there,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.520]   into her parents' home, and when her father saw him,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.940]   he was gladly welcomed.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.360]   His father-in-law, the woman's father,
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.520]   prevailed on him to stay,
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.440]   so he remained for him for three days,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.960]   eating and drinking and sleeping there.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.840]   So basically, what happens next,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.800]   he's hanging out three days,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   they're eating and drinking,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.460]   the father-in-law's like, great,
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.800]   you're the son-in-law I never had,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.200]   and they're hanging out together,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.760]   and then after three days, the guy's like,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.080]   man, I keep waking up, we're partying,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.160]   I wake up the next day hungover, I need to get out of here,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.960]   I need to bring her, we're going back home.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.400]   And the guy says, hey, won't you stay another day?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.480]   He says, no, I don't wanna do that.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   Well, just, you know, let's have another meal
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200]   and hang out a little bit longer,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.220]   and you can eat and drink,
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.980]   and again, the same happens for a couple more days.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.680]   Finally, the guy is like, hey, I gotta get out of here.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.400]   So he takes her, begins to journey back home,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.420]   and he left so late in the day, we're told,
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.800]   that he has to stop halfway.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.080]   Be like, hey, we're going to Austin,
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.800]   but it's in the, or we, basically,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.520]   get too dark, we stop in Waco.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.360]   You with me?
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   They stop in a town called Gibeah.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.760]   He stops in Gibeah, and he doesn't know anyone there,
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.200]   and he meets this guy, and the guy's like,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.320]   hey, there's a law of hospitality,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.480]   big deal at this time, which basically was like,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.080]   hey, there's somebody sojourning or traveling through,
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.520]   you're welcoming them to your home.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.140]   So the guy's like, hey, you can stay with me.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.900]   They go into the home, and they're hanging out,
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.740]   and they're eating food.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.460]   It's him, the concubine, the two donkeys,
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.380]   the servant, and this guy.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.240]   Everybody with me?
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.340]   Any questions so far?
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.180]   Here we go.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.300]   So they're hanging out, they're eating the food.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.180]   All of a sudden, this is where things get weird.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.300]   There's this banging at the door
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.260]   of some people that are from the town that are like,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.460]   hey, we saw, they basically bang,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.140]   they're like, hey, Carl, we know you're in there,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.260]   and we know that you have a new friend in town,
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.520]   and we want to meet him.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.980]   The reason I say it gets weird is because this is where
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.320]   they say, and we want to have sex with him.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.200]   So there's this group, yes, there's this group,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.460]   not exactly your average day in Mayberry.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.300]   So there's this group gathering around the outside,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.500]   and they're like, hey, we got this stranger in town,
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.700]   let's have sex with him.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.220]   And the point of the story, the authors including it
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.820]   to make sure you know, hey, this is what happens
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.180]   when you drift away from God.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.460]   All kinds of just perversion begins to take place
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.960]   in your life, and things just kind of go off the rails.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.180]   So they're banging on the door, and they're like,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.140]   hey, we want to have sex with him.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.660]   And the guy says, hey, no, don't do this crazy, wicked deed.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.220]   And they won't stop banging on the door.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.980]   Finally, the Levite, the guy is like,
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.860]   hey, take my concubine, I'm not even sure that I wanted
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.820]   to take her from her dad's house anyway,
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.260]   and he throws her outside.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.100]   It's tragic.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.980]   And what happens next is that all night long,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.420]   she is abused, and abused, and abused by this group of men,
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.100]   and eventually, she ends up dead,
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.020]   to the point where she was sexually abused in such a way
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.100]   that it was so horrific that she's dead on the door.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.940]   So the Levite wakes up the next day,
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.660]   he walks outside of the house,
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.820]   and there is his concubine, dead on the doorstep.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.780]   And all of a sudden, he's going,
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.120]   who are these people, what happened here?
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.180]   It wasn't as though he had done the right thing in general
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.380]   to send her out there doing that, but he was afraid,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.820]   and he just did what he thought was the right thing
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.340]   in the moment, terrible as that was.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.780]   And he takes her, and he takes his body,
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.860]   and he puts her on his donkey,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.820]   and he begins the journey back home.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.900]   And he's thinking to himself,
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.780]   I can't believe how evil this group of people were
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.660]   in this area called Benjamin, which is one of the 12 tribes.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.940]   I'm telling you that for a reason,
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.660]   'cause at this time, there was 12 tribes,
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.620]   one of them was named Benjamin.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.780]   And he begins to go, I can't believe how evil
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.500]   these Benjamin people were, this is terrible.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.900]   I need to send a message out to the other 11 tribes.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.020]   You guys follow me?
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.300]   And he's like, I'm gonna write a note
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.180]   and let them know how wicked these Benjamin people are,
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.300]   this is unreal.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.060]   But then he realizes, no one's gonna do anything
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.900]   if I write a note to 'em.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.980]   If I just send a message, and he's like,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.340]   hey, there's some really bad people over there,
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.180]   they're not gonna do anything.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.140]   So then he has an idea, and he begins to think,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.820]   you know what I should do?
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.060]   I'm gonna cut up her body into 12 pieces,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.940]   and I'm gonna send it to all 12 areas throughout the nation
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.140]   with the message of this is what's going on,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.500]   there is evil in the land of Benjamin to these people.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.180]   That'll get people's attention.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.380]   Not the right thing to do, it's just what he decided to do.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.300]   So he sends out, and it says literally,
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.780]   they cut 'em limb by limb, and he cut 'em
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.680]   and sent 'em out all over the area.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.420]   And it got people's attention.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.580]   Here's what it says in verse 30 of chapter 19.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.380]   Everyone who saw this was saying,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.360]   so as the limbs, you know, they're sending out arms
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.420]   and legs and all these things.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.660]   Everyone who saw it said,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.180]   such a thing has never been done or seen,
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.700]   not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.060]   Just imagine, we must do something, so speak up.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.460]   So in the nation, all of a sudden,
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.700]   there's kinda outrage going on,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.020]   and people are going, did you hear what happened?
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.840]   Did you hear what happened?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.180]   And Benjamin, did you hear what happened?
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.740]   So the 11 other tribes, they get together,
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.360]   and they're like, we're not standing for this.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.340]   We're told they get 400,000 soldiers,
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.420]   and they go outside of the area of Benjamin,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.100]   and they say, give us the guys who did this to this woman.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.060]   Give us the guys who killed this woman.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.500]   And Benjamin says, nah, we're not doing that.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.340]   We will judge them on our own laws.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.140]   They're Benjamites, we're not doing it.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.860]   So the nation goes to war.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.140]   It's about to get even crazier.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.620]   So the nation has a civil war, the very first civil war,
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.260]   and it's 11 versus one.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.420]   And you would think, that's gonna last about five minutes,
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.380]   but Benjamin actually starts winning.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.660]   And the first day, they start winning,
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.060]   and they kill a bunch of the Israelites,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.940]   and the Israelites are, what, it's 11 to one, guys?
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.140]   How is this even happening?
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.860]   The next day that comes, same thing happens.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.340]   Finally, on the third day, the 11 tribes,
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.020]   I mean, by this point, they are angry.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.100]   They're seeing people die.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.180]   They're seeing their people, their fellow soldiers
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.740]   get killed for this wickedness in there,
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.500]   and they break through the Benjamites,
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.700]   and they begin, or the Benjamites,
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.300]   they break through, and they just begin
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.820]   slaughtering all of the soldiers of Benjamin.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.380]   And we're told that out of the 28,000 they had,
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.740]   only 600 survived, and they run off into the wilderness.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.060]   And then, they're still so upset,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.260]   they turn, and they go back to the nation,
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.980]   all the 11 tribes, they go to the area of Benjamin,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.420]   and they kill everybody, every man, every woman,
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.500]   and every child, because they thought,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.580]   this is such an evil group of people,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.580]   they can't be allowed to live.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.700]   They kill everyone.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.380]   They burn every town that they come to.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.100]   It's terrible, it's horrible.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.860]   And so, they go back to their homes,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.780]   and a few days later, or a short season later,
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.740]   they realize, oh man, we just killed everyone
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.860]   except for 600 people.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.100]   We just essentially extinguished a tribe,
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.260]   which was a big deal back then.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.660]   There were the 12 tribes, kind of think like
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.420]   the 13 colonies of America.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.700]   It'd be like, we just basically eliminated
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.180]   one of the 12, which was a big deal to God.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.020]   What are we gonna do?
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.420]   'Cause there's only 600, and they're all men.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.980]   So, they're not procreating.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.420]   And so, what are we gonna do?
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.460]   And they begin to go, man, we can't allow them
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.980]   to marry any of our daughters,
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.660]   'cause one of the things they promised, we're told,
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.300]   is that, hey, none of you guys are ever gonna marry
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.100]   any of our daughters.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.740]   And so, they begin to go, man, what should we do?
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.780]   And all of a sudden, one guy in the crowd is like,
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.620]   I got an idea.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.320]   There's only one area of the whole nation
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.940]   that wasn't here to fight with us.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.700]   I think we should go to their town,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.660]   a town named Jebashkiliya,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.180]   but I think we should go to their town,
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.820]   and we should take any of the young, unmarried women
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.220]   that we can find.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.060]   This is getting real.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.620]   This makes Game of Thrones look tame, people.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.260]   So, they go, here's with me, you with me?
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.020]   So, you got 600 people, they're out in the wilderness,
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.220]   kinda eating berries, doing whatever,
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.780]   like, hey, we got no women for us.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.960]   And then, all the rest of the tribes are like,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.940]   we gotta find 'em some women,
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.340]   or else they're gonna be extinct for forever.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.740]   So, they go to this one town,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.500]   the only town that didn't fight in the Civil War,
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.060]   and they kill everyone,
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.320]   except for the unmarried young women.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.660]   And there's only 400 of 'em.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.540]   And if you do the math, there's 600 soldiers and 400 women,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.260]   which means there's 200 guys without it.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.460]   So, they basically tell the 600 in the woods,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.220]   like, hey, we got some good news and bad news.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.060]   We got 400 women for you.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.360]   Bad news is, we're still looking for 200.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.820]   And so, they come up with another scheme,
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.980]   where somebody else in the crowd's like,
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.120]   hey, I got an idea.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.740]   This seems like a good idea.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.180]   There's a festival not far from here
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.220]   where once a year, the young, unmarried girls
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.660]   will kinda come out, and they'll celebrate,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.820]   and they'll dance.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.700]   And so, why don't you 200, this is crazy.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.300]   I cannot believe this is in the Bible.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.660]   Why don't you 200 men go over there
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.140]   into those woods over there,
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.540]   and when the girls come out here and start dancing,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.980]   you just charge in, and you grab one,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.040]   take a woman on back to your home with you,
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.340]   and that'll be your wife.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.980]   And so, it happens.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.740]   And the men line up, and they kinda like
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.020]   are waiting for the girls to come out,
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.620]   and they're just like dancing, and this is so great.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.460]   You know, fire festival, though that never happened.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.180]   And they're just like, this is gonna be awesome.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.140]   Here we are, we're hanging out,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.460]   and the guys just come out of nowhere,
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.220]   fee-fi-fo-fum, they grab a woman,
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.980]   and they run off into the woods.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.260]   And that's how the book ends.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.360]   Story over.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.740]   That's it.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.460]   I mean, literally, this is where the verse is at.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.780]   So, that's what the Benjamites did.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.160]   This is from the last verses of the book.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.720]   That's exactly what the Benjamites did.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.020]   While the young women were dancing,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.500]   each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.120]   Think about that story, telling your kids.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.860]   Let me tell you about how I met your mom, okay?
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.800]   She's out there, so I'm over there in the woods,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   covered up camo, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.980]   They carry her off, and they return to their inheritance,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.820]   they rebuild their towns, and they settled in town.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.460]   At that time, all the Israelites left,
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.940]   and they went home to their tribes and clans,
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.660]   each to his own inheritance.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.580]   Verse 25.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.200]   In those days, Israel had no king,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.940]   and everyone did what was right in their own eyes,
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.520]   or as they saw fit.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.720]   The point of the story is that exact verse at the end,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.780]   that whenever a person, a people, begin to say,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.580]   hey, you know how I'm gonna live my life,
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.560]   however I feel is right, it's tragic.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.180]   I mean, think about the story that we just read.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.500]   When you read, or when you think back about each decision
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.840]   and each moment that took place,
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.560]   it was every single person just doing,
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.740]   hey, that kinda seems right to me.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.020]   That's a good idea, we should do that.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.260]   The Levite decides, hey, they wanna get after me,
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.740]   I'm just gonna send her out.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.100]   That seems right to me.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.780]   If she hadn't ran away or cheated on me,
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.140]   I wouldn't even be in this situation.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.260]   That seems right.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.820]   It's not right, but it seems right to him.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.180]   That's kinda like what I feel like I should do.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.260]   The men outside of the town are like,
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.540]   hey, this guy, what's he doing in here?
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.700]   I wanna have sex with him.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.700]   They're doing what seemed right to them.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.500]   Then the guy is thinking,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.100]   how am I gonna get the attention of a nation
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.660]   that killed my concubine?
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.620]   I'll cut her up and send her all over the place,
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.420]   as horrific as that is, 'cause that seemed right.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.060]   That made sense.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.580]   That's what I feel like I should do.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.980]   Then the nation comes together and they're like,
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.020]   we can't stand for this.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.120]   We're gonna kill everyone in Benjamin.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.200]   That feels just.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.340]   It feels like fair to me, it seems right.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.460]   Then on and on and on.
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.220]   Then hey, we need to find husbands,
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.500]   I'm sorry, wives for these men.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.540]   Let's just go take 'em from those people.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.740]   How are we gonna get these other 200?
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.500]   Every turn, if you were to replay the story,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   it's just one person after the next doing like,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.740]   hey, this is what I feel like I should do in this moment,
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.700]   so I'm gonna do it.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.900]   The book is setting up, and really,
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.060]   the whole purpose of the book is to set up the idea
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.380]   that in those days, it was the wild, wild west.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.260]   There was no king that was providing reign
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.260]   and rule and law and order.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.140]   Yet today, we live in a time where the message of judges,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.060]   I don't know if it could ever be more relevant
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.780]   or has ever been more relevant,
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.900]   at least in my life in America.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.260]   A time where consistently, the loudest message that I hear,
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.860]   or I feel like is constantly put in front of us
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.820]   from culture, is hey, you do you.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.420]   Do whatever you feel like.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.100]   No one can tell you who to be.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.980]   No one can tell you what gender you are.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.740]   No one can tell you how to have sex.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.660]   No one can tell you what to do with a child.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.300]   No one can tell you what to do with your body.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.980]   No one can tell you what to do, you do you.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   If it's not right for them,
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.500]   that doesn't mean it doesn't have to be right for you.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.420]   In the nation of Israel,
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.740]   in the message of the book of Judges,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.100]   God said I want you to preserve because it is catastrophic
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.580]   if people decide that the moral compass,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.460]   how am I gonna live my life?
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.220]   However I feel.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.900]   He says any time that people do that,
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.020]   it is catastrophic for that individual,
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.740]   for everyone around them, and for a society as a whole,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.180]   and we are seeing it take place.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.540]   So I wanna just cover briefly because here's the truth.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.260]   As crazy as that kind of stuff sounds,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.980]   like man, how would they do that?
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.660]   They hide in the woods, they run out and grab girls.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.020]   There is still levels at which,
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.940]   in my heart, in your heart, in our world,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.340]   we like to be those who do whatever seems right in our eyes.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.460]   Kind of whatever seems to make sense, whatever's logical,
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.100]   or said in other ways, most commonly,
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.380]   hey, just kind of follow your heart, follow your desires,
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.940]   wherever they may take you.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.940]   So I just wanna lay out what that looks like today
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.860]   in our world and some of the consequences,
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.340]   and then what it looks like when you submit
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.120]   or surrender to God as the king of your heart.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.260]   So the first idea I just wanna cover,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.660]   we're just gonna do two points,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.140]   and then we're gonna land the plane really quickly here
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.140]   to set up the series.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.460]   But the first idea that I wanna take
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.140]   is what it looks like when your heart is king.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.180]   When you make your heart king,
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.180]   here's some of the ways that you know
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.060]   that you've made your heart king,
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.900]   and here's some of the ways that you see people living out,
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.700]   and by heart, I just mean the desires that you have.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.780]   The heart in the Old Testament,
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.140]   and really in the Bible, is synonymous.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.940]   You make decisions on your emotions,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.980]   your desires, your feelings.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.000]   And here's how you know that you're someone
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.180]   who is following their heart,
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.700]   following what seems right to them.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.860]   On an individual level, we see lots of examples
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.940]   of saying like, man, this is kinda what I think seems right,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.520]   and that's around the way that people perceive
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.100]   or people see sexuality.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.500]   How do I know that I'm someone who sees
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.860]   and who's just kinda living not according to what God says,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   but according to what seems right to me?
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.820]   If in the area of sexuality, I think, you know what?
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.700]   Dude, I would never buy a car without test driving at first.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.120]   Why would I date or why would I marry someone
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.640]   without first having sex with them?
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.680]   I need to make sure that we're sexually compatible.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.760]   That would be crazy.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.540]   Of course I wouldn't buy a car without test driving.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.200]   How could I get married without sleeping together?
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   You're someone who's doing whatever is right
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.500]   in your own eyes, who is thinking about it
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.240]   not as God's word says, but just kinda like,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.840]   if you begin to think like, oh yeah,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.660]   that kinda makes sense to me,
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.960]   you are beginning to think
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.880]   like the people in the nation of judges.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.500]   And God has consistently said,
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.420]   anytime someone begins to live according
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.660]   to what seems right in their own eyes,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.860]   it always has catastrophic consequences.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.340]   And if the way that you perceive sexuality is,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.180]   hey, you know what?
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.780]   I just feel like this is right for me.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.100]   Let me define something really quick.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.140]   How do you know you're sexually compatible?
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.540]   If you are a man and she is a woman,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.140]   you are sexually compatible.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.620]   I'm gonna say that again because it feels like
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.680]   this is getting crazier and crazier in this world today.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.380]   If you are a man, do I need to use anatomy
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.340]   or get a chart up here?
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.220]   If you're a man and she's a woman,
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.280]   you're sexually compatible.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.600]   It's true.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.480]   Well, what if our sex life is not off the chain
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.040]   all the time, amazing, it won't be.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.100]   Newsflash, it won't be.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.800]   It's a fact.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.400]   And if you think that it is, you are living in la-la land.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.460]   You are delusional.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.080]   And if you're someone who thinks like, man,
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.040]   this has gotta be a part of it,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.960]   you have begun to think like someone who thinks,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.780]   who lives according to what the heart tells 'em
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.460]   and acts at least in the area of sexuality
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.020]   according to what seems right in their own eyes.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.720]   Another one, very common, very related,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.980]   is the idea of, hey, living together.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.460]   Of course we need to live together.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.500]   We need to make sure that we can spend
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.340]   that much time together.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.960]   Before we get married, I don't wanna have a broken home,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.100]   I don't wanna get a divorce.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.340]   We need to make sure that we move in together.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.980]   It just makes sense, we can save on rent.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.620]   You have begun to think not like God thinks,
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.680]   but like the people in the book of Judges think,
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.620]   and you've begun to think, man, I'm gonna follow
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.080]   whatever desires that I have.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.040]   Tragically, as if God's word wasn't enough,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.140]   even statistically, or even psychology and sociology
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.220]   would say that the rate of you,
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.740]   the likelihood of you breaking up
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.100]   goes to the roof when you move in together.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.220]   Significantly more than those who preserve purity,
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.040]   who walk and date according to God's word.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.200]   But if that wasn't enough, there's scripture,
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.100]   I mean, Hebrews 13, verse four says,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.620]   to keep the marriage bed undefiled.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.820]   And if you're like, hey, we live together,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.100]   we don't have sex together, that's probably even worse.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.320]   Because you are training yourself,
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.220]   hey, we're gonna live together and not have sex together,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.280]   which is not a great recipe for marriage.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.300]   And if you've begun to think like,
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.780]   hey, of course we need to live together,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.300]   you should be concerned.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.760]   On a societal level, what does it look like
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.200]   to be someone who follows, or the heart is their king?
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.900]   As a society, we have embraced, man, tragic things
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.260]   that mirror the horror that you see in the book of Judges,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.180]   where you look and you're like, how did you kill that woman?
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.780]   One of the ways that I mean that
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.840]   is around the area of abortion.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.820]   And this isn't meant to be shameful or anything,
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.100]   that's a part of your story.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.500]   There's so much grace and hope,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.020]   and whatever God's gonna do in your life,
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.140]   I'm confident it's gonna be big and amazing.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.860]   He's not done with you, he's crazy about you.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.540]   And he wants to take your story
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.740]   and make it an incredible testimony for him.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.460]   There's no past that's a problem for him.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.100]   But in terms of legislation,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.140]   think about where our country's headed.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.120]   We're in the name of, hey, this seems right to me.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.260]   I mean, if it's a woman, she should be able to have,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.780]   you know, her body, her choice,
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.820]   she could do whatever she wants with it, up to nine months.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.440]   Even if it's like about to be delivered, if it's her body,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.960]   she shouldn't have to carry,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.020]   or she shouldn't have to care for a child
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.980]   if she doesn't want to.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.700]   I mean, what if it was some random guy in the bar,
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.540]   are you telling me that like just one mistake,
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.860]   she's gonna have to have this child?
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   You're gonna ruin two lives because of this?
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.220]   Think about that thinking.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.480]   Because the conclusion is, you're gonna ruin two lives?
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.280]   No, let's just kill one life.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.820]   And if that child was three months old,
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.500]   we would all go, that's horrific.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.940]   What is the difference between a nine month old
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.060]   and a one month old?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.180]   Or a three months old?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.380]   But our society has embraced thinking that like,
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.020]   hey, look, who am I to judge?
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.300]   You know, that seems right to me, it seems fair,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.380]   it seems like they should have the right
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.480]   to make that decision.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:59.180]   And it is tragic, as tragic as it was in the days of judges.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.940]   Around the idea of gender,
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.660]   anytime that you make the heart or feelings God,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.940]   when you don't pursue the heart of God,
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.660]   but you make your heart a God,
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.780]   that whatever I feel like, whatever my heart identifies as,
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.580]   then I'm gonna pursue that.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.060]   It always, it either ends up in chaos
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.820]   or a cage of enslaving yourself,
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.980]   'cause I'm gonna do whatever I want,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.860]   even if it makes me move in the direction
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.600]   of being in bondage to the things that I want.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.440]   Or it ends up with just like straight up crazy,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.840]   like some of the stuff that our nation is embracing
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.800]   is crazy.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.420]   Maybe the most American city in our country,
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.540]   or at least the largest and at least the most diverse
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.860]   and represented in all that stuff would be what city?
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.720]   New York City.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.820]   Do you know how many genders are recognized in New York City?
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.280]   31.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.140]   On NewYorkCity.gov, this is what NewYorkCity.gov shows
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.380]   as the official genders that you can be a part of
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.300]   by gender, cross-gender, drag king, drag queen,
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.700]   femme, queen, fem, no male, FTM, whatever that means,
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.480]   gender bender, gender queer.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.300]   This almost reads like a Saturday Night Live skit,
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.860]   and I'm not trying to be offensive or anything,
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.940]   I'm saying like this is insane.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   And we didn't pull this from like NewYorksersCrazy.com,
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.740]   we pulled it from NYC.gov.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.460]   And yet this is the insanity that comes when it's like,
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.820]   hey, what defines male and female is not a penis
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.740]   and a vagina, it is what do you feel like?
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.020]   Butch, which is one of 'em, do you feel like a man?
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.620]   Do you feel like a, what do you feel like?
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.060]   And I'm not trying to cast judgment on anyone,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.300]   if they found themselves at a place,
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.340]   we'd love to talk and engage in that conversation,
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.760]   I'm saying that when you begin to say the heart is God,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.140]   rather than pursuing the heart of God,
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.460]   you end up with craziness and chaos,
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.460]   and often in a cage of your own making.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.820]   What do I mean by a cage of that?
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.700]   Think about any, if you've ever,
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.500]   if you've ever experienced addiction,
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.820]   or if you've ever had someone in your life
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.100]   that experiences addiction,
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.820]   the way that you end up in that cage of that addiction,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.540]   that bondage, that slavery, is by expressing your freedom,
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.340]   you in pursuing the things that you want to do,
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.440]   and this is awesome, and desire to do this,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.520]   all of a sudden, at some point, you move in the direction
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.920]   where you trade in your freedom card for a slavery card,
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.720]   and you're no longer free.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.120]   You can't go without alcohol.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.500]   You can't go, if anyone like me has ever dipped in the past,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.300]   where you're like, man, I no longer can go without dip.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.040]   Until you at least reach some point where you're like,
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.320]   hey man, I'm cutting that off,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.580]   because I'm no longer free from this, or pornography.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.440]   Or maybe it's a codependency in a relationship,
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.140]   whatever, fill in the blank, an eating disorder.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.020]   Or anytime you say, I'm just gonna go with what I feel like,
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.940]   it leads to craziness, and chaos,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.620]   and oftentimes, a cage of our own making, own desire.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.540]   Sin will always take you farther than you want to go,
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.220]   cost you more than you want to pay,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.360]   and keep you longer than you want to stay.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.340]   Sin always takes you farther than you want to go,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.540]   costs you more than you ever wanted to pay,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.020]   and keeps you longer than you ever wanted to stay.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.500]   And the message of the book of Judges
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.420]   is that if you as a nation, or as a person,
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.760]   wherever you compromise, you at risk being conquered.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.040]   Whatever you compromise in, you risk being conquered.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.540]   And God said, I want you to preserve it for my people,
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.640]   so that they would not allow their heart to be God,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.800]   and do whatever they see is right
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.940]   to lead and direct their life.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.600]   The second idea is, hey, what does it look like
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.960]   when God is the king of your heart?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.880]   Here's what's fascinating.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.620]   So 100 years later, so the book of Judges ends,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.760]   and it sets the stage for like, hey, we need a king,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.160]   'cause we are crazy.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.120]   And so they cry out to God, we need a king, we need a king.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.680]   Three kings in, a guy named Solomon,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.000]   with this right in the rear view mirror,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.400]   begins to think about this idea,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.640]   and he begins to think about the heart,
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.880]   and what leads and directs people,
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.000]   and he says, man, it's not that you should listen
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.040]   to what you think is right, listen to what your heart says,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.840]   and he writes this proverb,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.140]   in Proverbs chapter three, verse five and six,
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.040]   that really instructs the way that as believers,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.880]   we're to think about how to live our life,
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.400]   how to make decisions, how to inform ourselves,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.560]   and how to live, he says this in Proverbs chapter five,
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.000]   or chapter three, verse five.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.840]   "Trust in the Lord with all of your heart."
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.720]   Don't trust in your heart, don't trust in your desires,
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.080]   don't trust in your emotions, take all of those emotions,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.120]   those feelings, desires, the things that are inside of you,
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.920]   and surrender and trust those to God.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.600]   What does that look like, Solomon?
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.060]   Glad you asked, he would say.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:32.200]   "Lean not on your own understanding,
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.040]   "and what you think you should do,"
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.560]   is another way of saying that,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   "but in every way, submit to him,"
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.480]   or in all of your ways, submit to God,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.960]   submit to God's word, submit to what God's word says,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.480]   and what's gonna happen if you do that?
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.760]   He will make straight your paths,
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.840]   he will make straight your life,
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.680]   he will bring you to a place where all of a sudden,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.400]   the life that you have is not all jacked up and messed up,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.200]   he will bring you to a place that is the life that you want,
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.240]   where you're not experiencing bondage in every direction,
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.960]   and chaos, and relational dysfunction,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.880]   and one breakup after the next, after the next,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.480]   after the next, ending up with one loser,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   or one, I don't know how to say loser, loser,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.240]   after the next.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:18.780]   But it's gonna involve you taking your thoughts,
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.840]   and taking those desires, and taking those emotions,
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.620]   and not saying, "You know what, maybe I should do these,
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.980]   "50/50, split 'em," but saying,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.020]   "God, I take all of these, and I surrender to you.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.640]   "Whatever your word says about any arena,
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.160]   "I'm gonna try to submit my life to it.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.740]   "I'm not gonna do it perfectly,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.840]   "and I'm gonna invite other people,
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.080]   "if they see my life not living consistent with your word,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.780]   "not submitting my ways to him,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.320]   "I'm gonna invite them to come into my life and speak,
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.480]   "and say, 'Hey, I see this,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.320]   "'the way that you're handling marriage,
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.440]   "'the way that you're handling dating,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.780]   "'the way that you're thinking about sexuality,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.340]   "'or alcohol, or work, or money,
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.620]   "'if they point out any of the ways
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.720]   "'that I'm not living consistent with your Bible,
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.120]   "'the Scriptures, with God's word, your teachings,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.420]   "'where I'm not submitting to you,'
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.680]   "I want them to call that out,
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.040]   "because I wanna have, at the end of the day,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.700]   "a life that is made straight,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.680]   "that is not full of brokenness in every direction,
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.640]   "that's a life that I think everyone in this room
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.040]   "would say, 'Man, that's the type of future
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.440]   "'I would love to have,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.720]   "'not one where I look, and I'm 58 years old,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.080]   "'and I still act like I'm the frat daddy.'"
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.840]   I mean, everyone has seen that person in their life,
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.140]   they're like, "Dude, you never left college,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.200]   "like, you are still living for that keg stand, dude."
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.040]   It's true.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.820]   And they've gone through one broken relationship,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.000]   and one divorce after the next,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.120]   is that the person you're gonna be?
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.760]   And here's the remedy, here's the key,
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.440]   because every one of us is gonna walk out of this room,
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.520]   and you have a heart.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.160]   There is a GPS inside of you, called a heart,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.420]   and it is broken.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.200]   Jeremiah chapter 17, verse nine, says that,
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.880]   "The heart is deceitful above everything."
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.280]   Think about that.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.240]   "It is utterly sick beyond cure."
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.680]   That's exactly the verse.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.440]   Jeremiah 17, verse nine, that the heart is deceitful.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.920]   You have something inside of you that is a broken GPS.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.120]   I don't know if you've ever had an iPhone
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   that has like an off GPS, it's a really frustrating thing.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.040]   Or an Android, for our Android people.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.580]   You guys have Maps on there?
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.160]   How you gonna stop hating on Android?
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.760]   This is great, I love Androids.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.080]   Don't email me.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.800]   If you've ever had a phone that has a broken map,
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.200]   where you're like, "Hey, this is telling me right now
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.740]   "that I'm at the American Airlines Center,
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.000]   "and that's really frustrating, 'cause I know,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.400]   "I don't know a lot, but I at least know
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.980]   "that I'm not there.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.960]   "And so in order for me to move in any direction,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.440]   "I've gotta be able to know where I am,
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.900]   "I've gotta know where I need to go,
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.240]   "and have something that can guide and lead and direct me."
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.920]   That is what God's word is meant to be.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.220]   That you are not to listen to the things
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.440]   inside of your heart, because your heart,
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.400]   according to the Bible, is utterly sick and beyond cure,
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.720]   in need of curing.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.520]   And that curing can only happen in walking with Jesus,
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.560]   and he has given you instructions and teachings,
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.960]   not for you to make the heart God,
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.820]   not for you to make your heart and your desires king,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.100]   but for you to make him, God, the king of your heart,
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.560]   and submit all of your ways to him.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.740]   And he promises, if you will do that,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.440]   as it relates to dating, to sex, to money,
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.440]   to alcohol, to friends, whatever you submit,
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.640]   I will make it straight.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.580]   Whatever you submit to me,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.860]   whatever you entrust to my care,
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.200]   I will lead you to straight paths,
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.580]   to a life full of freedom and blessing and peace.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.840]   But whatever you hold onto,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.480]   you're working with a broken GPS, so good luck.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.600]   That's what the message of the book of Judges is.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.660]   Every time that we see this,
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.060]   I mean, this happens in all of our lives.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.140]   If you talk to any of us down front,
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.580]   afterwards, any of the volunteers that work here,
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.580]   all of our staff that's candidly on staff,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.340]   is every one of us just has a past full of brokenness.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.100]   Where God has come in,
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.420]   and we were formerly trying to be our own king,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.300]   and our heart was the thing that made our decisions,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.000]   and that's what we followed in life.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.380]   And at some point, God, in his grace,
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.140]   just kinda got ahold of us, and we were like,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.460]   man, I believe Jesus is who he says he is.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.860]   He's the savior of the world.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.700]   He died for my sins,
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.420]   he paid for everything I ever did on the cross,
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.740]   he rose from the dead, and we accept and believe that,
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.780]   and I can have eternal life,
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.280]   not 'cause I'm a good person, 'cause what he did.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.900]   And we begin to walk and live out
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.020]   according to the scriptures, and it changed everything.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.700]   I was talking with a few friends today,
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.540]   and a few of them were sharing their story,
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.060]   and I just wrote 'em down,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.660]   where it said, this is from my friend Mark,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.700]   he said, "I was following my heartburn,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.220]   "I ended up divorced, and then committing an affair
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.020]   "afterwards with one of my friend's wife for a year.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.940]   "I was depressed, I was broken,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.620]   "and in the midst of all that,
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.580]   "somebody sent me a message, and I listened,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.340]   "and I heard the gospel, my life was changed.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.000]   "I married another woman, I'm walking with Jesus,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.340]   "my life has been radically changed."
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.180]   Another friend was saying,
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.220]   "That hey, I followed my heart,
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.340]   "and it led me to constantly needing approval of others
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.180]   "to weed alcohol, a string of destruction
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.380]   "that led me to have an abortion eventually.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.740]   "But with Jesus and him coming in,
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.000]   "and him being king over my heart,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.620]   "I found the love that I was searching for,
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.420]   "I feel free, and I'm not living for my glory,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.260]   "but for his."
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.440]   Another said that, "Hey, I followed my heart
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.540]   "into partying, into drinking, into drugs, depression,
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.540]   "and I was constantly looking for the next high.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.740]   "It was never enough.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.060]   "And then Jesus came in as king of my heart,
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.320]   "and I found freedom, I found life to the full,
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.660]   "what I had never known before.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.700]   "I feel known and fully loved by the God who created me."
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:09.180]   Whatever you hold onto is something where you're saying,
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.980]   "God, I want the broken GPS to guide my life, not you."
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.880]   And you are saying to the God who's there,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.460]   "Hey, I want crooked, broken paths,
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.560]   "not straight, peaceful, healed ones."
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.100]   But he's invited you just like he invited the people
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.540]   in the book of Judges.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.980]   Will you surrender and submit to me?
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.820]   That was the whole message,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.300]   the point of the book of Judges was God,
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.720]   who gave them the law, said, "Hey, will you walk with me?
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.640]   "I want you to not be ruled by a king.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.540]   "I want you to be ruled by me, God," he said to them.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.160]   And yet they rejected him and said, "We don't want that."
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.020]   Eventually they said, "We want a king."
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.740]   And in the next books ahead,
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.760]   and maybe we'll teach those someday,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.840]   they basically, they finally got a king.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.380]   And they got one king after the next, after the next.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.140]   Here's what they all had in common.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.340]   They were imperfect rulers, they were broken,
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.620]   and the nation rebelled and didn't want them as king
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.300]   over and over and over again, because they put laws.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.540]   But here's what every earthly king couldn't do,
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.580]   and it was all setting up the king of kings to come,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.100]   which is Jesus.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.780]   Every earthly king would always rule
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.580]   from the outside with law.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.540]   And Jesus came, and it was a foreshadowing
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.700]   all throughout the Old Testament.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.180]   There will one day come a king
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.820]   who will rule from the inside,
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.720]   not through the law, but through love.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.760]   And to the people, the nation of Israel,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.840]   through the book of Judges, he said,
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.760]   "If you allow your heart to reign, your heart to rule,
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.140]   "you will lead yourself off a cliff.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.380]   "But if you allowed me."
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.840]   And eventually what they would see
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.640]   is the love that he had for them displayed on a cross.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.180]   You will lead yourself to life.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.240]   I'll close here, and then the band can come up.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:53.160]   When I was in college, I spent like a month
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.240]   or a little bit over a month in this village
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.720]   in West Uganda.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.920]   And while I was there, we had a chance
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.120]   to go rafting on the Nile River, which was awesome.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.160]   It was crazy.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.300]   And we went rafting, and one day we set out,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.640]   and we're going down, and there's these class five rapids,
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.880]   which are just big.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   And eventually, we kinda get to this cliff
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.040]   and this waterfall, if you will, a small one,
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.600]   and we head down, and we get smashed up against a rock,
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.140]   and we're stuck.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:21.980]   And we're beginning to go like,
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.820]   "Hey, man, we can't stay here.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.400]   "There's gotta be water that's filling up the raft.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.440]   "We've gotta do something."
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.120]   And it's literally kinda getting boomeranged
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.720]   around this rock, and we're wondering,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.560]   "What do we do?"
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.000]   And we kinda move to the front, and we move to the back,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.960]   and how do we get off of this thing?
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.920]   And all of a sudden, one of the guides comes up,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.200]   and he jumps onto the rock,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.560]   and he begins to tell us what to do.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.060]   And he begins to say, "Hey, here's what you need to do,
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.360]   "and move over here."
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.760]   In that moment, we all had a decision.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.840]   There's like six of us on the raft.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.480]   We could go like, "Hey, man, what do you know, okay?
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.540]   "We've been here trying to get this thing worked out.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.860]   "We've been here trying to get off of this rock,
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.700]   "and all of a sudden, you show up.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.800]   "You think you can just tell us what to do?"
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.380]   Or we could say, "You are our guide.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.220]   "You do this every day.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.980]   "You know exactly what you're doing.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.880]   "And so I'm gonna trust you
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.000]   "because we don't want to be stuck here.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.260]   "And so I have the choice, and we have the choice.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.880]   "Are we gonna do what he says, submit, and say,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.520]   "All right, nothing else has worked.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.600]   "I'll try that?
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.540]   "Or are we gonna say, man, that may work for you.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.080]   "That doesn't work for me?"
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.120]   And of course, in that moment,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.480]   we're on a raft in the middle of the Nile.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.880]   We're gonna do what he said.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   Some of you in the room, the God of the universe
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.260]   is speaking to you and saying,
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.600]   "Hey, if you want to get unstuck, there is a way.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.520]   "No matter what you're in,
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.600]   "no matter what you're walking through,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.300]   "no matter what you feel like, you're stuck in right now.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.960]   "There is a path towards freedom.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.320]   "Whether it's pornography, whether it's drug addiction,
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.220]   "whether it is alcohol,
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.440]   "whether it's a just broken string of relationships,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.960]   "whether it is self-hate,
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.640]   "the God who's there doesn't want you
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.140]   "to continue to be unhealed,
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.220]   "and he's not gonna fully heal you in a moment, in a second.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.020]   "But by his Spirit, that's the process
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.660]   "that Jesus brings all Christians through,
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.740]   "where he says, hey, if you want to get unstuck,
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.360]   "there is a guide.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.900]   "There is one, Jesus, who by his Spirit,
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.700]   "his Word, and his people, wants to set you free.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.860]   "And when you get stuck again,
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.800]   "he wants to be there to set you free.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.480]   "That's the journey of the Christian life.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.060]   "And the question for you and me is not,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:13.940]   "is there a guide there?
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.680]   "It's will you submit to him?
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.580]   "Are you gonna listen to him?
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.680]   "Are you gonna keep holding on, thinking,
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.140]   "you know what, I know better than you.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.040]   "You may be God, you may know all of the universe
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.460]   "and everything, but I think that I know better,
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.420]   "or I don't really care that much right now.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.780]   "I think that my way is probably just as good."
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.280]   You know how arrogant that is?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.320]   That's like my three-year-old son,
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.640]   when we're driving in the car, and he's like,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.300]   "Hey, are you sure you know where you're going, Dad?"
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.020]   Yeah, you can't spell car.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.780]   And you're gonna give me a lecture?
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.260]   It's ridiculous.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.740]   The eternal God of the universe who made you,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.560]   who knows exactly the number of hairs on your head,
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.740]   and you're gonna say, "I think my way is just as good.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.300]   "I'm gonna hold on to it."
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.460]   Are you gonna submit to the guy, the one who's crazy about you
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.660]   who stretched out his arms to die for you?
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.660]   Whatever you're stuck in, there is a path towards healing.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.420]   But it takes you waving the white flag and saying,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.080]   "Man, I submit.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.720]   "I'm willing, I wanna be unstuck
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.940]   "more than I want to hold on to this."
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.020]   I wanna be free.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.960]   The choice is yours.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.360]   It's all of ours, every day.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.060]   Let me pray.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   Father, I pray for my friends in the room
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.180]   who are stuck in the shadows of shame,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.380]   of a past decision that they made
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.220]   that they've never told anyone about.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.940]   That you would pierce through those shadows with light,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.620]   and they would open up and have a conversation.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.500]   They would be willing to come forward
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.100]   and talk to a friend or talk to another believer
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.940]   in their life.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.780]   Maybe it's someone who's walking through
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.620]   and they're in shackles right now,
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.660]   and they know it and they won't admit it.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:54.460]   But the desire to be free would be more real
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.660]   or more overwhelming
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.980]   than the desire to come out in fear
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.220]   of what that may look like.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.860]   Father, would you help us to walk with you,
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.900]   to submit to the guy?
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.460]   Would you take more ground in my life,
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.620]   the areas of my heart,
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.460]   where I'm prone to act like the people
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.420]   in the nation of Israel
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.420]   and not submit to the one true King?
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.340]   Or submit my heart to him, God?
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.540]   Would you help us to know you, to love you?
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.600]   I pray for anyone in this room
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.220]   who's never put their faith in Jesus.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.260]   They've never accepted the free gift of eternal life.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.300]   God, tonight that would change forever.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.440]   They would forever be changed
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.700]   because they would accept that you're not demanding
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.220]   them do a bunch of good things for them.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.620]   You did something on their behalf.
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.580]   You're not demanding something from them.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.660]   You did something for them.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.780]   You're giving your life
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.540]   so they wouldn't have to work their way to you.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.520]   They could have relationship with you
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.120]   that tonight they'd accept that.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.780]   Thank you for preserving the message
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.320]   in the book of Judges,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.180]   that when we do what seems right to us,
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.460]   there are consequences.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.280]   But because of the cross,
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.580]   we can walk with our King
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.620]   and experience straight paths
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.180]   where that take place, amen.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
