[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.440]   - All right, what is up guys?
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.480]   We are back, that is right, with another week of Esther.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000]   We are in the quarantine Corona edition,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720]   but I am with my friend, JD Rogers.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.560]   What's up everyone?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.380]   - This is part of leadership here,
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.120]   and we're gonna dive back into Esther chapter five and six.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.000]   - So excited.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.320]   - How we doing, man?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.160]   - Pretty good.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.500]   This is the first time I've been in the proximity
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.880]   of another human in quite a while.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.720]   It's been nice.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.400]   I've been making dance videos at home alone.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   - Hey, we are, yes he has.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.120]   We gotta give him more to do.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.480]   We are six feet apart, don't worry.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.100]   We got the hand sanitizer ready.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.000]   We're gonna about to open the scripture,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800]   but hey, let me start by this.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   This will be a question for you.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680]   What is your favorite Disney movie ever?
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.080]   You at home, you can comment below
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   if you're on YouTube live,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.600]   or if you're listening wherever you are,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.500]   you can comment there.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.960]   What's the greatest Disney movie of all time?
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.360]   Disney or Pixar?
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.080]   - You know, David, I'd have to say for me,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.160]   Emperor's New Groove.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   - Ah.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   - It's my favorite.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.720]   - Emperor's New Groove is actually a really strong movie.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.760]   - It's so good.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   Yzma is the most underrated villain in the game.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.080]   - Yzma.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.240]   - Yzma, she's hilarious.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.780]   - The scene with the angel and the devil
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.920]   on the shoulders things,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.400]   and he's like, no, he's actually got a good point.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   - He's like, no, no, no, look what I can do.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.200]   He does like the handstand.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   - Hey, we have been watching all kinds of,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960]   this is going somewhere, by the way.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.400]   In my house, with little kids,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.760]   Disney+ is like your saving grace.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.360]   And so our kids have gotten reacquainted,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120]   not just with like the recent movies,
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.840]   like Toy Story 4, or the 1-4,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   but in Cars and Frozen and all that stuff.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   But it's like, I'm taking them down memory lane,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.240]   'cause we're going through Aladdin, Mulan.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.280]   - That's my time.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.880]   - Oh, dude, so the time.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.720]   Pocahontas.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.960]   - What were you, like 25 on Aladdin?
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.760]   - Oh my gosh, wow, wow.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   I actually don't really know.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.320]   But I do know that I think the greatest Disney movie
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.760]   of all time, I'm going on record,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.840]   you say it right here, Lion King.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.760]   The original Lion King.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.800]   â™« Circle of life
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.280]   - So strong.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.000]   So anyways, that is like our jam right now.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.200]   We're watching that all the time.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   And you know, it's funny, when you watch them as an adult,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.160]   you see all the underlying messages
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.640]   that are being woven into the storyline
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.920]   that your kids are being fed,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.000]   which is like, one, a kind of perspective on the world
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.560]   that you wish was true, you wish there was a magic carpet
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   that you could take and show you the world,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.880]   but is not really the case.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.800]   And also that lions, or even the animal kingdom
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.960]   in Lion King, that it's not really reality
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.000]   that all the lions get along with a baboon
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.160]   and kind of they're all friends together.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.880]   There's some clearly, hey, this is not,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   there's a lot of myth and fairy tale
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.920]   that is woven in there.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   And as a dad, you're like, hey, this is great,
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.800]   and you want to spark creativity and imagination,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920]   but at some point they're going to grow up
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.560]   and hopefully realize that life doesn't always work
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   where there's a, whatever the movie.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   - Akuma Tata.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   - There's not always, it doesn't always work out
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.400]   the way you want it to.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.640]   Prince Charming doesn't always show up
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.040]   and give you a kiss that awakes sleeping beauty from death.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.400]   - If you try to fly off a cliff with a magic carpet.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.440]   - It's not going to happen, not going to go well for you.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.920]   And how crazy it would be, as simple as that is
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   for an adult or for a child to grow up
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.360]   and never actually learn that those things
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.320]   are fairy tales, that they're myths.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.120]   What does that have to do with Esther chapter five and six,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.280]   where we're looking tonight?
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.560]   I think there's a lot of people who grow their entire life.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.520]   And from some point early on,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.360]   or at some point in their life journey,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.320]   they embrace what I would say is a fairy tale faith,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.160]   or these myths about faith
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800]   and what true faith actually looks like.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.480]   And they never grow out of it.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.160]   Things that just like as silly as it would be to believe,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.520]   happily ever after, or the circle of life
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.120]   always ends up with animals all being best friends.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.600]   There's also these different myths about your faith
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   that if you and I are not careful,
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.760]   and candidly, I think a lot of people listening,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   a lot of the people that we minister to,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   thousands of young adults every single week,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.560]   as I get to know and just hear conversations
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.480]   and I'm talking with them, at some point I'll realize,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.520]   oh, you have a version of faith that is not true faith.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.240]   It's a fairy tale version.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.720]   And so tonight I just want to pull out three examples
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   of fairy tale faith that are really common
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.600]   among young adults, the right in the story.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720]   And so we're going to dive into Esther chapter five
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.680]   and look at those three.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.120]   So tonight, if you take notes, first week one,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.200]   let me just set up where we've been,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.920]   'cause you may not have joined us for Esther.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.680]   Esther is a book in the Old Testament.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.360]   It's Old Testament is the basically storyline
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.480]   of the people of God, nation of Israel.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.600]   That's what the Old Testament is primarily about.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.280]   And God's kind of inter relationship with those people.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.360]   Inside of that book or inside of the Old Testament,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.560]   there's a book called Esther.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.000]   Esther was the queen of all of the Persian kingdom.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.840]   How did that happen?
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.200]   Basically, crazy story.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   You can go back and listen on porch app or the podcast
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.920]   to hear the messages of Esther week one and two.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.200]   Basically, she was a peasant girl.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   It's the ultimate, like Disney should make a movie about it.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.480]   - It's like a very slept on book in the Bible.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.320]   - Oh, dude, totally.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.800]   - People need to, if you haven't read Esther, now's the time.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.680]   - Amazing.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.560]   So girl goes rags to riches.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.800]   She's a peasant girl.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.440]   The king gets rid of his wife and is like,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   I want a new wife, beauty competition.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.240]   They have the bachelor Persia edition.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.600]   She wins the bachelor Persia.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   She goes from peasant to the palace.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.280]   All of a sudden, she's at the right hand of the king.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.400]   Yeah, that just came out.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.680]   And that was week one.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.040]   We looked at kind of like all the ways that God,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.440]   despite really her not perfect behavior
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.360]   or the ways that she and the other characters in the story
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.960]   weren't always living out the way that God was still at work.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.920]   And then last week we were introduced
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.320]   to the villain in the story.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.160]   - Two weeks ago.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   - Two weeks ago.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   Yeah, listening.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.160]   And we were introduced to the villain in the story.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.920]   So let me go through the four main characters
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.160]   in case you're still not following me.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.600]   There's really four main characters in the book.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.760]   There's King Xerxes.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.560]   He's king over the whole Persian empire.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.280]   He's not a believer in God.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.400]   I said Jake Gyllenhaal when I think of him, there he is.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.240]   You can see him.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.880]   There's King Xerxes.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.200]   He is the guy who says,
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.320]   I want a beauty competition to marry my new wife.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   And he finds Esther who becomes the queen.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.120]   And when I think of Esther,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.960]   here's what I think of.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.800]   I think of Wonder Woman.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.360]   She's kind of the Wonder Woman of the show.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.200]   Gal Gadot.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.040]   - Yes, queen.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.920]   - Yes, queen.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.520]   She's actually Israeli.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.240]   Gal, I think her name's Gal.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.760]   And so that's Esther.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   So we got King Xerxes, got Jake.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.480]   Then you got queen Esther, that's Gal.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.200]   Then you got uncle Mordecai.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.800]   Uncle Mordecai is the guy who raises Esther.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.920]   When I think of uncle Mordecai,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   I think of the most iconic uncle of all time in my opinion.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.480]   And who would that be?
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.440]   Jesse from Full House.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.800]   There's uncle Jesse.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.640]   Got to love.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.480]   - Everyone loves Jesse.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.840]   - Dude, look at the hair on that guy, man.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   Taking me back to my childhood.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.520]   - How could you not?
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.360]   How could you not love that guy?
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.200]   - For real.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.120]   Okay, so those are three main kind of good characters
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.080]   or at least the latter two.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   And then we have our villain of the story.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.200]   And when I think of this villain,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.040]   really for me, there's no question, it is Jafar.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   - Jafar.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.720]   - There he is.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.360]   Partly because the villain whose name is Haman
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.560]   in this story is the prime minister of all the land.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.040]   And he kind of has like the king underneath his thumb.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.080]   So week one, we talked about God being at work
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.240]   and we called it the Bachelor of Persia
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   and her being placed from peasant to the palace.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.800]   Week two, we're introduced to Jafar or Haman
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160]   who comes up with this plan to kill all of the Jewish people
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.720]   in the whole empire, millions and millions of people.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.280]   And you can go back and kind of listen
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   to why he wanted to do that.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.240]   Clearly, that was an evil thing that he was a part of,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.440]   but he gets this plan.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.880]   He's the prime minister, goes to the king,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   says, "I think we should wipe out all of the Jewish people."
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.960]   And the king's like, "Oh, okay.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.760]   And in exchange for that, I'll give you lots of money."
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.800]   And the king's like, "For sure, then we're gonna do that."
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.200]   And so really we hit pause in the midst of that.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   And we were introduced that Esther was told by her uncle,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.280]   "Hey, they're gonna kill all of us, all the Jewish people,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.080]   15 million people, every man, woman, and child
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.400]   on a fixed day in the future.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.760]   You need to go into your husband, the king,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400]   and you need to say, 'Don't kill my people.'"
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.720]   And she responds with like,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.120]   "Hey, you know that I could potentially die
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.400]   if I go in front of the king."
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.040]   And that's weird to us 'cause you're like your husband
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.680]   and wife talk about marital problems.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.600]   But in that context, if you went before the king
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.360]   without being invited, you would have your head chopped off
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.840]   or you could, unless he extended the scepter.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.640]   And Mordecai responds with the most famous line in Esther,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.960]   "Hey, maybe you've been put in the palace
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.080]   for such a time as this."
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.400]   God has woven all of the story together.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.080]   He's gonna save his people.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.040]   Could it be that he's gonna do it through you?
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.240]   And so today we're gonna pick up where Esther,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.600]   after three days of fasting, says,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.960]   "I'm going before the king."
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.480]   So we're in Esther chapter five.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.920]   If you have your Bible, you can flip open
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.760]   to Esther chapter five.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.400]   Anything that I missed or anything that'd be unclear
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.480]   in all that?
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.960]   It's about 500 years before Jesus was alive.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.520]   - No, I do think this is a very relevant story
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.560]   for kind of what's going on in each of our lives right now.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.400]   It was like, hey, I think it could be really easy
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.880]   to be passive in this season.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.760]   And I think maybe, I hope tonight,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.240]   like we hear what was the call of Esther in this moment
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.680]   of difficulty, of pushback,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.120]   and respond faithfully with the bravery that she did.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.680]   And I love that you just said that,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.920]   I forgot that even she fasted three days before this,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   that she was committed to seeking the Lord
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.640]   - Praying and fasting would be the indication, yeah.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.200]   - As she, before she goes and does this.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   It wasn't on her own strength.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.480]   It wasn't about her.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.080]   It was about what she was called to do
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.120]   for such a time as this.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.680]   And I think there's a call in our life
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.640]   for such a time as this.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.280]   So, I'm excited to see what you teach.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.120]   - All right, here we go.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.040]   Esther chapter five, verse one, three days into the fast,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.640]   it says this, "On the third day of the fast,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.280]   Esther put on her royal robes.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.720]   She entered in the court of the palace,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   just across from the King's hall.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.520]   The King was sitting on his royal throne,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.480]   facing the entrance.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.800]   When he saw Queen Esther,"
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.520]   here's the moment of truth,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.160]   "standing there in the inner court, he welcomed her.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.120]   And he held out the gold scepter to her,"
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.400]   which means, hey, you can come forward.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.760]   "So Esther approached
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   and she touched the end of the scepter."
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.160]   She did it on the third day.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.040]   She put her life out there.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.800]   She was willing to risk her life to go before the King
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   in order to say, man, they spare my people.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.240]   So he goes before the King
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.400]   and she is given permission.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   And the King asked her,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   "What do you want, Queen Esther?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.440]   What is your request?
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.480]   I will give it to you,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.080]   even if it is up to half of my kingdom."
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.800]   That's a good day right now, or right then,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.240]   when the King says, hey, whatever you want,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.520]   you can have up to half of the kingdom.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.040]   Here's how she responds.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.960]   "Esther replied, 'If it pleases the King,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   let the King and Haman come today to a banquet
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.720]   I've prepared for the King.'"
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.000]   So she says to Jake Gyllenhaal,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.280]   "Hey, King, will you and Jafar or Haman
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.880]   come to this banquet that I put together?
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.960]   That's all that I want.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.560]   I wanna have a dinner and have a banquet together.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.120]   In my opinion, if I'm the King, I'm going,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   hey, you just risked your life.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.280]   I'm pretty sure you didn't just wanna invite me to dinner,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.880]   but maybe I'll find out at the dinner what you really want."
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.200]   Verse five, "The King turned to his attendants
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.580]   and said, 'Tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.080]   Esther has requested.'
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.880]   So the King and Haman went to Esther's banquet."
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.160]   So they go to this dinner.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.200]   "While they were drinking wine, the King said to Esther,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.180]   'Now tell me what you really want.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.640]   What is your request?
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.120]   And I will give it to you,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.160]   even if it is up to half of my kingdom.'"
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.320]   I love this dude, man.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.040]   He's just quick to go,
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.920]   you know, he's pressing that half the kingdom thing.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.080]   - Yeah, really.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.000]   "Esther said, 'This is my request and deepest wish.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.960]   If I have found favor with the King,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.900]   and if it pleases the King to grant my request
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.420]   and to do what I ask,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.280]   please come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.580]   that I will prepare for you.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.180]   Then I will explain what all of this is about.'"
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.140]   So she again says, "Hey, you know what I really want?
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.620]   I want you to come to another banquet."
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.860]   And the King's going,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.820]   I'm pretty sure that's not all that you want,
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.660]   but let's do it.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.660]   I'm intrigued, I'm interested."
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.020]   So she goes and basically makes a request,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.540]   "Both you guys come back."
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.480]   Haman leaves a happy man as he left the banquet.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.640]   But when he saw Mordecai,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.020]   who was sitting at the palace gate,
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.920]   not standing up or trembling nervously before him,
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.960]   Haman became furious.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.680]   Remember, Haman was like the most powerful dude.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.200]   He wants everybody everywhere to know,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.560]   "Hey, when I'm in the room, I'm a big deal.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.840]   You should be bowing to me."
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.300]   And Mordecai, 'cause he was Jewish, was like,
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.240]   "I'm not bowing in worship to any human person."
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.760]   And that infuriated Haman.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.860]   It's why he wanted to kill all of the Jewish people,
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.840]   because he knew that, "Hey, they're not gonna bow down
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.680]   to me."
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.440]   So he goes by, sees Mordecai not bowing.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.480]   He's really angry.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   - Okay.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.840]   - However, he restrained himself and he went home.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.240]   Then Haman gathered together his friends
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.640]   and Zeresh, his wife,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.560]   and he boasted to them about his great wealth
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.000]   and his many children.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.660]   And he bragged about the honors the King had given him,
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.240]   how he'd been promoted above all the other nobles
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.480]   and officials.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.120]   Then Haman added, "And that's not all.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.300]   Queen Esther invited only me and the King himself
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.620]   to a banquet she prepared for us.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.100]   And she's invited me to dine with her
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.860]   and the King again tomorrow."
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.740]   So he goes home.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.380]   He's like, "Yeah, I'm really upset."
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.780]   In my mind, this is how I see this,
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.580]   probably just 'cause I'm watching so much Disney.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.280]   You know that scene in "Beauty and the Beast"
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.260]   when Gestan is a little down on himself
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.740]   and he begins to talk with that guy.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.980]   And he basically goes into, "No one's quick like Gestan.
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.820]   No one's whip like,"
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.940]   you know that whole thing where he's over the top.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.960]   10,000, whatever he talks about like Gestan.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.660]   This is that moment with Haman where he's going,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.360]   "Look at how many kids I have.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.700]   Look how much wealth I have.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.940]   Look at all the great things.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.180]   I'm the most powerful person next to the King.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.620]   Not only that, I've been invited to the White House
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.920]   for a dinner with the president and the first lady
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.460]   or the King and the Queen, just the two of them.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.300]   How special and amazing am I?"
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.340]   But verse 13-
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.320]   - He's feeling himself.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.500]   - He's feeling himself.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.580]   Verse 13, "But this is all worth nothing
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.740]   as long as I see Mordecai the Jew
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.660]   just sitting there at the palace gate."
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.220]   In other words, like if only,
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.540]   all of this doesn't mean anything
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.680]   'cause that guy won't bow to me.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.660]   If only he bowed to me, that would be really what I want.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.380]   So Haman's wife, Zeresh, and all of his friends suggested,
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.140]   "Set up a sharpened pole that stands 75 feet tall.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.260]   And in the morning, ask the King to impale Mordecai on it."
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.180]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.020]   - It feels aggressive.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.100]   "When this is done, you can go on your merry way
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.740]   to the banquet with the King."
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.220]   And this pleased Haman and he ordered the pole set up.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.080]   Okay, so really interesting.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.780]   His wife, he's like, "How great I am,
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.980]   and yet I'm so upset.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.940]   It doesn't mean anything 'cause this guy won't bow."
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.300]   And his wife is like, "Let me console you.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   How about a little murder?
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.740]   I think that'll make you feel better.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.440]   And so why don't you set up a 75 foot pole
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.900]   and have Mordecai impaled on it?
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.780]   I mean, you're the prime minister of the land.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.900]   You could have that happen."
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.580]   And he's like, "Yeah, that's exactly what I'll do.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.660]   Now I feel better."
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.500]   - Yeah.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.840]   - That night, that night,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.700]   the King had trouble sleeping.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.300]   So he ordered an attendant to bring the book
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.920]   of the history of his reign so it could be read to him.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.060]   So at this time, anytime the King did anything,
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.900]   it's a little bit like this.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.060]   You know, anytime kind of before Corona,
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.700]   Trump would do anything, it was like news.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.760]   Like, hey, Trump would travel someplace and it becomes news.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.420]   'Cause if you're the most powerful person,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.980]   whatever you say, whatever you do becomes news immediately.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.060]   In that context, whatever the King did would be recorded
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.980]   'cause it's making history, the King of the land.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.140]   So the King, you know, goes to a different state.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.660]   It's written in a history book.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.020]   Everything that he did was written in history book.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.260]   He has a time where he can't sleep at night
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.100]   and he's like struggling, he's laying there in bed.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.300]   And so he asks his attendants to come and read
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.460]   from the books of the account of his life,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.100]   which I'm guessing, I don't know if he was like,
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.900]   "Man, that's one of the more boring things
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.820]   you could read from.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.440]   Hopefully that'll put me to sleep,"
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.740]   or what exactly he's thinking.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.740]   But he asked them to come read from the account of his life
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.420]   and they take that book and here's what happens.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.380]   Here's what they read.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.580]   In the records, he discovered an account
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.260]   of how Mordecai, who worked at the King's gate,
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.500]   that's Uncle Jesse,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.940]   and the guy that Haman wants to kill,
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.940]   how Mordecai had exposed the plot of Bithynna and Teresh,
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.180]   two eunuchs who guarded the door
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.540]   to the King's private quarters
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.180]   and had plotted to assassinate King Xerxes.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.340]   So he basically realizes that something we didn't dive deep
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.180]   in in chapter two was a moment where these two eunuchs,
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.740]   the King's eunuchs, wanted to kill the King.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.260]   I think it makes sense why they'd want to kill the King.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.660]   He made them eunuchs.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.780]   You know what a eunuch is?
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.020]   And Mordecai heard about it and he went and exposed it
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.540]   and he said, "These guys are gonna kill you."
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.680]   And the King never heard about it.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.360]   So he says in verse three,
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.780]   "Hey, what recognition or reward did we ever give Mordecai
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.820]   for saving the King?"
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.140]   And his attendants replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.560]   Then the King heard, or in verse four,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.020]   "Who's in that outer court?" the King inquired.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.740]   As it happened, Haman had just arrived
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.540]   in the outer court of the palace
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.140]   to ask the King to impale or kill Mordecai
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.700]   on the pole he had prepared.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.420]   So the attendants replied, "It's Haman, he's out there."
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.740]   And so the King said, "Bring him in here."
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.860]   And he asks Haman,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.180]   "What do I do to honor a man who truly pleases me?"
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.300]   I wish we had more time to just like go so deep
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.860]   'cause there's so much irony and just, it's an amazing story.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.700]   "Hey, what do I do?"
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.900]   So you fall on the story.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.380]   - Yeah, so- - Basically the King,
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.420]   recap. - Yeah.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.340]   So he's, Haman wants to kill Mordecai
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.620]   'cause he won't bow to him.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.460]   And so he's getting all that planned ready to go kill him.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.020]   And meanwhile, over here, for whatever reason,
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.420]   King Xerxes cannot sleep,
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.300]   read to me the story in which is chapter two.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   And that story tells him, "Mordecai saved your life."
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.940]   And so he's like, "You know what?
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.500]   Maybe that'll help me fall asleep.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.580]   I'll give back to Mordecai for saving my life."
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.540]   And now we're seeing, he's looking around like,
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.140]   "Hey, who can help me give back to Mordecai?"
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.020]   And ironically, at that time,
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.820]   walking up to kill Mordecai is Haman.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.020]   And now-
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.860]   - That's exactly it.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.700]   So he's going, "Haman, hey, what should I do?"
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.260]   Verse seven.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.460]   - It's like a movie.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.300]   - Oh, totally.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.260]   Haman, I'm sorry, verse six,
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.260]   thought to himself,
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.100]   "Whom would the king be wanting to honor more than me?"
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.500]   So he thinks the king is kind of like in a roundabout way
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.340]   saying, "Hey, you know, if I was gonna get somebody
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.020]   for their birthday, you know, something,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.140]   what do you think's a good idea?"
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.380]   And you're like, "Oh, I know exactly what you're gonna get."
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.740]   Or I remember playing this game
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.180]   when I was getting engaged to my wife
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   and you're trying to figure out like
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.540]   what type of ring that they want.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.460]   And you're like, "Who do you think like
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.780]   is the best types of diamonds out there?"
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.140]   And you're just trying to like dance around it.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.540]   That's what Haman thinks is going on.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.140]   He doesn't realize he really wants to honor somebody else.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.300]   So Haman responds like, "Well, this is what I would want."
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.140]   So here's what he says.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.980]   "Hey, if the king wishes to honor someone,
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.780]   he should bring out one of the king's own royal robes."
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.780]   It's kind of weird to us
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.780]   that something the king has worn before,
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.340]   but it declared like a special privilege.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.700]   "As well as a horse the king has ridden on,
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.260]   one with the royal emblem on his head,
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.300]   let the robes and the horse be handed over
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.500]   to one of the king's most noble officials.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.340]   Let him see that that man whom the king wishes to honor
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.180]   is dressed in the king's robes.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.780]   He's led through the city square on the king's horse
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.660]   and have that person shout as they lead the person
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.660]   that the king wants to honor around the city.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.580]   This is what the king does for someone
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.220]   that they wish to honor."
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.540]   Verse 10, "Excellent," said the king to Haman.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.300]   "Quick, take the robes and my horse
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.620]   and do everything you've said for Mordecai the Jew,
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.740]   who sits at the gate of the palace.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.580]   Leave out nothing you've suggested."
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.420]   Like the irony.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.260]   - I just pictured that.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.940]   It's like he's like puffed up and then the king says that
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.460]   and it's like that jaw, you know, like,
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.300]   (imitates jaw dropping)
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.140]   - Yes.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.960]   - He's like, "What?"
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.800]   - Totally.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.180]   - The king's like, "Chop, chop," and he leaves.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.020]   - Make it happen.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.140]   - And people start moving and-
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:33.980]   - That's a great idea.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.340]   That's exactly what we should do.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.180]   And he's there to ask about killing Mordecai
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.980]   and now the king is going,
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.100]   "No, I want you to honor him and celebrate him
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.380]   and lead him around and say to the whole city,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.560]   this is what you can expect
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.740]   if you really are someone the king delights in."
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.780]   - Did Haman have to shout?
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.180]   - Yeah, he had to go around and shout.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.160]   The guy that he wanted to bow to him,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.240]   he now has to go around town and say,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.580]   "Hey, this is the guy that everybody should be focused on.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.700]   This is a guy that the king wants to honor.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.700]   Everybody should bow down.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.960]   This is the," it's basically, again, Disney movies, man.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.980]   You know that scene in "Aladdin" where Aladdin comes
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.380]   and the genie's with him and he's like,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.820]   his first wish is he wants to be a prince
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.340]   and the genie just basically shows up.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.460]   It's like one of the best parts of the movie
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.300]   where it's like,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.660]   â™ª Prince Ali, fabulous Ali-a-bob â™ª
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.500]   â™ª Well, he's got â™ª
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.340]   (imitates singing)
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.160]   - Yep, got it.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.780]   - That's essentially what, thank you for that,
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.220]   what Haman has to do with Mordecai
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.180]   is taking him around going,
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.500]   "Hey, everybody look at this guy.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.860]   Everyone look at this man."
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.960]   And you know he's got to be infuriated on the inside.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.780]   But inside of this story,
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.340]   there's three things that I really want to pull out
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.420]   because we see connections to what I would call
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.320]   this fairy tale faith here.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.360]   So we're going to pause.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.380]   We're going to pick it up next week
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.780]   on exactly what happens later in the story.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.220]   - I think it's tough, David,
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.660]   'cause like I'm reading this
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.300]   and as much as I want to laugh at Haman, I'm Haman.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.060]   And I don't know if that's where you're going with this,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.180]   but like, I think there's something in me.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.660]   Maybe I don't want to like walk around
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.020]   and have people parade, but I do.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.380]   I think all of us want to leave
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.100]   and walk on this earth where people know our names
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.140]   and people are giving us recognition.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.100]   And there's just something in us that it's like,
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.020]   man, why do I want to see people fail?
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.860]   - Totally.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.220]   - Like, why does that bring me joy?
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.540]   Why don't I naturally want to see people succeed?
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.380]   - Totally.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.220]   - And like, I read this story and I want to say that I'm,
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.020]   I want to strive to be the Mordecai,
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.060]   but there's definitely places in my heart
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.780]   that are wicked and are more like Haman.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.140]   - I think it's in all of us.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.020]   I think the connections that like fairy tale faith,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.420]   the parts of us like Haman embrace those ideas.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.260]   So when I say fairy tale faith,
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.500]   I think we see in Haman's life,
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.540]   something that is, can be patterns in all of our lives.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.620]   And the first one of just like,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.740]   hey, what is fairy tale faith?
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.660]   Or what does I mean by that?
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.180]   Fairy tale faith believes,
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.540]   one of the things it believes
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.340]   is what I would call like an if only faith.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.580]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.500]   In chapter five, he says, I've got wealth.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.260]   I got everything everybody wants.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.340]   In that culture, he had 10 sons, he says.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.140]   In that culture, having 10 sons was like, dude, you made it.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.340]   Because you got people that pass off your inheritance to,
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.780]   he says, I have great riches.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.220]   I'm the most powerful person next to the king.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.060]   I'm married.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.020]   I got the house.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.060]   I got money.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.540]   Upon money, I've got all of it.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.340]   - But if only Mordecai.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.060]   - But if only I had this, then I would be happy.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.900]   - Yep.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.820]   - And fairy tale faith believes that,
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.180]   hey, if only I had something else,
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.820]   maybe it's a future season of life.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.980]   Maybe it's a marriage.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.260]   Maybe it's a raise and a job.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.060]   Maybe it's some more stability
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.300]   in your current circumstances.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.620]   Then I would be happy.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.380]   - I know for me, it's like,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.660]   I think a lot of times we use time as an excuse
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.540]   for why we don't press into our faith
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.060]   and go deeper in our knowledge of the word
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.020]   or memorize scripture.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.420]   It's like, oh, well, if only I had more time,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.220]   I could be deep in my faith like that guy.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.060]   That guy's in ministry.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.940]   So like he has more time, it's his job.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.900]   And it's like now even in quarantine,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.380]   we have been given that if only,
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.980]   we've been given more time.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.820]   - Yeah.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.660]   - And we're still not, we're still wasting it
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.260]   and being negligent with our time.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.620]   And so that if only cycle just-
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.460]   - Totally.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.300]   - It doesn't work.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.140]   - And there's some of this,
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.980]   there's part of all of our hearts that can be like,
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.420]   man, if only I had this,
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   if only I was married, then I would be satisfied.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.660]   The Bible says that when you get married,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.300]   1 Corinthians 7, it says, when you get married,
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.740]   it's not gonna bring satisfaction,
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.100]   it's gonna bring trouble.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.660]   Now let me be clear, marriage is awesome.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.940]   It is a gift from God,
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.220]   but it doesn't satisfy that part of you.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.860]   And so if you can't be satisfied right now and single,
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.340]   you're gonna be unable to be satisfied
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.260]   and married at some point.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.140]   Maybe for you, it's like, man,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.860]   I just wish I had children or I wish I had wealth.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.300]   The Bible says in Ecclesiastes chapter five, verse 10,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.660]   whoever loves money never has enough.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.260]   Whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.660]   Basically the richest guy,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.620]   which is who Solomon who wrote that says,
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.620]   man, if you think more money will satisfy your problems,
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.700]   you're a fool.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.540]   I remember somebody asked me this question one time,
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.340]   they were like, we were talking about ministry
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.180]   and ministry can be challenging
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.460]   because while we're all blessed in America,
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.820]   but you can buy the lie that,
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.900]   man, I just wish that I made more money
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.860]   or I wish I had more income.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.060]   And I remember the guy sitting down and he said,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.500]   let me ask you a question.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.860]   How much would be enough money?
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.260]   So you think about this question.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.940]   For the rest of your life, if I made this,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.180]   I would never again be like,
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.660]   man, I wish that I made more.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.780]   I wish I could still get raised.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.780]   Like if you got this tomorrow,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.740]   it's your salary for the rest of your life,
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.780]   how much would be enough?
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.620]   I don't know how well you would think.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.460]   I mean, you put down there, what would you put?
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.300]   How much would be enough?
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.940]   - I've always said like 80K.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.780]   - 80K.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.620]   - 80 to 100K.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.460]   - Yeah.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.300]   - Be enough, I'll be settled.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.460]   - I love it, dude.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.300]   I remember when I asked that question.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.500]   - Probably not going to happen, but.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.060]   - No, I asked that or I answered that question.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.380]   And I think I said like, I mean, looking back,
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.780]   it was like such a lofty, if I had this,
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.980]   I think for college and preparing for kids,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.540]   I think it was like a few hundred thousand dollars
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.380]   or something a year.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.420]   - Okay, I don't feel so bad.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.660]   - And the guy, I know, maybe I should feel bad.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.340]   And the guy looked at me and he said what's so true.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.100]   He was like, no, it won't.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.580]   No amount ever will be.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.700]   People who make 300,000 or 500,000 or a million dollars,
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.820]   it's never enough.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.740]   And the Bible says, if you live in this life,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.340]   that's like, if only, it will never be enough.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.100]   There is a way to experience satisfaction,
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.300]   but it doesn't come from how much you make
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.700]   or being married or having children or whatever,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.300]   that if only, if you begin to ask that,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.540]   and if only doesn't involve,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.140]   if only I knew Jesus or I knew God more,
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.420]   I was deeper in my relationship with him.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.020]   If that's not where you're filling in the blank,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.380]   there is a part of you that has embraced
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.100]   a fairy tale experience of faith.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.780]   I remember coming across an illustration,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.580]   or I'm sorry, a conversation with Brad Pitt
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.020]   that modeled this so well.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.860]   - You had one?
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.300]   - No, no, no, it would be kind of fun,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.020]   but it was with Rolling Stone, the magazine, and Brad Pitt.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.860]   - Gotcha.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.140]   - And it further illustrated like, dude,
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.620]   everybody that you think would be so,
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.420]   if only I had that type of life, that'd be amazing.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.900]   And in the conversation, he said this,
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.100]   let me just read it to you.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.980]   Brad, speaking of Rolling Stone, says,
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.220]   "I know these things are all supposed to be
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.660]   "important to us, the car, the condo,
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.300]   "our version of success, but if that's the case,
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.780]   "why is there this general feeling out there
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.700]   "reflecting more impotence and isolation
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.540]   "and desperation and loneliness?
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.860]   "If you ask me," as it relates to the car, the condo,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.380]   the version of success, "I say we toss all of this out.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.940]   "We've got to find something else,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.460]   "because all I know is at this point in time,
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.500]   "we're headed for a dead end and numbing of the soul,
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.860]   "a complete atrophy of the spiritual being."
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.340]   So if we're heading, Rolling Stones,
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.380]   towards this kind of dead end society,
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.180]   what do you think should happen?
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.420]   "Man, I don't have the answers," Brad says, "to that yet.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   "The emphasis right now is on success and personal gain,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.580]   "and I'm telling you, I'm sitting in it, and that's not it.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.740]   "I'm the guy who has everything, and I'm telling you,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.460]   "once you've got everything, you're just left with yourself.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.420]   "I've said it before, and I'll say it again,
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.900]   "it doesn't help you sleep any better at night,
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.340]   "and you don't wake up any better because of it."
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.780]   Brad essentially reflects the fact that
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.340]   even the guy who has everything you would want,
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.700]   the looks, the car, the wife, the scenario,
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.220]   it doesn't satisfy.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.620]   There is a way to experience satisfaction biblically,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.820]   but you will never be happy if your happiness
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.780]   is based on what is happening around you,
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.940]   because that's always gonna change.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.380]   In Bible, the scripture says in Philippians chapter four,
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.340]   there is a way to experience contentment.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.620]   Paul specifically says, you can go read it later,
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.780]   where he says, "Look, I've experienced,
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.980]   "and I've discovered the secret to being satisfied.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.740]   "No matter what is going on, what's happening around me,
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.820]   "I can be happy because my happiness
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.940]   "is not based on what is happening.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.100]   "It comes from Jesus and knowing him.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.260]   "So I can be starving or I can be full."
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.700]   He literally says that in the passage.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.900]   There's an old guy who said, his name is Augustine,
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.500]   he was basically a guy who worked in ministry
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.380]   years and years and years ago.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.180]   He said, "We were made for you, God,
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.260]   "and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.660]   So the first idea of fairy tale faith,
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.060]   if part of you believes like Haman,
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.620]   if only then you have embraced a fairy tale version
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.060]   at some level of faith.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.700]   The second idea just from Haman's life,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.220]   I wanna talk a little bit about.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.060]   - Can I just, really quick?
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:08.900]   - Yeah.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.900]   - You just remind me of Matthew 6,
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.460]   where Jesus is given the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.620]   and he says, "Do not lay up for yourselves
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.380]   "treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.820]   "and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.440]   "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.140]   "where neither moth nor rust destroys,
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.760]   "and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.980]   "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.700]   And I think that's a great answer
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.800]   to the problem of the if-only life.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.840]   It's like, man, if you are looking for fulfillment
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.420]   in the treasures of this earth, they're gonna be fleeting.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.720]   But if you start to store up treasures
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.200]   and eternal things and heavenly things,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.600]   and things are gonna last forever,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.720]   you're gonna find that satisfaction you're talking about.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.120]   - Totally, and takes constant reminding of that.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.940]   Like, I'm gonna walk out of here tonight,
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.040]   and I'm gonna be tempted to think, "If only."
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.840]   - And there's just part of us that always,
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.880]   that needs to confess that
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   and bring that to other believers and drag it.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.640]   The second thing, just that's so clear in the story
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.200]   that I think is a part of what I would say, again,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.480]   is fairytale faith,
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.160]   is a belief that is really common among our generation.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.080]   That, "Hey, if I do good, I get good.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.280]   "Anytime I do good, I'm gonna get a reward."
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's like a Christian version of karma
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.080]   that, "Hey, if I'm faithful,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.580]   "I'm gonna do what God says to do,
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.740]   "and I'm gonna get the promotion.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.760]   "I'm gonna get the raise.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.300]   "The relationship's gonna work out.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.540]   "I'm gonna pursue purity, and I'm gonna end up married,
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.220]   "and everything's gonna go the way that I want it to."
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.980]   Biblically, that's just not true.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.740]   And I wish that it was.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.300]   Hey, or I'm sorry, Mordecai,
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.900]   the reason I say that's in the story
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.860]   is you look at Mordecai's life.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.060]   He saves the king, and nothing happens.
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.700]   Like he saves the king from being killed,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.980]   and nothing immediately happens.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.180]   In fact, five years go by without anybody saying anything.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.300]   He doesn't get any credit.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.420]   He doesn't get the reward.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.720]   King didn't even know about it.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.500]   In fact, in the book, you know what the next verse,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.700]   so in chapter two, when he saves the king,
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.220]   exposes the plot, the very next verse
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.820]   after that happens is chapter three, verse one.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.660]   Sometime later, Xerxes promoted, you would think, Mordecai,
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.860]   Haman over all the other nobles, wicked Haman,
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.020]   making him the most powerful official in the empire.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.820]   Sometimes you do the right thing,
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.460]   and you don't get an immediate reward.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.700]   Sometimes you don't ever get a reward, this side of heaven.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.260]   But eventually, and ultimately, it works out,
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.460]   and that God will eternally repay with good
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.460]   those who do good, just like you mentioned
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.300]   in Matthew chapter six.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.540]   But in this life, the Bible even says,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.260]   sometimes you do good things, and you lose your job.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.400]   Sometimes you're like, I'm not going to the strip club, boss,
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.540]   and you get fired.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.060]   Sometimes you talk about your faith
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.640]   to your students in your classroom, and you lose your job.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.540]   Sometimes your relationship, like you break up,
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.860]   'cause you're like, I wanna follow God,
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.600]   and I feel like this is not healthy,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.960]   and I wanna get healthy, and you remain single.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.300]   Or like, I know a lot of cases where you start,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.220]   someone in the relationship starts to follow Christ,
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.540]   and maybe they're living with their significant other,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.940]   and they come back home, and they say,
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.660]   hey, either you jump on with me,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.940]   we move out of this house, and we start to follow Christ,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.780]   or I'm out.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.820]   And some of these people have been dating for years,
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.540]   and they say goodbye.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.420]   - And it's done, and that happens.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.500]   And the church does a disservice
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.680]   when they communicate things in the positivity gospel
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.020]   or prosperity gospel, that's like,
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.180]   man, if you do good, I even see with Corona pastors,
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.220]   tragically, I think, putting stuff out there that's like,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.500]   hey, and let me tell you, no weapon formed against you,
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.360]   this Corona will not attack you,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.340]   you will not be sickened by this disease,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.680]   and you will rise, and a shelter of protection
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.580]   will be placed on you.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.880]   And that's not necessarily true,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.540]   that God hasn't promised that.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.000]   And there's example after example.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.020]   In Ecclesiastes chapter eight,
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.460]   it really says something that I think is just such a
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.220]   not commonly talked about verse.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.260]   It says this, hey, because a crime is not punished quickly
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.780]   when somebody does wrong,
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.020]   people feel like it's okay to do wrong,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.720]   or it's safe to do wrong.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.300]   But even though a person sins a hundred times
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.860]   and still lives a long time, like they do wicked,
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.620]   they get away with it, they live a long life.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.260]   I know Solomon says, it's better off
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.500]   for those who fear God.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.900]   Verse 14, in this life, this is in the Bible, people,
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.300]   in this life, listen to this verse,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.780]   good people are often treated as though they were wicked,
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.620]   and wicked people are often treated as though they were good.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.620]   Solomon addresses the Bible is so honest,
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.840]   'cause it says, have you ever wondered
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.340]   why sometimes bad things happen to good people?
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.060]   And like really good things happen to really bad people?
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.420]   Like, why does that happen?
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   And the Bible acknowledges,
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.760]   it's a part of this broken world around us.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.500]   Karma is not how God operates.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.980]   And every time that you do the right thing,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.080]   it is ultimately worth it and eternally worth it,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.380]   but it doesn't mean that you're gonna get the promotion,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.220]   you're gonna get the raise,
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.780]   everything is always gonna work in your favor.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.000]   Galatians chapter six says,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.500]   those who sow to the spirit will reap eternal life,
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.360]   but let us not grow weary in doing good.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.580]   So let us not grow weary,
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.620]   for at the proper time we will reap a harvest
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.460]   if we do not get up.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.580]   In other words, don't stop doing good,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.060]   even when you don't see it being repaid immediately
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.240]   and rewarded.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.280]   God may not come back five years later
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.100]   and do what the king did for Mordecai,
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.700]   but in eternity,
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.500]   he sees every act of faithfulness and obedience,
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.560]   and he sees your actions,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.060]   he sees it and he hasn't forgotten you,
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.380]   and it will be worth it.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.860]   Eternally, the reward will be yours,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.420]   but in this life, it's not promised.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.860]   And I hope everything goes awesome
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.220]   and nobody listening gets sick and all of that,
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.440]   but God has promised,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.140]   we live in a broken world and things don't always go good.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.960]   And it is like a baby believer that thinks,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.880]   man, if I give $10,
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.140]   God's gonna give it all back
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.160]   and not necessarily in this life.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.860]   - I know one time,
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.540]   or after my dad died of cancer,
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.900]   there was a season where obviously I'm questioning why,
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.500]   I'm trying to figure out why, why.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.920]   And someone told me,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.020]   either it could be one of two things,
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.340]   either someone had sin in their life
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.340]   or my dad had sin in his life,
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.800]   and that was why,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.980]   or two, did you have enough faith?
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.300]   And you all must not have truly believed
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.580]   that God could heal him
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.000]   or that you needed more faith, more faith.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.380]   And that, I mean,
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.180]   luckily I had the right people around me,
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:33.120]   but I feel for the people who hear that lie
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.380]   because that's just, that is a lie.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.340]   - It is totally a lie.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.500]   I mean, it almost takes more faith or as much
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.940]   to see God not take the cancer away
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.660]   and still say, I trust him.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.660]   He's still good.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.340]   It takes enormous faith.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.820]   Just as much faith as a person who says,
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.540]   wow, I saw the miracle happen.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.900]   It's just as incredible when someone says,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.380]   I didn't see it happen, but God is still good.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.020]   His word's true and I trust him.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.800]   And he hasn't promised it's always gonna be easy.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.660]   There's a chapter and we can move on to the third example,
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.940]   but just quickly,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.580]   you know what the hall of faith chapter is?
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   - Yeah.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.140]   I don't, I mean, I'm not trying to flex, but yeah.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.980]   - Yeah, you do.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.820]   - Hebrew's 11.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.300]   - Oh, there we go.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.740]   He just put it out there, reading his Bible.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.300]   Okay, so Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.620]   It's such a cool chapter.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.540]   - It is, just whole Testament.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.380]   - Oh, it's awesome.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.420]   Okay, it's called the hall of faith.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.820]   So it lays out like just one dude after the next,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.140]   after the next, to a guy and girl who walked by faith
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.560]   and over and over it says, by faith, Abraham did X.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.860]   By faith, Sarah did X.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.700]   By faith, Isaac.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.120]   By faith, Abel.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.100]   And it goes through all these different things
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.940]   that people did.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.900]   And at the end of the chapter, dude,
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.220]   this ministers to me so much.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.140]   At the end of the chapter, the author,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.500]   it's like, he's like,
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.460]   "Whew, I'm getting going and I wish I had more time."
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.380]   'Cause he literally says, "Time would fail me."
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.620]   What more should I say?
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.620]   For time would fail me if I was to talk about,
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.940]   and then he lists off Gideon, Barak,
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.220]   saying all these different guys who by faith
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.280]   did these incredible things.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.740]   And then here's what he says.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.620]   Who by faith, they conquered kingdoms.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.020]   They administered justice.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.620]   They gained what was promised.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.800]   They shut the mouths of lions by faith.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.720]   They quenched the fury of the flames.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.420]   They escaped the edge of the sword
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.440]   whose weakness was turned to strength.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.900]   They became powerful in battle
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.840]   and they put foreign armies to flight.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.120]   Women received back their dead, raised to life again.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:20.960]   All these incredible things.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.520]   Like by faith, they did this.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.680]   And then halfway through the paragraph,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.220]   kind of gives me chills.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.400]   He takes a turn and it goes from
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.080]   all these amazing things that were done
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.800]   to they also did and faced incredibly
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.140]   horrific, painful things.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.160]   It didn't always end with the lion's mouth shutting.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.040]   They were tortured or there were others
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.880]   who were tortured by faith,
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.520]   refusing to be released so that they might gain
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.340]   a better resurrection.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.880]   Some faced jeers and flogging.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.400]   They were insulted for their faith,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.360]   even chains and imprisonment.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.680]   They were put to death by stoning.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.280]   They were sawed in two.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.040]   They were killed by the sword.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.960]   They went around in sheepskins and in goatskins,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.660]   destitute, persecuted and mistreated.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.640]   The world was not worthy of them.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   They wandered in deserts and in mountains,
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.480]   living in caves and holes in the ground.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.600]   They were commended for their faith.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.160]   Yet none of them received in their life
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.080]   what was promised.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.880]   The Bible says there are two ways that our faith
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.780]   lives itself out in our life.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.160]   One is in feasting and one is in famine
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.880]   and both require tremendous faith.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.720]   It requires faith to shut the mouth of lion
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   and it requires faith to say,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.240]   God is not shutting the mouth of the lion,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.680]   but I still trust you.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.860]   And both of those are involved when you walk by faith.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.700]   He doesn't always take the pain away,
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.300]   keep your job, promise that everything's gonna work out
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.060]   all the ways that we want it to for any of us.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.740]   But he promises and it involves, I'm walking by faith.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.360]   And in the Bible, that's the examples
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.700]   of old Testament men and women.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.860]   It's not always, everything went perfect.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.100]   And so this idea that, hey man, if I always do good,
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.540]   it's always gonna end up good.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.420]   Not always, but it's the best way to live
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.720]   and eventually and eternally, God says,
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.260]   you will see it was worth it to live
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.740]   according to what I called you to.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.340]   - Man, that's convicting.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.260]   It's convicting 'cause I do think that myself
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.780]   and a lot of people, especially people my age
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.180]   are looking for the first half of the chapter of faith.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.180]   We want the victory because that,
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.560]   it actually points at us and we disguise it of like,
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.860]   God, God, the glory, all that.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.060]   It's like, look at how good I'm doing.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.460]   Look at what I'm getting because of my faith.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.300]   Look at me, look at me.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.700]   And in faith and suffering only allows you to say,
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.840]   look at God, I need God, I'm dependent on God.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   And I think a lot of people try to quicken the process
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.500]   of being in the valleys and in the low moments of life,
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.900]   they try to get out of those and they wanna ride the highs.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.740]   - I know I do.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.540]   - Yeah, so natural.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.540]   And man, but when you truly access this kind of faith
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:09.280]   in the Lord in those seasons,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.660]   over time, every time they kind of get sweeter.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.660]   You start to see when you approach hard seasons,
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.580]   when you approach pandemics across the world,
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.540]   it's like, man, I know this is bringing a lot of hurt
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.560]   and grief and chaos to a lot of people,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.140]   but there's also something sweet going on
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.420]   with the clear, evident movement of God
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.300]   in the midst of this tragedy.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.340]   And I feel like the church is uniting.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.340]   I feel like people are looking and searching
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.580]   and it's a time to not try to quicken
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.420]   and hurry out of this season, but to go, man,
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.580]   how can we be great men and women,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.540]   brothers and sisters of faith in this time
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:47.940]   that the world can look at and say, man,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.460]   God is doing something in those people.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.020]   - By faith, even if it's not going how we want it to.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.660]   Absolutely, which leads perfectly into third idea.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.780]   I think fairytale faith involves not just thinking
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.180]   that if I do good, then I'm always gonna get good,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.100]   that I'm gonna get a reward immediately in that moment,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.780]   that it also involves thinking life is about me.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.140]   That fairytale faith involves thinking life is about you.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.580]   There's this lie and it's really common
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.220]   among our generation, just like Haman.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.580]   I mean, Haman walked in there and he was like,
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.460]   oh, the king's talking about somebody I wanna honor.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.220]   Of course, who else is he talking about than me?
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.500]   This dude was so thoughtful and so obsessed,
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.740]   like not just in the way that he thought that moment,
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.580]   but he also was bragging to all of his friends,
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.980]   look how great I am.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.260]   It was clear, a self-focus that his life was focused
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.380]   and revolved around him and a fairytale faith.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.540]   Commonly in our generation, there's like an epidemic
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.100]   where we are the selfie self-focused generation
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   and it is really messing us up.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.940]   Here's kind of what I mean by that.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.980]   Have you done the Disney?
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   You're gonna love this.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.620]   Have you done the Disney app that,
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.940]   it's not a Disney app, it's on Instagram.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.100]   There's like an effect where you can go on
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.900]   and you can decide which,
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.620]   we're just sticking with this whole Disney theme,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.740]   where I can go and I choose
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.020]   and it tells me which character I am.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.540]   And I'm going through. - Are you doing it?
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.980]   - Yeah, oh, I was Moana.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.460]   And I was, here I am, Moana, standing strong.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.300]   Isn't that guy Moana?
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.700]   He's the big guy in Moana.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.940]   - Is it Maui or something? - Oh yeah.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.780]   Have you seen it?
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.620]   - Moana?
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.100]   - No, have you seen, clearly you've seen this app.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:25.940]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.780]   I'm about to do it.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.380]   One second, please.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.060]   - Oh, here we go.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.580]   - I don't even know who this is.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.460]   - Let me see.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.820]   - From Cinderella, I think it's like the evil stepsister.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.900]   - I think you should do it again.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.740]   - Okay.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.580]   - If you don't know who it is,
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.260]   you should take that one out. - One more time.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.140]   All right.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.860]   Cinderella?
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.700]   - Oh yeah, that is Cinderella.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.620]   - I mean, I'm not trying to be Cinderella.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.060]   - Dude, you got back-to-back Cinderella stories, okay?
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   - Anyways, so.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.500]   You know, it's really common.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.420]   It's like, it kind of went viral,
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.260]   I feel like a few months ago.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys should try that out
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.020]   if you haven't.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.500]   - Yeah, you can-- - Tag the porch or something.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.780]   - Yeah, tag us at the porch.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.820]   You can show us yours on there.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:04.700]   We'll post ours.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.740]   But here's the same experience that everybody has on there.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.700]   When I, at least I feel like I do,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.220]   I'm like, "Oh, dude, I don't want to be
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.100]   "the stepsister in Cinderella.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.220]   "I want to be Hercules."
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.060]   - Why is it even on there?
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.100]   - "I want to be Simba.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.180]   "I want to be like, no one wants to be Pumbaa or--"
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.020]   - I mean, come on.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.220]   I mean, Pumbaa's pretty likable, I will give you that.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.260]   But especially girls are not like,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.660]   "Oh, great, I'm the warthog."
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.500]   - I'm Pumbaa.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.340]   - I'm Pumbaa.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.260]   - I'm the warthog.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.860]   - And we all want to be like the star,
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.620]   the hero, the princess, the pretty girl.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.900]   We don't want to be the stepsister over there.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   And I think that, you know, that's fine with an app,
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.540]   but that's really how a lot of us think about our life.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.020]   We're like, "Man, I'm the star.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.060]   "I want to be the star.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   "I want to be the focus.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.500]   "I want to be seen as the princess.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.060]   "I want to be someone who they put their attention on me."
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.980]   And our life becomes so self-focused.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.660]   And this generation, truly,
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.940]   I think one of the reasons such depression rates
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.020]   or depression levels are so high amongst our generation
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.580]   is because we're so self-focused
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.580]   on how what everyone thinks about me,
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.140]   how nobody's as nice as they should be to me,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.540]   how I bet, you know, they're talking bad about me,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.740]   or no one, you know,
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.820]   they should think more importantly of me,
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.300]   or no one's texting me on my birthday as much as they should.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.460]   And we're so self-focused.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.460]   And there is like a trap and a prison
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.620]   that comes through that,
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.380]   because you're believing the lie
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.340]   that this life is about you.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.900]   And the truth from the scripture
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.620]   is that this life is not about you.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.020]   You're not the hero.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.860]   You're not the star.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.700]   Neither am I.
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.580]   We're not the princess.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.900]   There is one hero, and his name is Jesus.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.300]   And the more that I live life going like,
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.580]   "Look at me, look at me, look at me,"
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.820]   the less able I'm able to go,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.020]   "Hey, look at Jesus, look at Jesus, look at Jesus."
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.940]   And as Christians, truth-faith should mark our lives.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.780]   And as you've heard us probably say before,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.700]   if you've tuned in,
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.380]   the posture of a Christian should not be,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.580]   "Man, I wanna be famous.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.700]   I wanna have a bunch of followers for me."
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.980]   I want to spread the gospel, live for Jesus,
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.380]   die and be forgotten.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.100]   And when I'm healthy,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.780]   that is really the posture of my heart.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.620]   And when I'm not, I'm concerned about
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.380]   how other people don't do enough for me,
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.540]   and nobody cares enough about me,
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.200]   and how great I am, and just so self-focused on me.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.040]   That definition of humility,
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.500]   you know what I'm talking about?
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.780]   - Yeah, it's not thinking less of yourself,
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.020]   it's thinking of yourself less.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.660]   - Yeah, that you just spend less time
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.700]   thinking about yourself,
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.980]   that you don't go, "Oh, I suck at life."
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.740]   It's that you just don't spend a lot of time
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.980]   thinking about yourself.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.820]   Think about others.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.420]   - I think a character in the Bible
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.940]   that I look to in this example is John.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.260]   In John 1, I love the description of John.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.020]   It says, "He was not the light,
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.700]   but he just came to bear witness about the light."
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.420]   And I always say, coincidentally, my name is John David.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.740]   I'm like, I wanna be that.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.380]   He is not the light.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:50.460]   He came to bear witness.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.260]   He spent his life pointing everyone to the light.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.220]   - Yes.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.180]   I mean, John 3, verse 30,
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.300]   John the Baptist speaking to your exact point,
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.580]   says, "He must become greater, Jesus.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.940]   Put more focus on him, put less focus on me."
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.420]   And I think that's really challenging for a lot of us,
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.100]   that we want to be seen, we wanna be in the spotlight,
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.180]   or we want people to know us,
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.820]   and it's really unhealthy 'cause life is not about you.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.220]   Fairytale faith belief, life's about you.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.420]   The truth is, life is about Jesus.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.660]   Colossians 1 says, "He's before all things.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.900]   All things were made by him and for him and through him.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   He's the center and he holds everything together,
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.380]   and life is about him."
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.940]   And the more that I try to make it about me,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.100]   I lose, and it's depressing, and it's lonely.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.060]   And the more that I focus on him and others knowing him,
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.620]   and not how much credit that I get,
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.540]   the more I experience like a freedom in life
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.380]   in the midst of that.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.620]   It's like this, and I'm about to close or shut us down here.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.220]   My hometown, I grew up in Houston,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.980]   and where I grew up, they recorded a movie.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.460]   And you ever seen the movie "Tin Cup"?
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.900]   - I haven't, I'm sorry.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.560]   - I feel like nobody, this is like a '90s movie
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.140]   with, you know who Kevin Costner is?
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.380]   There he is. - Heard the name.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.980]   - Oh, Kevin Costner, like the, "If you build it,
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.820]   he will come."
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.860]   He was really famous back in the day.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.020]   - Gotcha.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.500]   - Anyways, that was recorded in my hometown.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.700]   So people that I grew up with got to go be extras in it,
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.660]   and my mom was actually in the movie.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.140]   So if you go watch it, you go see my mom in the movie,
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.620]   but here's where she was in the movie.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.760]   It's like a golf movie, so golf courses.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.660]   And there's like one quick scene in the movie.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.540]   - She's over like.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.880]   (laughing)
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.940]   No, it's not even that.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.140]   It's one quick scene in the movie
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.020]   where like the back of her head is there.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.220]   Like it kind of like quickly pans,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.060]   you're like, "Oh, I think that's her right there."
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   And if I was to, or if she was to, and she wouldn't,
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.140]   she's like the sweetest, greatest person ever.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.020]   But if she was to be like, "Hey guys,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.500]   "I just want to make sure everyone knows
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.000]   "I'm starring in this movie, me and Kevin Costner.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.300]   "Go see my film, you're really gonna love it."
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.220]   People would go and they would be buying a false perception.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.020]   Really, she would just be believing a false perception.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.860]   That is not a movie starring you and Kevin Costner.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.120]   You're not the star of that movie.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.500]   You're a blip on the second of the screen.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.820]   You can't even really tell it's you.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.520]   It's clearly not about you.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.620]   In the same way, that is what our life,
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.260]   the scriptures say, is.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.540]   It's like a blip on the screen.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.460]   It's not about, you're not the starring role.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.900]   You're not the main person in the story.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.180]   Jesus is the main person.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.440]   So if you buy the lie, you're as delusional as my mom saying,
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.120]   "Oh, look at this movie, it's me and Kevin.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   "It was a really big deal.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.100]   "I'm a really big deal."
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.660]   You're as delusional as she is
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.700]   'cause you're even a quicker blip
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.140]   in the scheme of eternity that it is about Jesus.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.300]   And if you live your life and you focus your life
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.540]   and your time and your energy on you and what you need
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.220]   and what you want in life at the expense
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.780]   of knowing Jesus and helping others to know him
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.860]   and using this, even Corona now, to serve other people,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.140]   you're wasting your life.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:46.980]   - That's good.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.260]   - And that blip on the screen.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.780]   The last thing, just as we kind of conclude
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.580]   that jumped out of the text was at the very in there,
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.380]   or I'm sorry, at the very beginning,
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.320]   it says on the third day of the fast.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.220]   And I just wanna recognize
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.100]   there's such a parallel to Jesus here.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.420]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.020]   It says on the third day, she went in,
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.540]   she fasted three days.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.960]   And on the third day, in the place of death,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.660]   she put her life out there.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.900]   And by doing so, she ends up saving her people.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.420]   She saved the people of God.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.300]   And the third day where death could have been present
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.500]   or death was there, she lays her life down.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.380]   And in its place, life rises to save the people.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.020]   Biblically, the third day is over and over,
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.200]   just such a foreshadowing of Jesus who would die.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.820]   And on the third day where he would lay down his life,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.120]   life would be given and it would save his people.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.960]   That's us.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.500]   That's anyone who's ever trusted in Jesus.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.540]   And tonight there's people listening as there were last week
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.220]   who's never had a moment where you trusted in Christ,
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.140]   where you put your faith in Jesus,
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.220]   the God who came into this earth
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.900]   and he gave his life on a cross for you.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   Not because of anything that you did to deserve it,
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.580]   but because he loved you so much
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.100]   despite all the different ways
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.700]   that you didn't deserve his love.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.140]   He gave his life on the cross.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.420]   He died and he was buried.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.100]   And then he defeated death by coming back alive.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.660]   As though the payment for all sin everywhere,
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.300]   every sin you've ever done, it cleared.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.120]   It was more than enough and it broke through.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.780]   And now the invitation has been given
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.100]   to anyone who will trust,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.460]   not in how good of a person you are,
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.200]   listen to me very closely,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.460]   or how bad of a person you are,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.140]   that's why you couldn't have a relationship with God.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.700]   All those put you at the center.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.460]   The gospel is Jesus at the center.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.760]   And anyone who trusts in what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.260]   despite the fact that I don't deserve
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.660]   to have a relationship with God,
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.820]   paying for my sin and rose from the dead,
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.180]   they will have eternal life.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.860]   And God, make no mistake, has had you here
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.380]   listening to this message, even this moment right now,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.580]   because he's extending to you that invitation.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.740]   If you will just say, I believe that.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.100]   I trust not in what I do, but in what Jesus did.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.820]   You'll have eternal life.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.020]   And that gift and that ultimate expression
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.180]   that foreshadowed all throughout the book of Esther
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.780]   of Jesus and his third day,
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.960]   laying down his life to give you and I
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.940]   in the place of death, life.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.820]   You'll experience that.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.780]   God doesn't say good people go to heaven,
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.220]   bad people go to hell.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.340]   It says, forgiven people go to heaven.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.100]   And there's only one way to get forgiveness.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.780]   And that is by putting your trust in Jesus.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.300]   And it is no mistake, it's not a coincidence,
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.140]   'cause people are gonna think,
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.540]   oh, it just got shared and just popped on here.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.580]   It's not a coincidence.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.500]   Just like every moment in the story,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.420]   there's not a coincidence.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.020]   Like that night, the king reads that book
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.860]   and it ends up with that one story
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.580]   and that saves Mordecai's life.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.420]   I mean, think about that.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.180]   Like it was all like the point you see is like,
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.780]   wow, clearly, what are the odds
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.500]   that he wouldn't sleep that one night,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.100]   the night before Mordecai was supposed to die.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.660]   And then he's like, hey, read me a book.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.860]   And the guy picks that one book, there's thousands of books.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.060]   And then he opens to that one chapter
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.900]   about Mordecai's saving.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.200]   He's like, well, it's no coincidence.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.580]   God was moving it around.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.620]   And it's no coincidence, you're listening right now.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.620]   God who's there hasn't forgotten you.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.580]   He loves you.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.020]   And he proved it by giving his life for you.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:13.860]   So good.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.680]   And I just want you to know
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.340]   that invitation has been extended.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.300]   He wants you to know him and have a relationship
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.020]   more than you have any idea.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.760]   And if you, by faith tonight, receive Jesus as your savior,
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.900]   as your Lord, the payment for your sin,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.980]   you are eternally in relationship with God.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.580]   So man, that's all I got.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.860]   I'm gonna pray for us unless you got something else.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.580]   - No, I think we pray and then I'll wrap us up.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.420]   - Come on.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.660]   Well, Father, thank you that you are a God
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.460]   that doesn't have coincidences.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.800]   You are a God of control and power and sovereignty.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.640]   You're over all of it.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.980]   And I do pray for anyone listening right now
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.400]   who's never received that free gift,
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.940]   that you don't want something from them.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.100]   You want them to know you did something for them
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.180]   on the cross.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.100]   That tonight would be the night they receive by faith
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.460]   that free gift, or if they listen weeks later,
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.900]   they would receive that free gift by faith
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.220]   you gave us in giving us your life.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:12.100]   Thank you that you have conquered sin and death
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.900]   and you are going to totally remove the consequences
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.260]   of sin and sickness and disease and all the chaos
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.620]   in a world fully and finally in all of eternity.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.940]   But as we wait, would you help us?
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.740]   And I do pray for anyone who's suffering right now
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.920]   through job loss, which we know there are many,
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.780]   through people who are experiencing sickness or illness
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.340]   or loved ones who are, that you, the God of comfort
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.860]   would meet them right now where they are.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.740]   And the body of Christ would tangibly come around them
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.960]   and support and care.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.100]   Would you help us to be strong and to be your people
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:47.180]   and not have fairy tale faith, but true faith
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.420]   in the midst of everything we face.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.580]   We love you, in Christ's name, amen.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.740]   - Amen.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.940]   Man, thanks, David.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.660]   That really encouraged me, seriously.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.720]   And you guys just remember, like I said at the beginning,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.340]   we'll be going live on Instagram every day this week
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.460]   at noon with many friends.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.300]   - That's a guess.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.120]   - It's gonna be really fun.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.980]   And then, like I said, if we can pray for you,
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.900]   we wanna do that.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.500]   So go to theporsh.live/prayer
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.980]   and please invite us into that with you guys.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.500]   So until next week.
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.540]   - We'll see you next week.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.500]   - All right, see you guys. - Let's go.
