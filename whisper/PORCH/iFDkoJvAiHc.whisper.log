[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:26.240]   What's up, everybody?
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.280]   Joining us from wherever you are tuning in from,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.680]   we are continuing the series, Therapy,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.000]   where we are each week exploring a biblical perspective
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.700]   on mental health.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.360]   For the last few weeks, we have been diving into anxiety
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.000]   and what is a perspective that the Bible says
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   is helpful as it relates to anxiety.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.400]   Tonight, we're going to finish off really the last
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.080]   of the handful of weeks that we've
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080]   been diving into the topic of anxiety, which
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.800]   is such a big issue that we didn't
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.080]   think we could do it justice by doing it one night.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   Mental health was a problem in our society
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   well before COVID ever took place,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.120]   and corona has only escalated and made things worse.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.960]   So we are camping out and talking each week
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760]   on session one, session two, session three,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.000]   and going week by week what it looks like to walk
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   through therapy, getting healthy, covering anxiety,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.600]   covering depression, covering just general healing
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.880]   and recovering from our past.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520]   So tonight, we're finishing off just looking at anxiety.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.880]   And I'm going to start like this.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.040]   A couple of years ago, I got invited
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.480]   with a friend of mine who was in ministry, JP,
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.400]   if you're familiar, who now leads a church called
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.240]   Harris Creek in Waco.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.560]   But the two of us were invited to go to London
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.920]   to be a part of a conference for kind of next generation
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   pastors, 75 of us from all over the world.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.280]   And we were hanging out in London for the week.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   So we decided, hey, we're going to make this just
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.560]   like a brocation, plan it out, have a game plan for going
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.400]   to see all that London had to offer.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   Neither of us had ever been to London before,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.160]   so we're researching.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.640]   We got the plan.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.960]   We're going to see Buckingham Palace.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.880]   We're going to see Churchill's War Room.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.240]   We're going to go see the bridge and the Eye of London.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   We just had everything worked out.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   And when we got there, because I'd never been to London,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.160]   I didn't know how similar it was to New York City,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.200]   and that the primary way that most people get around town
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   is taking something called the--
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.680]   anybody know?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.480]   My staff team is right here.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.400]   The Tube.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   This brother's been to London.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.040]   And you take the Tube.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.240]   The Tube is the subway version in London
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.560]   of how most people get around.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   It's basically a train that will take you all over the city.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   Here's why I love the Tube.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.280]   Much like the subway in New York, for $5,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   you can go anywhere you want in the city.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   Unlike what an Uber--
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.360]   the same amount if you paid towards an Uber of $5,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920]   you're going to get one block over.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   If you take the Tube, you put $5 on something
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.800]   called an Oyster card, and it loads you up
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.280]   to be able to go anywhere you want.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.360]   You can go up to Chelsea.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.600]   You can go over to Kensington.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.240]   You can go see all that there is to see for such
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.920]   an incredibly cheap price.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.600]   So we loaded up, got ready.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560]   We took the Tube everywhere we were going to go.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.240]   And something happens whenever you're not
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   familiar with the grid lines of a train organization,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.240]   or train system, so to speak.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   There are times where you want to go to some area north
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.840]   in North London, or in East London, or some area
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.520]   to go see some tourist attraction.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.140]   And you get on a train that you think
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.800]   is taking you in that direction, only
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.040]   to realize you are headed in entirely the opposite direction
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.360]   of where you want to go.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.240]   This happened multiple times for us, because neither of us
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.400]   had been really to London.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.360]   So we looked at it.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.720]   We're like, oh, we need to get on the A line
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.440]   and come up here, only to realize
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   we were headed in the complete opposite direction
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.000]   of Buckingham Palace, or of whatever site
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.360]   that we were going to see.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.760]   So in that moment, what do we do?
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.200]   Well, we get off the train.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.840]   We identify.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.000]   We begin to try to attempt to find,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.800]   how do we get to the destination we're actually
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.040]   attempting to go?
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   Well, the answer, of course, you need
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.000]   to get on a train headed in the right direction
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.760]   of that destination.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.960]   Now, what does it have to do with anxiety?
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.160]   Well, really a lot, because just like there's trains,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.280]   and depending on which train you get on,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.440]   it's going to take you in a direction and ultimately
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.120]   a destination, our minds and our thoughts
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.440]   work in really similar ways.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.600]   In other words, every time that you have a thought,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.160]   if you and I choose to allow and dwell on that thought,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   we continue to invite other thoughts like it that
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.880]   lead us in a direction in life.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.920]   They begin to fill our mind, fill our mindset,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.080]   as it relates to anxiety or anxious thoughts,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.120]   and they take us in a direction.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.580]   What I want to cover tonight is one
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.200]   of the most important aspects of experiencing a peaceful life,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   and that is learning to think rightly.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.120]   The Bible over and over hits that there
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.520]   are thoughts that should fill you and I's minds.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.800]   There's a way that you and I are to dwell on truth,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.040]   as we'll talk about here in a second.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.680]   But if you cannot conquer the ability to think rightly,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.060]   you will not be able to address your anxiety.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.440]   So we're going to dive in for the next handful of minutes
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.320]   and really look at two ideas or two points from this text.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   One of them is related to realizing,
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.720]   the other is replacing.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   One of them is realizing, and the other is replacing.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.200]   In Proverbs chapter 23, verse 7, it says this.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.480]   "For as a man," or as he thinketh,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.600]   the King James Version says, "or as a man thinks within himself
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.320]   so he is, your thoughts take you in destinations."
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.760]   And I'll unpack and explain more what I mean.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.120]   But the first aspect to you addressing your anxiety--
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.920]   this is so huge--
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   you have got to realize your anxious thoughts lead you
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   in the direction or destination of anxious feelings.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.240]   Anytime you feel anxious-- listen to me--
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.000]   every time you feel anxious on the inside,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.960]   those anxious feelings are coming
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.160]   from some anxious thinking that is behind them.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   Your thoughts direct and influence
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.680]   the destination of your life, and they direct and influence
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.080]   the experience that you're going to have with anxiety.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.640]   The anxious feelings often lead us to reach out.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.400]   And out of the fact that nobody likes to feel anxious,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.000]   we turn to anything that can kind of give us
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.800]   some sort of peace.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.160]   So you turn in order to numb yourself to a bottle
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.520]   or to just check out through scrolling through Instagram.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.440]   Or anytime there's some sort of anxiousness,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.480]   out of the overflow of trying to get relief from that,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.360]   we will reach out to find something that will help us
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.760]   experience more peace.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.160]   But tragically, we seldom address the anxious thoughts
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.880]   that are behind and fueling and feeding
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.720]   those anxious feelings.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.920]   In other words, first idea is that you have to realize
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.240]   anxious feelings come from anxious thinking.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.480]   Just like I mentioned getting on a train
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.120]   and how there's trains of thought that we get on,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.360]   if you allow your thoughts and the idea of a train of thought
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   we even recognize like, hey, thoughts can lead you places,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.840]   which is why we have this term of train of thought.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.600]   If you get on the wrong trains of thought,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.200]   it will take you towards the wrong destination
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.520]   and lead you in the wrong direction,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.960]   the wrong direction away from peace and towards anxiety.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   And you've got to begin to address
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.560]   what are the anxious thoughts that are feeding
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.280]   and fueling the anxious feelings that I have on the inside?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.320]   What are the trains, the trains of thought
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.560]   that I'm getting on that are taking me away from peace
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.720]   and towards anxiety?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.920]   Some of the more common trains of thought
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.840]   that I think are common just for, you know,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.240]   in my life or young adults and have seen over the years
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.040]   would look like some of these.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   This is what I call the WebMD train.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.120]   This is the train of thought that you get on,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   you wake up in the morning,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.680]   you got like some weird neck pain or something in your back
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.640]   and you're like, oh man, what is going on?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.360]   And rather than just saying likely,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.860]   it's probably that I just slept weird,
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.760]   my pillow was in a weird position.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.640]   You begin to go, man, I think I may have like something,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.120]   like there's a growth or something inside of here,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.000]   like neck pain.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   And I go to WebMD, I pull up the app,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.840]   I type in on symptom checker, these are my symptoms
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.680]   and I'm making a walkthrough,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.240]   like, oh, this is what I'm feeling.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.200]   Inevitably, when it pulls up possible diagnoses,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.240]   it always includes things like, you know,
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   oh, you got back pain,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   or that could be kidney failure or a appendicitis rupture,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.720]   or, you know, cancer is in there.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.320]   For some reason, cancer makes every single list of like,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.200]   thank you WebMD for just making me anxious.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   And all of a sudden,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.480]   what was just a little bit of back pain
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.820]   from sleeping in a weird way,
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.720]   you begin to go down that WebMD, you know,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.200]   train of anxiousness and you go,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   oh my gosh, I'm going to die.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   I'm too young to die.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.320]   I didn't know back cancer was a thing.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.400]   Who's going to take care of my dog whenever I die?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.040]   And what could have been a moment
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.720]   that wasn't filled with anxiety, all of a sudden is.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.000]   And you feel anxious because anxious thoughts
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600]   fueled and fed that.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   If you're going to address that anxiety that you feel,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.880]   you've got to address the anxious thoughts
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.220]   that are behind it.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.880]   Another one as common as the
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.840]   reading into the relationship train.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.000]   So this happens early in a dating relationship,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.960]   happens anytime in a dating relationship early.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.720]   But let's say you just started dating a guy,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.240]   you know, you're three dates in,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.940]   he drops you off at your house,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.800]   you get there and he comes up, gets out of the car.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.840]   And he says, man, I had a great time.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.100]   And he proceeds to give you a side hug.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.720]   You turn away after getting that side hug
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.480]   and you begin to walk into your apartment
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.520]   and all of a sudden you start overanalyzing,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.360]   what does I had a good time mean?
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.560]   And side hug?
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.600]   A side, what am I, your cousin or something?
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.560]   And you begin to plan your tape.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.520]   Oh, he's going to break up with me.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   He's not interested in me.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   He was just doing this, like giving it one last chance.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.440]   I'm not even sure I want to keep moving forward with this.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.120]   This thing is over, rover.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.080]   And you begin planning your tape.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.360]   There's probably some other girl out there.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.200]   I bet he likes Sarah.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.400]   And without even realizing it,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   you jump on that train of thought.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.680]   And the next thing you know,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.160]   you're scrolling through Sarah's Instagram,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.760]   checking out how many times your boo,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   you thought he was your boo, but no more,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.280]   has been liking her posts and her pictures.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.840]   And you begin to think, maybe I need to break up with him
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.680]   before this thing ends.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.560]   I never even liked him that much to begin with.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.680]   'Cause you jumped on that train.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.800]   And trains of thought take us places.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   Another one would be the my boss doesn't like me train.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.440]   Lauren has this one all the time at work.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.960]   She's on my team.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.880]   No, I'm totally kidding.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.400]   Where all of a sudden, in a moment,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.560]   you send an email, you say something in a meeting,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.680]   you do something where you're like,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.240]   here's what I think we should do.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.880]   And you begin to go, oh man, he did not respond to that
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.440]   the way that I was hoping they would respond.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.920]   I felt like everyone thought that was a really bad idea.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.520]   And you begin to think, oh,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.420]   I better like look for something else to do.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.040]   I'm on the chopping block next.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   Or you send some email to your boss about whatever it is,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.800]   and he doesn't respond for a few days.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.880]   And you go, man, did he not get the email?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.000]   No, of course he got the email.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.960]   It couldn't have gone to spam.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.120]   We work at the same company.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.840]   Oh man, I bet he's going to let me go.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   I'm next on the chopping block for sure.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.840]   He thinks all my ideas are stupid and dumb.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.680]   And the next thing you know,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.560]   you are looking up your LinkedIn profile
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.000]   and trying to find your password
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.880]   'cause you can never find the LinkedIn password,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.920]   trying to update your resume
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.200]   'cause you're afraid you're going to lose your job.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.640]   And you hopped onto that train
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.220]   and without ever even trying, all of a sudden,
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.200]   you were moving towards the destination
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.400]   of anxiety and anxiousness.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.460]   The most common train of thought
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.160]   that a lot of people get on,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.120]   I was talking to a counselor
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.720]   and just preparing for this series.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.300]   He described it's just the what if train.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.500]   We hop on this what if,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.840]   and we begin to think about the future
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.000]   and think about hypotheticals
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.840]   and what if this could happen.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   And we begin to fill our mind with ideas of like,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.520]   man, what if I get COVID-19?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.300]   What if something does happen to my parents?
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.680]   What if they're not able to afford retirement
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.220]   and I end up having to take care of them
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.060]   for the rest of my life?
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.200]   What if I'm single for the rest of my life?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.020]   What if I get married and I can't have kids?
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   And you begin to live in some future hypothetical land
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.880]   out there that only robs you of peace right now
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.920]   and moves you in the destination of anxiety
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.440]   because your thoughts,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.080]   if you do not address your anxiety at a thought level,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.480]   you're not gonna experience peace.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.800]   And you've gotta recognize and realize
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.920]   my anxious feelings are a trigger
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.360]   that there's anxious thinking
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.560]   that is coming into my head.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.500]   And I've gotta address and deal with that anxious thinking.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.500]   The apostle Paul in Philippians chapter four,
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.360]   as we read last week,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.940]   launched into a conversation about anxiety.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.420]   And last week we laid out that he said,
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.740]   hey, don't be anxious about anything.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.180]   Philippians chapter four, verse six says,
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.180]   but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.660]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.660]   and the peace of God, which transcends understanding,
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.880]   can't understand it, it's beyond words,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.820]   will guard your hearts and minds.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.460]   And then he immediately launches into this next thing.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.340]   So he says, don't be anxious, pray to God,
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.060]   and also do this.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.020]   He says, finally, brothers, whatever's true,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.660]   whatever's honorable, whatever's just,
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.660]   whatever is pure, whatever's lovely,
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.740]   whatever's commendable, if there is any excellence,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.300]   if there's anything worthy of praise,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.060]   think on these things.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.260]   So he doesn't just say, hey, don't,
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.540]   remember the biblical definition,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.980]   this is gonna be really helpful for you.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.700]   Maybe this is your first time tuning in.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.800]   The biblical definition of being anxious
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.140]   is not having an anxious thought.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.380]   It's dwelling on anxious or fearful thoughts.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.420]   It's sitting there, replaying them, rehearsing them,
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.100]   thinking about them, focusing on them,
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.220]   dwelling on those things.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.420]   Paul says, don't do that.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.340]   If you have fearful thoughts, they're gonna pop up.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.540]   They're occasionally gonna fill your mind,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.360]   but don't dwell on them, don't hold onto them,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.500]   don't meditate on them.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.640]   Instead, meditate on these things.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.040]   Get on these trains of thought.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   And he lays out, hey, whatever's true,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.160]   whatever's honorable, whatever's pure,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.320]   whatever's worthy of excellence,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.120]   these are the things that should fill and flood your mind.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.320]   The second idea that Paul talks about
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.720]   is you and I have to replace,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.800]   if we wanna experience peace,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.280]   we've gotta replace our trains of thought.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   Now, before I launch into that,
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.960]   here's one thing that is highly related
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.340]   to whether or not you're gonna experience peace,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.160]   or highly related to how you can address
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.520]   the trains of thought.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.120]   You have got to examine
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.800]   what is feeding your anxious thinking.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.840]   Your anxious feelings come from anxious thoughts.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.560]   What is feeding those anxious thoughts?
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.480]   I don't know what it is for you,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.740]   but I know every single one of us,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.360]   there are things that can fill in a moment
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.960]   our anxious thinking.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.320]   Maybe it's scrolling through social media,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.220]   and you need to take a break from social media
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.280]   because you get on there, and every time you do,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.520]   it fills your mind with how much you don't have,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.320]   how discontent you are with life,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.280]   how sad you are that they, you know,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.580]   you saw a picture of somebody
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.440]   posting their engagement pictures,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.800]   and what floods your mind is,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.320]   I'm gonna be single for forever,
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.520]   I'm gonna be the cat lady that grows into old age
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.340]   with 47 cats, nobody cares about me,
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.680]   and what could have been a moment of peace
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.560]   is a moment of anxiety,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.000]   'cause you jumped on that anxious train,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.280]   because something was feeding it, social media.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.120]   Maybe it's the news.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.360]   Like, it's borderline impossible to turn on the news
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.920]   and not feel anxiety coming up,
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   being bombarded with, you know, virus spread,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.960]   political craziness, racial tension,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.360]   and that's just in America,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.640]   and then now we got global news,
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.800]   versus like back in the day,
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.160]   in order for you to be, you know,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.040]   anxious about Pakistan 50 years ago,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.600]   it would take a while to get over here,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.900]   and now with the click of a button,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.060]   you can be worried about things
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.280]   you didn't even know existed 'til five minutes ago,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.880]   and you need to watch, what are you feeding yourself?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.720]   What is filling your head, filling your mind,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.680]   filling your thoughts?
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.520]   'Cause if it's filling your thoughts,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.160]   and it's anxious or fearful,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   it's gonna fill your heart with anxious feelings.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.440]   You've got to address what you're feeding yourself.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.520]   Maybe you need to get off, you know,
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.700]   like to know it, or Pinterest, or just online shopping,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.880]   because when you do, you get on there,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.760]   and you scroll through 1,000 different, you know,
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.060]   bridal dresses or clothing that you can't afford,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.900]   or whatever it is,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.420]   and it just feeds something inside of you.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.700]   It is impossible to live a peace-filled life
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.600]   with anxious thoughts,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.560]   to live a content life with discontent thoughts.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.240]   As we read earlier, the Proverbs say,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.280]   "As a person thinks, so they are."
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   Your life is being shaped by how you think,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.460]   and what you think is being shaped
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.580]   by what you're feeding it.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.140]   You may need to take a break from dating apps,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.540]   because every time you're on there,
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.260]   your emotional joy of that day goes up and down
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.700]   based on whether or not you get a match.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.880]   And you find yourself quickly scrolling through,
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.940]   disappointed, almost self-loathing,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.980]   'cause you're like, man, another day,
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.660]   and nobody liked me, no one will ever like me,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.220]   and you're feeding something that is not helpful.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.180]   If you want to experience peace,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.940]   you've got to address the anxious thoughts,
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.900]   and if you want to address those,
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.340]   you've got to address what's feeding those,
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.180]   'cause Paul would say,
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.460]   "You need to replace that with the truth.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.860]   "You need to replace that with God's word,
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.720]   "and hold on to what is true."
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.500]   By thinking about what you're thinking about.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.940]   Over and over, the Bible talks about this.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.980]   If you want to experience transformation in your life,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.460]   you've got to change the way that you think,
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.240]   which is why Paul said, "Hey, get off those trains.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.820]   "You need to get on these trains."
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.140]   If the trains of thought you're dwelling on
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.100]   are not true, lovely, good, right, pure, noble,
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.860]   you need to get off of those.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.900]   Imagine how you and I's life would change
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.620]   if what filled our hearts
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.420]   was not thoughts of fear, but of faith.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.820]   Not thoughts of how temporary things around us are,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.740]   but eternal, like this life is a vapor.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.260]   I'm going to be in heaven forever and ever.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.520]   No matter what I face, I can handle it,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.740]   'cause this life, the scripture says, is like a vapor.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.780]   It's like when it's cold outside and you breathe,
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.860]   and it's there and it disappears.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.840]   It puts it into perspective.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.220]   So now whatever I face today, I'm like,
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.140]   man, I'm going to be okay.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.780]   If my life was filled with thoughts,
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.580]   not about myself, but about others.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.820]   If it was filled not with thoughts about
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.880]   negativity, but positivity.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.780]   If you were to examine the thoughts that you've had today,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.500]   how would you describe them?
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.540]   Were they more all like the world thinks?
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.380]   Or more like God describes,
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.480]   and what God says is important?
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   Were they more peaceful or more anxious?
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.540]   Were your thoughts about yourself
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.200]   more negative today or positive?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:15.180]   Begin to audit and think about what am I thinking about?
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.080]   Because you're going to experience an anxious life
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.500]   if what fills your heart or fills your mind
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.340]   is anxious thoughts.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.940]   Imagine how our life would change
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.140]   if what flooded through our mind constantly,
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.940]   I know my life does and would and is,
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.700]   and experiences peace when what floods my mind
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.220]   are thoughts like these.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.260]   May God is good, he's in control.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.100]   I can trust him.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.060]   God is good, he's in control.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.900]   I can trust him.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.720]   God is good, he's in control.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.820]   No matter what I say, God, you're good.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.820]   You're in control.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.480]   People think they're in control.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.860]   People think that society and the population
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.960]   decides what's going to happen.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.700]   You've already determined and you're over everything.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.840]   I can experience peace.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.400]   You promise that no matter what I face, God,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.540]   you are going to work it together
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.120]   for the good of those who love you.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.980]   You're going to work it together for good in my life.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.460]   You're going to use it.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.660]   No matter how hard it is to bring about good in my life.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.280]   God, no matter what I walk through, I'm never alone.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.860]   You are with me.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.740]   I've never been alone.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.300]   I'll never be alone because you've promised in your word,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.160]   you'll never leave me nor abandon me.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.620]   How about thoughts like God has promised,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.540]   I'm going to meet all of your needs.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.820]   God will meet all of my needs.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.780]   If I need it, God will meet my need
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.960]   because he cares about me.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.820]   That's like my sexual past doesn't define me.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.720]   Sin that I've committed doesn't define me.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.520]   What Christ did on the cross, that's what defines me.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.360]   That's what defines me.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   That's what define me.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.400]   How would your life change?
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.420]   How much negative self-talk would end?
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.800]   How much more peace would you experience?
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.920]   Paul would say, you have got to begin
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.100]   to replace second idea, the trains of thought.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.000]   If they're not noble or right or pure or lovely
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.200]   or admirable, or really just,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   if they're not consistent with God's word,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.920]   you've got to begin to replace those trains of thought
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.740]   in your life.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.240]   The final idea, I know I just said two,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.200]   but I'm going to almost bracket into a third one
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.780]   is that in order to experience peace,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.480]   you've got to realize the full truth in your life.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.920]   You've got to begin to realize in the midst
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.040]   of those moments where I feel anxious,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.720]   what is the anxious thought?
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.920]   Here's what I'm feeling.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600]   I feel anxious.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.320]   What anxious thoughts are informing this?
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.400]   Man, I feel anxious that my mom is getting older
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.200]   and I'm worried she may get COVID
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   and she could get sick and die.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.360]   Okay, so now I'm feeling anxious about that.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.200]   The thoughts that are informing that,
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.040]   in order to experience peace from that anxiety,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.120]   I got to address those thoughts
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.020]   and address them with the truth from God's word.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.880]   What do I mean by that?
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.320]   Like here's why, here's the power
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.600]   of a lot of the anxious thoughts.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.760]   It's so important, so stay with me
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.320]   and I'll try to explain it as best I can.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.160]   The power of the anxious, the reason why you're anxious
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.540]   is because a lot of those thoughts
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.000]   that fuel your anxious feelings,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.800]   there is some truth in them.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.120]   That's what makes them powerful.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.200]   Like if it was like, oh my gosh, I'm anxious right now
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.560]   'cause my mom is going to get eaten by an alien,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.620]   you probably don't struggle with that.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   You probably have never been like,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.320]   oh man, that's a realistic scenario.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.800]   What makes our anxious feelings so strong
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.080]   or the power in them is that there is some truth
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.660]   in the ideas or the thoughts
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.280]   that are feeding those anxious thinking.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.560]   So in order for you to address that,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.140]   you've got to get into not just a partial truth
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.680]   because there is some partial truth
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.440]   inside of the things that feed our anxious thoughts,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.260]   but the entire truth.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.120]   Like, let's use that example.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   Like, man, I'm anxious right now.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.480]   I feel anxious 'cause I'm worried
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.720]   my mom's only getting older.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.240]   Maybe she could die from COVID.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.000]   That's being fueled by anxious thoughts
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.240]   that, okay, she's 68, she has an autoimmune disease,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.740]   she has whatever, yada, yada, yada.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.280]   Those are all realistic thoughts.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.000]   She could die by COVID.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.920]   That's true, but it's only part of the truth.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.720]   The entire truth, God's word tells us,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.120]   is that God is in control over everything.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.440]   He's determined your mom's days before she ever existed.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.120]   He will not allow her to die one second
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   before he is already determined.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.860]   She's going to live the number of days,
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.000]   whether or not COVID is there,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.460]   that he has allotted and planned out for her.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.000]   And that's the entire truth.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.280]   So I can either rest and promise that,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.720]   God, you're over all of that.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.120]   Nothing's going to happen that you didn't see coming,
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.480]   that you're not in control over,
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.740]   and I can have peace, or I can just be anxious.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.280]   But I'm believing part truths that are behind that.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.520]   The weird thing about part truths,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.760]   which are generally speaking what is filling,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.100]   honestly, I think it's almost always half truths,
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.300]   or not the entire truth that fuels
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.200]   and feeds our anxious feelings and our anxious thinking,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.820]   is that by nature of being half true,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.260]   that means they're half not true.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.140]   It could be true, or they're half true,
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.220]   which means they could be half lies.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.680]   They're not necessarily the truth.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.820]   And the way that you and I combat them
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.280]   is with the entire truth, which comes from God's word.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.660]   What does God actually say about this?
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.620]   And it gives me a perspective,
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.700]   an ability to address the anxious thoughts that I have.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.700]   Maybe you find yourself wrestling with half truths,
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.820]   if you will, of things like this.
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.380]   Like, man, I'm never going to be able
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.060]   to conquer my depression.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.940]   My brother will always be an addict.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.380]   I'll never be able to get out of debt.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.220]   I don't have friends that care about me.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.660]   I'm never going to get married.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.720]   I'll always be alone.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.540]   The power of those things is,
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.120]   I mean, there is some truth in them.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.840]   It's just not the entire truth.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.600]   I'm never going to get married.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.640]   I'll always be alone.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.320]   What makes that powerful is there is some truth in that.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.640]   You may never get married,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.760]   but the entire truth is that if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.160]   you'll never be alone.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.840]   You've never been alone.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.120]   God has promised you may be single, but you're not alone.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.420]   And the only thing that can fill a hole in your heart
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.260]   that lacks some relationship that you want
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.520]   is not a relationship with a person.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.720]   It comes from God.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.020]   And you may not believe it right now,
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.200]   but that is the truth.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.120]   That's the entire truth.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.440]   And you can allow those anxious half-truths
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.680]   or anxious thoughts to fill your anxious feelings.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.760]   But if you begin to address them
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.880]   with the truth in God's word, God will never be alone.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.200]   This life is a vapor.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.400]   Whether I'm single or not,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.300]   I can experience an amazing life.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.400]   We've already seen, I mean,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.920]   Jesus, who experienced an amazing life,
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.680]   or Paul, who didn't lack anything in life.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.440]   He experienced the abundant life the Bible calls him.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.600]   Neither of them were married.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.200]   They didn't get to heaven, experience and lack here.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.000]   And so as I begin to combat the lies
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.560]   or the half-truths with the entire truth,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.840]   I begin to experience peace.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.680]   Maybe you find yourself thinking,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   "Man, I'll never be good enough.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.200]   I'm never, all the other people,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.240]   like they're so much better than me.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.560]   They're gifted in ways that I'm not.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.120]   I just feel like so insecure about myself."
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.280]   And there's a part truth in that.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.680]   You'll never be good enough.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.080]   But the Bible says that's not the whole truth.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.880]   The entire truth is that because of Christ
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.800]   and your relationship with him and Christ in you,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.520]   you are more than enough.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.880]   It even says that in our weakness,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.040]   in the places where, AKA,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.200]   this is 2 Corinthians chapter 12,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.920]   it says, "Hey, wherever you're weak, AKA not enough,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.680]   not smart enough, not pretty enough, not talented enough,
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.240]   in all of those places, God is more than enough,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.400]   and his power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.320]   So I can either dwell on,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   "Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.340]   I'm so insecure.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.180]   I don't like who I am."
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.620]   Or I can say, "Man, all of the weaknesses
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.040]   that I bring to the table, God is bigger and better.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.480]   And in the midst of the weakest places in my life,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   God can show his power, show up and show himself.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.420]   He's more than enough."
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.640]   That's the whole truth.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.340]   Maybe you find yourself thinking, "I can't change.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.800]   I'll always be depressed.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.580]   I'll always be addicted.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.840]   I'll always be whatever it is.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.180]   I'll always have dysfunctional relationships."
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.520]   The reason why that I can't change is powerful
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.240]   is there is some truth in it,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.700]   but it's not the entire truth.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.960]   It is true.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.800]   I can't change.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:20.440]   But the Bible says the entire truth is that through Christ,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.820]   God can change you.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.160]   That's the entire truth.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.540]   And he can bring that about in your life.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.200]   As you walk with Jesus, as you study his word
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.220]   and you begin to apply it,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.180]   and you surround yourself with God's people,
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.400]   he will begin to change you.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.240]   Maybe you struggle with thinking
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.700]   that your value is found in how you look.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.520]   And here's what, let me just tell you, it is.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.020]   Your value is found in how you look,
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.920]   how much you make, how much is in your bank account,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.880]   to the world, to people who do not matter,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.120]   whose opinions do not matter.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   And you get to decide,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.600]   am I gonna let the opinions of the world around me
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.760]   determine my value,
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.800]   or am I gonna embrace the entire truth,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   which is that it may matter to them,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.680]   but my value is not determined by them.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.880]   My value has already been determined by God,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.320]   who gave his life for me by sending his son on the cross.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.160]   And he said, this is how valuable you are.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.640]   It has nothing to do with how much you make,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.680]   how your figure is, what job you have,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.400]   the car that you drive, what family you came from,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.240]   the color of your skin.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.080]   Your value was determined
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.520]   when Jesus gave his life on the cross.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.440]   And you can either allow that entire truth to define you,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.000]   or you can allow the opinions of people who don't matter
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.960]   or whose opinions don't matter to define you.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.440]   But that's a half truth, it's a part truth.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.760]   It's not the entire truth
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.000]   which is found, contained in scripture.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.680]   As I've already mentioned,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.520]   there are so many people who experience fear,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.800]   panic, anxiety.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.600]   Right now, it seems like it's as high
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.240]   as it's ever been in culture.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.280]   It's pandemic going all around us.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.240]   People flooded with fear over what if,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.560]   what if I die, what if my parents die,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.840]   what if I get sick, what if something happens?
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.600]   And the worst thing I could say is like,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.120]   oh no, that won't happen, like God's for you,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.440]   nothing can stand against you.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.280]   Even viruses, that's not the truth.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.200]   There's a part truth, you may get sick.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.240]   Someone you love may get sick.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.880]   Something could happen like that.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.520]   But it's not the entire truth.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.320]   Everything you face in life,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.640]   you will face, you have face.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.160]   God is in control over.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.560]   He's numbered your days.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.280]   He loves you and He's for you.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.400]   You can trust Him.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.680]   Worrying about it is not gonna help you.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.400]   It'll just make you anxious.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.800]   Having anxious thoughts over what if
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.840]   is not gonna help you.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.200]   It'll just make you anxious and feel anxious.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.320]   And He's saying, hey, in those moments
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.560]   where you begin to go on that train
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.120]   and you begin to fear and you begin to,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.560]   what if and what if and what if,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.760]   He said, no, hold onto what is true.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.280]   Truths that you find in God's word.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.600]   A lot of us, and I'll close here.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.440]   You may be thinking like, man,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.720]   I just don't know how to study God's word.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.120]   I just don't know where to go in the Bible
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.160]   and I don't know what to do.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.080]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.240]   In that moment, as you begin,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.160]   hopefully you have a small group
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.040]   or hopefully you have a community group.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.120]   I want you as you feel, you go,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.640]   what am I feeling right now?
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.560]   I'm afraid, I'm anxious.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.400]   I'm worried.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:43.840]   Begin to ask the question, why?
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.560]   What are the anxious thoughts that are informing that?
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.080]   What truth from God's word would apply to those?
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.760]   If you don't know, then bring your small group in and go,
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.320]   hey, here's the anxious thoughts that I'm having.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.480]   What would God's word say?
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.880]   'Cause I don't know it as well as you guys do.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.720]   Will you help me understand?
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.400]   Like what would God's word say about the faith
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.440]   that I'm just really afraid I'm gonna lose my job
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.960]   and I'm really afraid that I'm gonna be single.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.200]   What would God's word, how would it help me understand
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.280]   what lies I may be believing from there?
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.320]   This is also why it's so important for you
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.920]   to begin to spend time in God's word.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.080]   Doing what Romans chapter 12, verse two says,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.280]   is the way that you and I experience transformation.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.160]   By not being conformed by how the world thinks,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.440]   but be renewed, have your life changed.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.960]   By transforming, have your life transformed
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.560]   by changing or renewing your mind,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.360]   by reading God's word and beginning to apply.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.480]   And when I find myself anxious,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.120]   asking what anxious thoughts are feeding into this,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.080]   the anxious feelings that I have,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.480]   and what lies may be behind that?
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   What's the entire truth from God's word?
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.200]   And you know what's gonna happen as you begin to do that?
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.800]   Like this is the truth about anxiety.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.480]   It doesn't go away overnight.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   Anybody tells you that?
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.640]   Generally, maybe every once in a while.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.400]   I just have never seen it.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.960]   It takes a process.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.920]   It's a journey in life.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.800]   If you struggle with anxiety, it takes time.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.760]   And it takes working through,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.640]   and it takes renewing your mind
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.280]   in order to retrain the way that you think.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.160]   And as you do, and you study God's word,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.280]   and you begin to address the things
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.920]   that make you anxious with God's word,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.720]   you're gonna experience increasing amounts of peace.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.280]   And you'll experience the ability to more quickly recognize,
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.120]   hey, I'm getting on a really anxious train
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.120]   that is not helpful.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.760]   It's gonna take me in a direction.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.040]   It's gonna take me to destination anxiousness,
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.280]   and I don't wanna go there.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.400]   And you'll quickly say, gotta get off of that.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.000]   I'm gonna hold on to what's true.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.240]   When I was in London,
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.320]   we visited some friends that lived in the town.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.960]   They were really familiar with where everything was,
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.920]   they knew where the eye was,
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.360]   they knew where all the tourist attraction was,
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.880]   and not just that.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.160]   They knew all the tube routes.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.120]   They knew all the subway routes, if you will.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.880]   So we'd go with them, and here's what never happened,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.560]   not one single time.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.720]   We'd ride around with them,
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.160]   and previously, when it was just me and JP,
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.080]   we'd be like, oh man, I do not know
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.280]   what we're looking at right now,
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   and they have some different English words
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.760]   that are different from the words that we use,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.160]   and what are we looking at?
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.760]   And we would, at times, get lost.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.840]   Not one single time did we get lost when we were with them.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.560]   We'd get on, and if we were tempted to be like,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.560]   oh, I think we need to take C,
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.320]   they'd be like, nope, don't need to take C,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.160]   we need to take E.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.920]   The E line is where it's gonna take us
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.160]   up to where we wanna go.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.880]   They knew it because they were familiar with it,
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.840]   because every single day, they were around it,
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.320]   they'd just kinda eat, sleep, and breathe the tube.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   That's how they got around.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.640]   They were familiar with it.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.160]   So they didn't get on the wrong trains as easily as we did.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.960]   But they didn't get there overnight.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.080]   They didn't grow up, or there was nothing miraculous.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.360]   They weren't born with the understanding
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   of the tube layout system.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.600]   Now, what does that have to do?
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.360]   People who are able to identify,
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.120]   I don't need to get on this anxious train.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   I need to get on the train of truth from God's word.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.400]   It takes time.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.620]   It takes knowing it, being familiar with it,
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.440]   and the more that you grow in your knowledge
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.840]   and understanding of God's word,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.760]   the more you identify, hey, I'm feeling anxious about this,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.880]   here's anxious thoughts informing it.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.280]   I wanna fight those with the truth.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.360]   I wanna get on the right trains.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.680]   The easier and quicker it will be,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.960]   and it takes time, and it's a process,
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.240]   but it is the path towards peace,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.800]   or you can continue to be anxious,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.760]   which won't help, always hurts,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.440]   and it doesn't have to be the experience.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.600]   Final half-truth in here,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.700]   and some of you are believing,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.100]   is that you are too unworthy to ever go to heaven.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.340]   That is a half-truth.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.920]   It contains a little bit of truth in it,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.760]   because you are too unworthy to go to heaven.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.280]   The Bible says that all of us have fallen short
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.920]   of the standard of God, which is perfection,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.320]   that all of us have fallen short
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.500]   of God's glorious standard, Romans 3:23,
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.480]   that if it came to you on your own,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.500]   you are unworthy to go to heaven,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.040]   but that is not the entire truth.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.480]   If you're buying the lie that I'm too unworthy,
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.800]   I'll never be able to go to heaven,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.160]   that's partly true.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.560]   You are too unworthy, but because what Christ has done,
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.780]   he has allowed anyone who would just trust in him
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.040]   as the only one worthy, who gave his life
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.560]   for every unworthy person like me,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.020]   like every ear and person listening to this message.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.320]   If you'll put your trust in what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.180]   he will make you worthy, not because he will change you
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.000]   and make you like this imperfect person
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.480]   that deserves to go to heaven, no.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.240]   It's only by what Jesus did on the cross
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.740]   that you and I are made, or allowed,
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.400]   or given the worthiness that only Jesus has,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.600]   that only Jesus deserves,
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.040]   that gives us access to eternal life.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.960]   And you've embraced a part truth by thinking
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.360]   you're not good enough to get into heaven,
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.680]   or you are a good enough person,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.000]   so I'm pretty nice and I'm pretty good,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.600]   so that's probably what will get me in.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   Those are both lies.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.320]   The truth from the Bible is that God will allow anyone,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.400]   and every person is unworthy,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   and he allows any unworthy person to have eternal life
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   if they'll accept the free gift of putting their faith
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.780]   in what Jesus did for them on the cross,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.820]   paying for every sin they ever committed.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.860]   And when they do, they have become worthy
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:14.100]   of experiencing eternal life in a moment by faith.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.620]   And you need to embrace, you've embraced a part truth.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.100]   The entire truth is that God has gone out of his way
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.860]   to make it so that you could have a relationship with him
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.860]   for all of eternity and have experience of peace
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.260]   for all of eternity.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.100]   Let me pray.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:33.500]   Father, I pray for anyone listening to this message
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.260]   that has never put their faith in Jesus,
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.020]   that you would make them more anxious
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.900]   than they have ever been about where they stand with you,
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.660]   about what happens after they die,
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.020]   in order that would prick them and lead them
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.500]   to reach out to you and receive
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.820]   the free gift that you gave by giving your son.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.380]   That wouldn't make them try to be a good person
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.900]   or attend church more or do more good things,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.700]   but it would make them realize they can never do enough.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.540]   And they would experience peace
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.160]   when they trust in what you did on the cross.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.340]   I pray for every person that's listening to this message.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.300]   And we're all in varying degrees on a journey with anxiety.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.540]   Would you help us to take steps
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.020]   by getting off the wrong trains,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.060]   addressing the lies we believe with the truth?
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.860]   Would you move us increasingly in the direction of peace?
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.940]   Though we may not be fearless overnight,
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.940]   that we, as we follow you, would fear less in our lives.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.260]   We love you and we worship you
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.220]   and we thank you for Jesus.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.200]   In his name we pray, amen.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
