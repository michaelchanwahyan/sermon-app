1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 Hey!

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,480
 (congregation cheering)

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,800
 How's it going, Awaken?

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,960
 Excited to be here.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,980
 You know, what I feel right now

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,040
 is I just wanna pray again, and I'm going to.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,400
 And here's why.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,720
 Because that song we just sang, we need it to be true.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,340
 And I was singing it down there.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,200
 I'm real big about things being real and true in my heart.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,320
 I don't wanna get up here,

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,760
 and I don't wanna preach something that I'm not living,

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
 that I don't really truly believe.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,600
 And I'll be honest, I'm singing those words down there,

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,180
 and I'm going, God, can you beat down the shadows?

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,520
 Can you beat back the lies?

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
 'Cause that's what we're saying,

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,240
 is that the lies are nothing compared to the power of God.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,260
 We're saying and singing that the shadows and the darkness

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,200
 is nothing compared to the power of God.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,700
 And so God, help us believe what we just sang.

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,960
 Help us believe that the lies and the darkness

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,740
 and the shadows have nothing on you.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,040
 Help us believe that your spirit is bigger and better

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 and more powerful and more beautiful.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,100
 God, I think of the heaviness that I've been under,

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,780
 and I imagine that so many people here have been under.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,660
 If that's you, just say yes.

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,500
 I just pray.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,140
 I know there are so many people, God,

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,900
 that are fighting anxiety, depression, fear,

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
 paralyzing fear, addiction, the brokenness of relationships,

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,860
 the desire for relationships, God.

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,180
 And it feels like, okay, I'm gonna get up today,

35
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,860
 I'm gonna do the next thing, but God,

36
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,140
 the power and authority that you've given us,

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
 it feels far away.

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,900
 And so right now, we pray that your power,

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,740
 your authority would come on this place,

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,880
 that the spirit would move to and fro in this room,

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,660
 that the lies, the darkness, the enemy would be pushed away.

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,140
 And we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,780
 And I believe it.

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,420
 All right, y'all ready?

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,240
 Let me introduce you to my people,

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,500
 because that always helps.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,580
 I always like to know what's this girl coming from.

48
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,940
 Let me just show you the chaos that I'm coming from.

49
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,720
 They're awesome.

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
 They're awesome.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,820
 And you know what?

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,280
 I am tired.

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,980
 And that's why.

54
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,780
 And largely, what I worry about, it's not the world,

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,660
 it's not these huge issues that to some degree

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,060
 I'm helping lead with, it's largely,

57
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,260
 is my seventh grade son going to make it

58
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,460
 without going to juvie?

59
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,620
 Like those are the things we think about a lot at our house.

60
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,980
 And so let me just give you a little more context.

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,460
 This is this week, my daughter sends this text.

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,540
 Let me show you what she sent.

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,140
 Real quick here.

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,380
 This is to me and her dad.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,740
 (congregation laughing)

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,660
 Yeah, that's the operation we're running.

67
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,180
 (congregation laughing)

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,100
 Yeah, I was like, does that feel appropriate to send to us?

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,060
 Yes, we shut down, I'm sorry, yes.

70
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,140
 That's the world we're fighting.

71
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,180
 And it does feel like the darkness is pressing in.

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,940
 And here's how I wanna start today.

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,860
 You all are hearing incredible things.

74
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,940
 You all are getting filled up left and right.

75
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,300
 I want to give you a chance to process where you are

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,420
 before we get going in this message.

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,180
 I want you to think about where am I right now?

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,340
 And to do that, I want you to write some things down.

79
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,220
 If you have a paper and pen, pull that out.

80
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,700
 If you wanna write it on your phone,

81
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,540
 you can write it on your phone.

82
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,460
 But I want you to write down a simple answer

83
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,740
 to each one of these questions.

84
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,580
 You ready?

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,460
 What do you want?

86
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,100
 What do you want?

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,860
 What do you want?

88
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,300
 What are you longing for?

89
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,260
 And then what are you grieving?

90
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,660
 Because I would say that a lot of life

91
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,700
 really exists around these two places

92
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,540
 in our hearts and our minds.

93
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,860
 What do you want and what are you grieving?

94
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,300
 What are you worried about?

95
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,860
 What are you hoping for?

96
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,020
 Okay, so I want you to jot down two sentences.

97
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,660
 We're actually gonna give you a minute to do that.

98
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,780
 I want you to pray about it, ask God, what is it?

99
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,180
 There is not a right answer to what you want,

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,940
 but there is a real answer.

101
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,820
 And I want you to write that one down.

102
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,780
 All right, I'll give you just a minute.

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,420
 (gentle music)

104
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,020
 (gentle music)

105
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,620
 (gentle music)

106
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,220
 (gentle music)

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,820
 (gentle music)

108
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,420
 (gentle music)

109
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,020
 (gentle music)

110
00:04:47,020 --> 00:05:11,580
 All right.

111
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,260
 Now this can go one of two ways, this moment.

112
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,900
 I'm gonna ask you to do something brave

113
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,300
 and it's gonna be uncomfortable.

114
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,140
 And I want you to talk to your neighbor

115
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,580
 and I want you to tell him what you just wrote down.

116
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,860
 It was a mean trick, wasn't it?

117
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,620
 Such a mean trick.

118
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,580
 This is gonna go somewhere, I want you to trust me.

119
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,060
 And depending on how you strategically play,

120
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,580
 okay, go ahead, y'all are already doing it,

121
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,500
 just do the thing.

122
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
 (audience laughing)

123
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 (audience laughing)

124
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 (audience laughing)

125
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 (audience laughing)

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,900
 All right, all right, all right.

127
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,820
 Some of you are like, I need some counseling,

128
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,140
 can you help me?

129
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,740
 No, okay.

130
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,340
 We're gonna get a little braver.

131
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,020
 I want some of you to say your two sentences out loud.

132
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,900
 Now not the thing you'd say to the counselor,

133
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,060
 but just, you know, what you wrote down,

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,260
 just I want blank and I'm grieving blank.

135
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,580
 All right, so raise your hand

136
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,420
 and here's what we're gonna do,

137
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,220
 'cause we get some mics in the back.

138
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,980
 What we're gonna do is we're gonna go fast,

139
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,060
 'cause I wanna get as many answers as we can.

140
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,340
 So if you're willing to share,

141
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,700
 I want you to raise your hand, look for a mic,

142
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,980
 and let's go, let's do this thing.

143
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,300
 Hi.

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,460
 Hi.

145
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,340
 I want unity.

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,580
 Unity between everybody so that everybody

147
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,020
 can promote the kingdom of God

148
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,700
 and that everybody gets all the unity,

149
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,580
 'cause God wants us to unite to spread his--

150
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,740
 Grieving.

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,460
 So yeah, unity.

152
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,300
 You're grieving.

153
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,140
 Ah.

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,220
 You don't get to just share the easy thing.

155
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,060
 Yeah.

156
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,740
 Grieving?

157
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,580
 Oh, that's a tough question.

158
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,780
 I really don't know what I'm grieving.

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,620
 Okay.

160
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,660
 I got one right here.

161
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,620
 Oh, hi, I'm Claire.

162
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,020
 So what I really want is to be perfect

163
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,780
 in everything, and I'm grieving my own sin

164
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,140
 and my own character flaws.

165
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:01,500
 I want to glorify God,

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,180
 and I am grieving unfulfilled dreams.

167
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,540
 Hey, I'm Mark.

168
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,980
 What, let's see.

169
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,740
 Oh, what do I want?

170
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,660
 I wanna go full-time ministry,

171
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,740
 and then what I'm grieving is nature.

172
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,660
 I'm new to Texas, and there's no mountains.

173
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,300
 Yeah, and a lot of concrete.

174
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:31,260
 Hi, I'm Izzy, and I want to serve the Lord

175
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,540
 along with my future husband in other countries

176
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,540
 and have a family, and I'm grieving rejection

177
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,540
 from my real dad leaving me when I was a baby

178
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,660
 and boyfriends and all that.

179
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,660
 So I'm Zeus, and I wanna be a traveling missionary.

180
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,860
 I feel like there's so many need across the world,

181
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,620
 and we here in America, we're in like a small bubble,

182
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
 and we just need to help across the world,

183
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,780
 Afghanistan, everywhere.

184
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,620
 I'm grieving for all my loved ones that aren't saved,

185
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,980
 and I pray that one day God will bring them home,

186
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,660
 for we are all lost puppies in need of home.

187
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,260
 I'm Gabby, and I want pure joy,

188
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,140
 and I want to make God's heart glad,

189
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,260
 and I am grieving the death of my father and my past life.

190
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,860
 Hi, I'm Allie.

191
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,700
 I want to get married, and I'm grieving lost time

192
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,180
 and past mistakes.

193
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,460
 I'm Michelle, and I want my life to emulate him

194
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,580
 and only him, and so I'm grieving my control

195
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,420
 and the ability to let go of my plans and what I want.

196
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,580
 I'm Lacey.

197
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,860
 I want to raise children to love God,

198
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,460
 and I'm grieving infertility.

199
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,820
 Hi, I'm Courtney.

200
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,900
 I'm craving emotion and not to be numb all the time,

201
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,260
 and then what I'm grieving is a future

202
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,740
 I had in mind for myself.

203
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,060
 I'm Justine.

204
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,980
 I want to feel whole and loved,

205
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,340
 and I am grieving a recent divorce and sexual trauma.

206
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,820
 All right, I want you to look at these lists,

207
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,780
 and how many of you relate to things that are up there?

208
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,740
 Okay, I want you to keep your hand up for a minute,

209
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,540
 and I want everybody to look around,

210
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,820
 'cause y'all are all jacked up together.

211
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,140
 (congregation laughing)

212
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,540
 And isn't that comforting?

213
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,140
 I talked to a counselor once about these questions,

214
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,500
 and he said, "We spend so much time

215
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,740
 "with this voice in our head.

216
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,540
 "We've got these desires that we want,

217
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,420
 "and then there's this other voice in our head.

218
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,580
 "There's a part of us that's judging what we want

219
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,740
 "and judging what we're grieving."

220
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,300
 Right, anybody else have a busy mind like that?

221
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,100
 And yet, these are just, you know, that was pretty raw.

222
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,820
 Y'all just said what you want, what you're sad about,

223
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,700
 and the whole room related.

224
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,660
 Together, we are struggling.

225
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,980
 Can we agree to that?

226
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,660
 Can we just start right there?

227
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,500
 Together, we are struggling,

228
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,100
 because how many people feel like

229
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,460
 whatever they struggle with, you are struggling alone?

230
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,900
 Just in your room at night.

231
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,580
 That's not okay.

232
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,060
 That's not okay.

233
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,020
 There is an epidemic, and it's a fairly new epidemic,

234
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,140
 actually, it's loneliness,

235
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,660
 and loneliness has actually only been

236
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,260
 in the last, you know, few hundred years.

237
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,060
 There wasn't a lot of documentation

238
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,220
 about loneliness prior to that,

239
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,420
 and it's rampant now.

240
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,780
 Three in five people pre-COVID felt lonely.

241
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,340
 So post-COVID, what's that number gotta be?

242
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,500
 Five in five, four and a half in five?

243
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,340
 I mean, we definitely have a problem

244
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,300
 that people are lonely,

245
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,860
 and yet, how many people want to be lonely?

246
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,980
 I mean, some of you are introverts,

247
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,380
 don't raise your hand, okay?

248
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,260
 'Cause you don't really,

249
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,380
 you need somebody to still be there for you.

250
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,460
 You may not wanna use as many words as me,

251
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,700
 but you need somebody to be there for you.

252
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,100
 So how many people want to be lonely?

253
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,100
 None of us, and yet, most of us are lonely and disconnected,

254
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,380
 and that is a problem, and yet, we're all

255
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,980
 unanimously jacked up, struggling.

256
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,780
 Those words, we feel those things together,

257
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,380
 and yet, the enemy is good,

258
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,420
 because he has tucked us in our corners on the planet

259
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,420
 all alone and made us feel like we are struggling alone,

260
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,460
 and in the dark with the devil,

261
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,580
 he can tell you whatever the heck he wants.

262
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,820
 The lies are real, the lies are strategic.

263
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,820
 The lies are real, the lies are strategic.

264
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,740
 I love what Jefferson talked about this morning.

265
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,900
 Ooh, it was so good, because what he did was he said,

266
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,540
 "Hey, here's the story you're a part of.

267
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
 "Here's what God's doing throughout history.

268
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,520
 "We're taking up a little bitty dot

269
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,260
 "on this incredible, amazing adventure of eternity.

270
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,020
 "We're living our moment.

271
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,420
 "We're living our second.

272
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,660
 "And yet, we're a part of something bigger.

273
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,580
 "We're a part of something bigger."

274
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,780
 And so, I actually wanna go back with Jefferson.

275
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,900
 I'm gonna go back to Genesis,

276
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,020
 and we're gonna look at this,

277
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,900
 because here's the deal, guys.

278
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,180
 The greatest weapon that God has given you

279
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,560
 to fight the dark, to fight the enemy,

280
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,520
 apart from this book and knowledge of him,

281
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,940
 is other people.

282
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,700
 We need each other.

283
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,540
 This is war, and we're treating community

284
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,720
 and connection like happy hour.

285
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,260
 So, we've got to start by getting really serious.

286
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,660
 See, I just did a study of this

287
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,500
 for the last year of my life,

288
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,380
 and what I found was that,

289
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,020
 what I didn't wanna do was I didn't wanna

290
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,180
 write a book about friendship.

291
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,440
 I was like, "That's so cheesy.

292
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,620
 "I don't want flowers and friendship."

293
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,420
 I'm like, "I don't think that's what this is supposed to be,

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,220
 "because this epidemic is requiring more than just,

295
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,020
 "let's find our two to three best friends

296
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,100
 "and ride off into the sunset together."

297
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,900
 No, we're at war, and we need fighting buddies.

298
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,860
 We need people holding our arms up.

299
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,700
 Yesterday, when I was tempted

300
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,540
 to just spin in anxiety and sadness last night,

301
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,340
 and it was just about the world, guys.

302
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,900
 It wasn't even about today.

303
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
 I was excited about today.

304
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,900
 It's just the heaviness of the world and leading in it.

305
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,300
 And instead, I go downstairs.

306
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,460
 I tell people to pray.

307
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,660
 I bring people in, because we cannot do the things

308
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,480
 God's called us to do on this earth alone.

309
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,620
 So, let's go back to Genesis.

310
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,740
 What did he say?

311
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,620
 Some of you know it.

312
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,400
 He creates a human.

313
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,860
 He sets them on the planet, and he says what?

314
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,180
 It is not good for man to be alone.

315
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,900
 And all the men said, but guess what?

316
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,100
 Some of you need a good fat kick in the pants.

317
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,200
 You need to ask some girls on a date here.

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,300
 It is not good for you to be alone, but guess what, girls?

319
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,460
 The implication was for marriage, sure,

320
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,580
 but it also was God was creating out of something, right?

321
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,720
 Eternity is forever.

322
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,380
 It's always been, and God has always been.

323
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,940
 And he has existed in community within himself.

324
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,260
 The Trinity, Tim Keller calls it the great dance,

325
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,180
 that the three members of the Trinity are in relationship.

326
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,260
 And when God created, he did not create in a vacuum.

327
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,340
 He created out of community, community within himself.

328
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,100
 He created out of love.

329
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,340
 He created out of sharing this awesome,

330
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,060
 eternal relationship with us.

331
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,980
 And so, he creates, he sets the man down,

332
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,020
 and he looks at the three of them, and it says,

333
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,740
 "So we created man in our image," right?

334
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,040
 He uses the plural tense throughout Genesis 1.

335
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,620
 It's real interesting 'cause God doesn't often do that.

336
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,040
 Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness.

337
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,320
 It's very intentional that God is speaking

338
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,740
 from the Trinitarian God,

339
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,100
 that there are three and there are one.

340
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,480
 Some of you didn't even know this was about Jesus,

341
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,660
 more or less, you don't know what the Trinity is.

342
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,500
 Let me just tell you this.

343
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,340
 It's very complicated.

344
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,120
 I went to seminary, and I don't know.

345
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,080
 But, but God is three and God is one.

346
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,000
 And the three, one God created out of relationship.

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,620
 He created a man, looks at the man, and he says what?

348
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,740
 "It is not good for him to be alone."

349
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,640
 So he created Eve, and together they created a family,

350
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,820
 and that family grew into a people group,

351
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,900
 and that people group divided into many nations, okay?

352
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,600
 That's the story of the people.

353
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300
 On the earth.

354
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,660
 And so our Trinitarian God, he creates a man,

355
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,540
 he creates a family, he creates a community, a people group.

356
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,560
 And then he writes this book throughout history

357
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,060
 through many people, and the whole book is about people.

358
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,420
 The whole book.

359
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 People groups, families, people that screw up,

360
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,980
 hurt other people, wars, it's a lot of people.

361
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,640
 The whole thing is written, in fact,

362
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,400
 almost every passage that you have memorized,

363
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,040
 that you have heard since you were a kid,

364
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,320
 when you hear the word you, you took it to mean you.

365
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,260
 But almost every single time in the Hebrew and the Greek,

366
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,460
 it is a plural form of you.

367
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
 The book was written to people.

368
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,660
 Not an individual, not a person, people.

369
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,600
 And then we have an enemy.

370
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,500
 Because the people of God coming together

371
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,220
 in a powerful way defeat the darkness.

372
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,400
 Wherever two or more people are gathered,

373
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
 I will be with you.

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,780
 The people of God will, in the end, defeat the enemy.

375
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,080
 It's where this will end.

376
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,300
 We're a powerful group of people, especially together.

377
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,140
 The Spirit of God is in this room,

378
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,260
 the word of God is being preached,

379
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,880
 and the saints are gathered, and that's dangerous to hell.

380
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,320
 So what does the enemy want to do?

381
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,820
 He wants to defy God's people.

382
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,760
 He wants you to be hurt, so hurt, so wounded.

383
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,980
 Because let's think about it.

384
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,060
 What are the best parts of life,

385
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,260
 and what are the hardest parts of life?

386
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,780
 Both probably involve people.

387
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,740
 The best parts of your life involve people,

388
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,820
 and the hardest parts of, is that true?

389
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,980
 Why is that so true?

390
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,980
 And so of course this is not easy.

391
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,720
 Of course this is not simple.

392
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,980
 This is war.

393
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,300
 This is war.

394
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,780
 And the more the enemy can get you alone in the dark,

395
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,220
 the more power that he has.

396
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,020
 So what do we do?

397
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,860
 We fight back.

398
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,760
 And we don't treat this like happy hour,

399
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,900
 like we need a few friends to come over for dinner.

400
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,600
 We treat this like it's war.

401
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,100
 So if God is relationship,

402
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
 and he created us for relationship,

403
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,500
 and the enemy hates this so badly,

404
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,900
 what does it look like for us to fight?

405
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,180
 See, we aren't meant to just taste

406
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,940
 little glimpses of community, like a great meal.

407
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,260
 I'm sure this weekend,

408
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,900
 you all will have incredible meals together.

409
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,940
 I hope you will.

410
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,880
 You will connect with great people.

411
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,060
 You will have just incredible conversations.

412
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,300
 But it's not meant to be in two or three days

413
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,140
 on a conference.

414
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,380
 It's meant to be lived out in your day-to-day life.

415
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,540
 If you look back throughout history, which I just did,

416
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,960
 I literally looked back throughout biblical history,

417
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,220
 the history of mankind,

418
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,100
 and what you will see is that all of life

419
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,460
 has been done in village-like communities.

420
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,260
 In fact, most of the earth today

421
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,820
 lives in village-like communities.

422
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,340
 And together, what they do is they make fires,

423
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,580
 love fires, something about a fire, right?

424
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,940
 I mean, not like burning the house down fire,

425
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,520
 but at night, we got a fire pit,

426
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,380
 and some of my favorite moments have been

427
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,820
 Devi Flowers coming over with her keyboard or her guitar

428
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,060
 and just singing in the backyard.

429
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,180
 And yeah, that was special.

430
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,100
 I'm lucky that she's my friend.

431
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,540
 (audience laughing)

432
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,020
 Praying and singing and being with people that I love.

433
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,420
 There's something about a fire.

434
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,460
 And throughout history, most villages,

435
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,700
 they cook by a fire, they converse by a fire,

436
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,380
 they come together by a fire,

437
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,620
 and at night, they would tell stories by a fire.

438
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,560
 This is how almost every generation on earth has lived.

439
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,780
 They didn't live with doors, with locks.

440
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,020
 If you go right now to Rwanda or Uganda,

441
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,460
 you'd see the same thing that I saw,

442
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,660
 which is most people have huts and no doors,

443
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,780
 and they have a big fire pit in the middle,

444
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,300
 and they all come out, and they come in,

445
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,740
 and they share what they have,

446
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,500
 and they walk down to get water,

447
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,780
 and a lot of their day is spent together

448
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,420
 taking care of things that, yes, involve survival,

449
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,420
 but require community.

450
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,340
 It's a beautiful way to live.

451
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,980
 I got to interview someone that actually grew up

452
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,260
 in the slums of India, and he told me,

453
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,620
 we were talking about how incredible his life is now.

454
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,600
 He lives in Atlanta, and the great story,

455
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,100
 and he was telling that story to help raise money

456
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,940
 for a great nonprofit, and it was a really positive story,

457
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,500
 and at the end, while I was writing this book,

458
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,460
 I said, "What do you miss?"

459
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,300
 And he teared up.

460
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,060
 And he said, "I wish my kids would be known

461
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,100
 "like I was known in the slums of India."

462
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,820
 I mean, I would go out, and I would get in trouble,

463
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,700
 and everybody knew my name, and they knew my grandmother,

464
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700
 and they'd say, "Your grandmother's gonna hear about this."

465
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,300
 And he said, "I wish people just stopped by."

466
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,940
 He said, "Used to, all of my friends,

467
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,620
 "we'd be playing out in the trash,

468
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,240
 "and we had nothing, nothing,

469
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,140
 "but if we were lucky that day

470
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,500
 "and could scrape together some bread and rice,

471
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,700
 "my grandmother would fix it,

472
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
 "and it didn't matter if those kids

473
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,240
 "had eaten somewhere else.

474
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,100
 "She never asked, she just fed 'em bread and rice,

475
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,820
 "whoever came through her door."

476
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,700
 And he said, "You know,"

477
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,260
 and he knew he wasn't supposed to be negative

478
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,660
 'cause he was raising money, you know,

479
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,220
 to her child sponsorship, which I do believe in,

480
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,620
 but he said, "You know, I don't know in that way

481
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,740
 "if it's better here."

482
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,260
 He said, "I'm afraid we're growing up really,

483
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,220
 "I'm raising my kids really lonely."

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,520
 There is an epidemic,

485
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,560
 and there is a foundational reason

486
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,800
 that as a generation we feel so isolated,

487
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,280
 but we can fight this.

488
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
 There is a way to fight this.

489
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,800
 So we have several things not on our side.

490
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,720
 One, we grew up in a very independent society, right?

491
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 We've grown up with literally founding our country,

492
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
 the Declaration of Independence.

493
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
 Like, we are independent Americans,

494
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,680
 and that is those of us who are in the middle of it.

495
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,020
 That is those of us that are,

496
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,740
 and that is how we've been raised.

497
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,320
 I mean, if we were in Texas,

498
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,100
 I mean, we're worse, you know?

499
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,180
 (congregation laughing)

500
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,900
 I mean, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

501
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,820
 I'm sorry, that was written in Texas.

502
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,920
 Like, that came from a Texan that wrote that, some cowboy.

503
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,900
 This is how we were taught to live.

504
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,860
 It's how we think.

505
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,460
 It's very difficult to even lift you out of this mindset

506
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,920
 and for you to imagine there could be

507
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
 a different way to live.

508
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,940
 And so what we've got to start with is we have to fight this.

509
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,960
 We have to fight to have this.

510
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,060
 We have to want this bad enough

511
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,020
 that we're willing to sacrifice for it,

512
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,380
 because the way that many of you do community,

513
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,160
 the way that you think about it is, you know,

514
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,260
 a girls' night out or, you know,

515
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,780
 so coming together at church with a big event.

516
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,280
 That is not community.

517
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,600
 Now, to some degree, what I just forced you in,

518
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,580
 that would count, 'cause that was real.

519
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:40,680
 What we have to do is we have to want this bad enough

520
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,960
 that we are willing to, you ready?

521
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,320
 I'm terrible at what I'm about to say.

522
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,400
 We have to be willing to need people.

523
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,360
 We have to be willing to need people.

524
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,200
 It is so uncomfortable to need people.

525
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
 It isn't easy.

526
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,040
 It isn't, I hate it.

527
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,720
 In fact, I have had good friends quit me,

528
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,720
 very good friends quit me, decade-long friend quit me.

529
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,840
 And they told me that.

530
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,880
 They looked at me in the eyes and they said,

531
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,520
 I don't wanna be friends anymore.

532
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,300
 And the reason that multiple friends have quit me

533
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,100
 is because of the same phrase.

534
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,240
 It has haunted me.

535
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,360
 You don't need me.

536
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,000
 Like, I want to need you.

537
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,240
 I don't know how to need you.

538
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,640
 I'm working on it.

539
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,680
 I'll go to therapy.

540
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,440
 I don't know.

541
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,660
 It is not easy to need each other.

542
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,360
 And here's the thing.

543
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,420
 It's vulnerable.

544
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,600
 And some of you just did it.

545
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,160
 Some of you stood up and you said things

546
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,600
 that were incredibly vulnerable.

547
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,880
 And I just wanna say, well done.

548
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,600
 Because that is the first step of needing each other.

549
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,920
 It's actually saying what is wrong.

550
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,280
 My friends, I have, one of them is here today.

551
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,440
 I call them my friend coaches

552
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,760
 because I knew I was bad at this.

553
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,060
 And so I said, okay, you need to help me do this.

554
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,240
 And so we would get together and they would say,

555
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,560
 I want you to share what you need.

556
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,120
 Like, what is it that you're feeling?

557
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,240
 What is it that you're sad about?

558
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
 What are you anxious about?

559
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,560
 And you know what I felt?

560
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
 My first reaction was,

561
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,680
 I'm gonna take up all the oxygen in the room

562
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
 and I'm gonna keep it short.

563
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
 And I don't wanna, you know,

564
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,800
 I don't know how long is right to talk.

565
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,640
 Like, I am just really awkward

566
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,780
 is what I'm learning about myself.

567
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,880
 And I needed to say it, but it was so hard.

568
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,700
 Now, some of you are professionals at this, you know?

569
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,640
 Some of you are like, I share my problems way too easily.

570
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,680
 Good for you.

571
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,040
 Good for you.

572
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,640
 I don't.

573
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,240
 I was taught that I need to lead out of strength.

574
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
 I need to have the answer.

575
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
 I need to help people

576
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
 and not draw too much attention to myself.

577
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,400
 And so needing people isn't comfortable at all for me.

578
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,880
 So we need to need each other.

579
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,420
 And we also have to initiate.

580
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,760
 We have to initiate.

581
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
 Quit waiting for people to initiate with you.

582
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,440
 They're not going to do it.

583
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,160
 I hate to say that,

584
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,660
 but we are all staring at our phones most of the time.

585
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,760
 We are not making plans.

586
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,840
 We are not imagining our next little fireside chat.

587
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
 We are not inviting people in.

588
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,080
 We are waiting to be invited

589
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,480
 and we have to become those who invite.

590
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,960
 Jesus was king of this.

591
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,480
 He walked into a town and was like, come to dinner.

592
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
 Guy in the tree, let's go.

593
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,480
 Come on, let's go.

594
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,300
 I'm going.

595
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,160
 No, he was even better.

596
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
 He needed him and he initiated.

597
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,760
 Guy in the tree, let's go to your house for dinner.

598
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,700
 I'm going to impose my posse on you

599
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,500
 and we are going to come all to dinner tonight at your house.

600
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 Do you understand how beautiful it is

601
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,640
 when somebody just says, hey, let's do this.

602
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,040
 Let's do this.

603
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,600
 Come with me.

604
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,320
 Let's go to your house.

605
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,160
 You know?

606
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,680
 It is a little bit of an imposition and awkward

607
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,480
 and it's so good.

608
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,220
 One of my friends, she's here.

609
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,160
 We moved to Dallas a few years ago

610
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,880
 and I had very few, if any, friends

611
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
 and I decided I needed to make friends

612
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,640
 'cause this was important and so I tried.

613
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
 And again, obviously awkward.

614
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,760
 Like, I mean, so awkward this girl is.

615
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,800
 And so I don't know how to do it

616
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,620
 but I know that I liked this one friend

617
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,280
 and I think she liked me.

618
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,160
 And then one night, she shows up at the door

619
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,720
 with her kids in tow, with her husband

620
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,520
 and they just taking Christmas card pictures

621
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,600
 and I'm in my robe.

622
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,280
 And I opened the door and I'm like, hey, new friend.

623
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,280
 Hey, we just wanted to see your,

624
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,320
 I wanted to show my husband your backyard, patio furniture.

625
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,360
 I think he's going to love it.

626
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,180
 Do you care?

627
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,240
 It's all their, all our kids, you know?

628
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
 And I'm like, and they look beautiful.

629
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
 And I'm like, sure, come on in.

630
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,900
 And then y'all, they came to the back

631
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,860
 and of course, what do we do?

632
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,480
 We lit the fire.

633
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,820
 They sat down.

634
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,680
 I stayed in my robe.

635
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:30,820
 We pulled weird snacks out from the pantry.

636
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,960
 Their kids crawled all over me

637
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,220
 and I have never been happier

638
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,220
 because I knew she's my friend.

639
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,560
 And she wasn't afraid to just bust in.

640
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,760
 And she wasn't afraid to say,

641
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
 although she kept saying, we should go, you're in your robe.

642
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,680
 But,

643
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,280
 but she stayed, she stayed.

644
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,280
 We initiate, we initiate and we need each other.

645
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,080
 And then point three, you ready?

646
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,480
 We fight to keep this.

647
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
 We fight to keep this.

648
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
 Let me tell you, if the enemy hates this

649
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
 and this is one of the most powerful weapons

650
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,800
 that we have to fight the dark,

651
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,780
 then we have to not give up so easily.

652
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,040
 I want you to think about the people in your life

653
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,160
 and especially the people that have hurt you

654
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,520
 or that you have hurt and how easy it is to walk away.

655
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,280
 When I look back at the history of the world,

656
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
 people couldn't walk away.

657
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,600
 Like they literally lived with the same 50 people

658
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,520
 their whole lives.

659
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,040
 Like they literally couldn't leave.

660
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,200
 So if they got in a fight,

661
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
 it would be awkward, awkward, awkward.

662
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,760
 But eventually they'd work it out.

663
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,800
 It's called like they smoked a peace pipe or something.

664
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,960
 I don't know, but they worked it out.

665
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,640
 They literally had rituals to work things out

666
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,560
 because they couldn't go anywhere

667
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,680
 unless they wanted to take their whole family

668
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,600
 and their friends and set up a whole new tent city,

669
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,220
 you know, and that was a lot of work.

670
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,600
 So what they do is they would stay.

671
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,480
 Well, we have the luxury of moving on and moving on

672
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,800
 and moving on and moving on and moving on

673
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
 and never putting down roots

674
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,120
 and taking the better job in the cooler city

675
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,240
 and leaving behind people that know us.

676
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,440
 And that's, you know, it was interesting

677
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,960
 when I did all the work biblically on this,

678
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,480
 there's so much, there's so much

679
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
 about community in the Bible,

680
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,920
 but there never was much about staying

681
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,360
 'cause people just stayed.

682
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,600
 And if they left,

683
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,960
 they left with a whole people group somewhere

684
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,960
 and they took their families and they stuck together.

685
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,760
 It's how people have lived throughout history.

686
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,640
 We're one of the first generations that thinks it's okay

687
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,060
 to just abandon a great deep community for a better job.

688
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:59,480
 We walk away too quickly.

689
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,760
 Now, what I did find in scripture that was really clear

690
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,400
 was a lot of one another's of how we would do this together.

691
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
 And it sounds really, really Christian.

692
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,640
 I'm gonna read them to you really quickly,

693
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,560
 but really what they read as is a very long list

694
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,580
 of very difficult conversations.

695
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,260
 Admonish one another, be at peace with one another,

696
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,160
 forgive one another, be of the same mind toward one another.

697
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,360
 How hard is that one?

698
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
 Give preference to one another,

699
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
 bear one another's burdens, love one another,

700
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,880
 be subject to one another, confess your sins to one another

701
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
 and we throw those phrases out like,

702
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,560
 oh, do these things and you'll have great friends.

703
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,040
 Y'all, those are horrible things to do together.

704
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,720
 That list, let me, let me, I rewrote it.

705
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,520
 Let me, let me tell you what I hear.

706
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,640
 Look at your friend and tell them what they're doing wrong.

707
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,540
 That's fun.

708
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,400
 Love so completely that you are willing

709
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,800
 to be rejected by someone and then keep loving them.

710
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,760
 When someone ransacks you, I mean, destroys your heart,

711
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,720
 let it go.

712
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,840
 When you mess up and you feel so ashamed

713
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,300
 and you want to hide instead, call a friend,

714
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,360
 go to coffee and say it out loud

715
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,800
 and then risk that they could use it against you.

716
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,280
 When someone is selfish and horrible to you,

717
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,600
 give them preferential treatment.

718
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,960
 When your person is crying on the bathroom floor,

719
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,680
 get on the floor and cry with them.

720
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:41,440
 When you feel misunderstood, you don't run.

721
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,520
 See, this is not as sanitary and easy.

722
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,880
 And so of course we give up.

723
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,440
 Of course we walk away because this is a you know what show,

724
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,120
 like this is a mess.

725
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,680
 And a lot of you know what I'm talking about.

726
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,840
 And a lot of you know exactly what I'm talking about

727
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,360
 because you've lived in that mess.

728
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,760
 You've been burned and wounded by that mess.

729
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,800
 And I'm saying you don't give up.

730
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
 Now there are times, you know, this is a different talk.

731
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,280
 You draw boundaries and you say, okay, this is too far

732
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,640
 and I need to set a healthy boundary.

733
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
 There is, but you know what?

734
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,120
 We have gotten so good at boundaries

735
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,760
 that we've forgotten perseverance.

736
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,240
 We've gotten so good at boundaries

737
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,580
 that we've forgotten what it means to really forgive someone

738
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,360
 when it feels impossible to do so.

739
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,640
 And we've forgotten that all of the relationships

740
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,680
 we're talking about in this context

741
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,040
 has to do with the blood of Jesus Christ

742
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,960
 that died for our sins, even though we spit in his face.

743
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,120
 See, that's what we're ultimately talking about

744
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,760
 is we can love each other.

745
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,160
 We can fight for each other.

746
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,500
 We can stay because of what Jesus has done for us.

747
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,200
 But we've replaced really deep, messy,

748
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,980
 difficult relationships with years clocked

749
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:05,640
 for shallow supper clubs, shallow conversations,

750
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,820
 shallow connections, and you all, our souls are dying.

751
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,660
 And here's where you see it.

752
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,560
 My friend, Kurt Thompson,

753
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,000
 he's a neuro researcher, counselor dude,

754
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,140
 and he says this, he says,

755
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,220
 "We all come into the world

756
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,160
 "looking for someone looking for us."

757
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,500
 (congregation laughing)

758
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,560
 And then recently we were together and he added to it.

759
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,000
 He said, "Actually, all the humans,"

760
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
 and this is about to save you on marriage counseling,

761
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,900
 so get your pens out right now.

762
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,600
 That Kurt said, "Let's add to that just a little bit.

763
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,760
 "We're looking for someone looking for us."

764
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,500
 And ultimately what we want from everybody

765
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,700
 is that we wanna be seen

766
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,120
 and we wanna be soothed in our hurt

767
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,080
 and we wanna feel safe.

768
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,280
 We wanna be seen, we wanna be soothed,

769
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
 and we wanna feel safe.

770
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,000
 And all the guys are like, "I'm good, I'm good."

771
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
 And let me tell you something, you're really not.

772
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,600
 We all act out of not having this in different ways,

773
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,640
 but all the humans crave this,

774
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,800
 crave this.

775
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,240
 As women, sometimes we're quicker

776
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
 to know that we're craving that,

777
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,520
 but I'm telling you, for the rest of your life,

778
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
 you do this for people,

779
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,560
 people will walk away from you and they will feel loved.

780
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
 I'm sorry.

781
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,320
 I can't imagine how hard that was.

782
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,600
 See, knowledge is not our problem.

783
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,720
 A lot of you came into this and you know

784
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,040
 a lot, you know a lot about God,

785
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,000
 you know a lot about this book, you know a lot.

786
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,360
 Knowledge is not our problem.

787
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:06,360
 We need a good, swift kick in the pants sometimes.

788
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,480
 We don't need to know more.

789
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
 We need somebody that kicks us in the booty and says,

790
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,920
 "Hey, live this and let me help you.

791
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
 Let me help you. Let me not just kick you in the pants.

792
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,800
 Let me tell you about the grace of Jesus

793
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,320
 and let me do it beside you.

794
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,800
 I wanna do this beside you.

795
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,880
 I don't want to leave you in this stuck place."

796
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,200
 Guys, all those things you name,

797
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,520
 let's look at it one more time.

798
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,240
 All those things that you name, that you're grieved by,

799
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,280
 that you desire, all those things,

800
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,120
 we need over that the love of Jesus.

801
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,280
 If you go to people and try to get what only God can give,

802
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,000
 you're gonna be very needy and codependent.

803
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,320
 That is not this sermon though, okay?

804
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
 It's a different sermon.

805
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,240
 You should listen to that sermon someday,

806
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,920
 but that is not what I'm talking about

807
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,640
 because I think that we are so easily protective

808
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,960
 of ourselves.

809
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,000
 We build our fences and our walls and our boundaries

810
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,480
 and we don't let people in

811
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,600
 or we only let them in in this much of a way.

812
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,200
 These are things and places that we need each other.

813
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,160
 We need each other.

814
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,480
 Afghanistan, right now,

815
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,920
 I've been blessed to become friends with a pastor

816
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
 in the underground church in the Middle East.

817
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,040
 And we're just talking often

818
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,000
 and he's telling me what's going on over there.

819
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,080
 And the stories are incredible,

820
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,200
 but guys, they have what we're craving.

821
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,320
 They have what we're craving.

822
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,040
 I wanna read you some of these quotes that he said to me.

823
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,040
 This is before the debacle of Afghanistan

824
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,800
 in the last few weeks.

825
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
 We were talking about community and I asked him,

826
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,240
 are y'all divided in Afghanistan?

827
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,440
 Are you divided?

828
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,960
 Are there lots of different issues that you fight over?

829
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
 And he laughed.

830
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,240
 He thought that was funny.

831
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,200
 And he said this, he said, "Persecution keeps you clean."

832
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,760
 He said, "We need each other.

833
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,920
 "We protect each other.

834
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,040
 "We couldn't live a day without encouraging

835
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,560
 "and eating with each other."

836
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,400
 And he told me about when quarantine happened,

837
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,680
 20 of them moved into the same house

838
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,720
 so that we wouldn't have to live those months alone.

839
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,920
 And most of us, we've lost our families

840
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,080
 because we follow Jesus, so we become each other's family.

841
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,920
 It's not easy.

842
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,480
 And many of the people that follow Jesus,

843
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,480
 they're former Taliban, prostitutes, murderers, drug lords.

844
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,360
 It's not easy, but we love each other and we need each other

845
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,040
 and we would die for each other.

846
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,600
 And then he said this, "True discipleship

847
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,080
 "isn't something you do once a week.

848
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,800
 "It's what you do every day

849
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,760
 "because that's when you get to know people.

850
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,900
 "It's when you're with them through the good times

851
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,380
 "and the bad times, when they're sick

852
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,600
 "and when they're healthy.

853
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,920
 "That's what brings together a true family.

854
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,360
 "The blood of Christ makes us family."

855
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,440
 But we have to experience it together in the everyday.

856
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,600
 We come and go into each other's houses.

857
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,280
 We don't have to call.

858
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,360
 We just go because it's family.

859
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,320
 We eat meals together.

860
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,780
 We go and disciple people together.

861
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,960
 We share life together.

862
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
 It's a community.

863
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,920
 It's what you see throughout the New Testament.

864
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,920
 And then Afghanistan happens.

865
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,060
 We're still talking.

866
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,680
 And everything, the tone has shifted.

867
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,640
 And he tells me the story of one of the leaders

868
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,920
 that actually got out a week and a half, two weeks ago.

869
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,480
 And that person said, "I want you to put me back in."

870
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,080
 And so they sent her back in.

871
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,920
 And before she left, they looked at this person and said,

872
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,920
 "Hey, if we send you back in and we can't get you,

873
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,680
 "is that okay?

874
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,160
 "We're basically sending you to your death."

875
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,020
 And they said, "Do not pull me out

876
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,920
 "if I'm with other believers, do not.

877
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,320
 "Do not pull me out if I'm with other believers

878
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,820
 "because I don't want them to go down alone."

879
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,800
 And I think about this future

880
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,840
 that we don't know what's coming,

881
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,520
 but I know that while we're not daily,

882
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,240
 our lives are not on the line,

883
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,440
 y'all, daily, that list is coming for us.

884
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,240
 The shadows, the lies, the darkness is coming for us.

885
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,740
 And we're just kind of having happy hour together.

886
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,760
 We're just kind of talking about what's going on

887
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,760
 and we're not truly investing in a place and in a people

888
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,320
 and saying, "Hey, you're my person, you're my people.

889
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,400
 "I need you to show up.

890
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,280
 "I need you to show up if something bad happens

891
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,980
 "and I need you to show up tomorrow and the next day

892
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,500
 "and the next day for the good things too.

893
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,280
 "I need you."

894
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,320
 And let me tell you why I started with those questions

895
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,000
 because honestly, that's the fight, right?

896
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,960
 It's what do we want and what are we grieving?

897
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,720
 It's the heaviness that we feel on a given Tuesday.

898
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,120
 It's the hard that we're living in.

899
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,000
 That is it.

900
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
 Like you wanna know where to start,

901
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,280
 this is where you start.

902
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,960
 This is coming in the front door.

903
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,640
 This is the fireside chat.

904
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,360
 This is living life together.

905
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,580
 It is living known and not saying the easy answer,

906
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,840
 but saying the hard one.

907
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,280
 Fighting for each other, not abandoning people.

908
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,060
 But guys, you can't have 50 people.

909
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,280
 You gotta have like a few, a handful, a handful

910
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,340
 that fight for you and you fight for them.

911
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,020
 And some of you are going, "I would love it."

912
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,200
 What you're saying, "I want it, yes, sign me up."

913
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,660
 And that's where I have to say, you're it.

914
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,300
 You've gotta go be it first.

915
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,100
 You've gotta go create it first.

916
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,900
 And we can do that because we have the dearest friend.

917
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,260
 We have the dearest friend, the best friend I have ever had.

918
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,020
 The only one that has never stabbed me in my back.

919
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,460
 Every other one has hurt me in some way on some day

920
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,080
 and Jesus has not.

921
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,540
 And so because of that, because of what he has done for us,

922
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,140
 we actually get to go give away this love.

923
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,580
 And here's what I wanna do as we close.

924
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,380
 I want us to close our eyes and the team is gonna play.

925
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,500
 And here's what I wanna do.

926
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,940
 I want you to reimagine community in your life.

927
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,540
 I want you to imagine a few things and I'm going to,

928
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,500
 and we're gonna pray and we're gonna ask God,

929
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,000
 show us how you want this to be.

930
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,160
 Show us how you want us to live.

931
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,660
 And what are we missing?

932
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:48,780
 So God, the first question that we bring before you

933
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,700
 is what is the point?

934
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,080
 What is the purpose?

935
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,820
 And what do you want us to see

936
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,720
 about the plan that you have for our lives?

937
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,220
 (congregation murmuring)

938
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:24,320
 And I pray you have a vision.

939
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,800
 I pray that as you pray those words,

940
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,000
 that something came to mind,

941
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 a picture of you living out the purposes of God.

942
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,760
 And then the next question I wanna ask is,

943
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,200
 who do you want beside me on this mission, on this purpose?

944
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,880
 And pray for specific names.

945
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,380
 (congregation murmuring)

946
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:59,240
 And then the last question is this,

947
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,560
 who have I not forgiven?

948
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,560
 Where is there still a part of me that I am spinning

949
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,080
 and wasting energy, holding a grudge, being bitter?

950
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:16,200
 And God, would you help us lay that down

951
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,560
 so that our mind and our eyes could be fixed on you

952
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,200
 and the purposes that you have for us here?

953
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,880
 God, I pray for this room that there wouldn't be anchors

954
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,680
 holding them back, that they would be free

955
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,980
 to run the race that was set before them,

956
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,720
 casting off the burdens and the sins

957
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,400
 and entanglements of this life,

958
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:49,160
 fixing their eyes on you, the author of this story

959
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,400
 and the perfecter of this story.

960
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,360
 And I think about these days and how sacred

961
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,280
 and unique they are, that we could be with this many people

962
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,640
 that love God and praise him openly

963
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,120
 and how precious this is.

964
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,560
 And I pray, God, that even as they go out and take breaks

965
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,920
 and spend time together over dinner

966
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,640
 and in the coming 24 hours, God,

967
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,280
 would there be conversations

968
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,800
 that are breakthrough conversations?

969
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,220
 Because God, you have a way,

970
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:23,040
 you have a way of piercing our souls

971
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,880
 with people that love you, that speak your truth,

972
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,760
 that remind us of your truth.

973
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,600
 And so God, I pray that those conversations

974
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,660
 would happen in abundance,

975
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,240
 that people would be set free, God,

976
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,360
 not from the messages from the stage,

977
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,640
 but God, from your spirit,

978
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,660
 entangling yourself through the relationships

979
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,160
 and connectedness of your people

980
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,120
 and that relationships and conversations would go out.

981
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,820
 Yes, and people get married too, that'd be great, God.

982
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,000
 We'll take it.

983
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,720
 'Cause us together as a team on mission for you,

984
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,200
 unified, not distracted, that is powerful.

985
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,640
 That is dangerous to hell.

986
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,060
 So God, make us one so that we can show this world

987
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,360
 how good you are, how delightful you are.

988
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,080
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth

989
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,400
 as it is in heaven, amen.

990
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:29,400
