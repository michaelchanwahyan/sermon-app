1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,680
 - All right.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,400
 Well, welcome friends in the room in El Paso, Phoenix,

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,840
 Tulsa, Austin, Houston, Fayetteville,

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,720
 Philly, wherever you are joining,

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,080
 and especially friends here,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,540
 we are kicking off a brand new series tonight

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,600
 on the Book of Esther.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,440
 One of the most unique books in all of the Bible.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,520
 So if this is your first night,

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,720
 you chose a great night to come,

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
 'cause we're about to open up this book

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,960
 that is like a, if Game of Thrones,

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,760
 The Bachelor and Princess Diaries had a baby,

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,160
 that would be the Book of Esther.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,440
 So it is about to go down in here.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,960
 Hey, let me start by sharing a little bit about me

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,900
 and it'll give us some tracks of where we're going.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,260
 My team would say that I am a little bit of a germaphobe.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,260
 Like I like to keep Purell around me all the time.

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,420
 If you are sick, I don't want you to come into work.

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,640
 Don't be a hero.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,480
 I'm not impressed by how tough you are.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
 You're just being selfish

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,680
 and you're getting all the rest of us sick.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
 Yesterday I was writing this message

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,560
 and I feel like all the coronavirus

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,860
 has only made everybody a little bit more like,

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,240
 (coughs)

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,080
 excuse me.

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,480
 (audience laughs)

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,880
 I was at Starbucks

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,540
 and it was like everywhere that I went in this Starbucks,

34
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,340
 I switched seats three different times

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,280
 'cause I kept sitting next to people who were like,

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,780
 (coughs)

37
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,860
 and you're like, dude, what are you doing here right now?

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,300
 You should be home.

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,900
 And now all of us are gonna be sick because of you.

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,540
 And then I switched seats and I sat right next to a guy

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,920
 and people just like don't know how to cough appropriately,

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,900
 like cough into your arm or into your hand

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,740
 or into your shirt.

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,860
 Don't just let it out there, people.

45
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,260
 And then I went to the restroom

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,000
 and somebody told me this recently

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,420
 and I went to go like wash my hands

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,020
 in the midst of working on this message

49
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,140
 and they didn't have paper towels,

50
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,260
 they only had the air vents.

51
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,860
 And somebody this past week told me

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,380
 that if you wash your hands and you blow dry your hands,

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,140
 you might as well not even wash your hands

54
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,000
 'cause it just circulates all that air

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,500
 and blows all the different things,

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,800
 bacteria and germs that are in the air on there.

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,540
 So I'm like, dude, I'm toast now

58
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,420
 and just thinking I'm for sure, you know,

59
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,060
 gonna get out of here and get sick.

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,220
 And I found myself in those moments going like,

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,580
 man, I just wish I could see the germ presence here.

62
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,380
 Like I wish I had, you know, microscopic eyes

63
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,460
 that would allow me to know like,

64
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,380
 oh man, I can see those things flying

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,260
 through the air right now.

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,380
 Or someone who sat in this chair before me,

67
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,120
 don't sit in that chair 'cause that is the flu chair

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,660
 if you could go over here and just an ability

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,340
 to kind of see 'cause you know it's there,

70
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,280
 you know that they're all around you

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,220
 but you can't really see where all these different germs are.

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,220
 This is going somewhere, by the way,

73
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,900
 I'm not just getting this off my chest.

74
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,460
 (congregation laughing)

75
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,020
 And I wish I had, you know, the ability

76
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,060
 to almost see that microscopically,

77
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,660
 the presence of something I know is there

78
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,220
 but I can't really see it in the moment.

79
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,220
 And the reason I start there is 'cause I think

80
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,540
 that for me, a lot of times I feel that way about God.

81
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,880
 And here's what I mean.

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,340
 Like I know that he's present and I know that he's at work

83
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,140
 but I just can't always see exactly how he's at work

84
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,400
 and what he's doing behind the scenes, if you will.

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,300
 I can't always see like, maybe for you,

86
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,420
 it's in a dating relationship and you're wondering like,

87
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,540
 man, is this person the person that God would have me

88
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,740
 move forward with?

89
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,600
 Or maybe for you, it's a career or job wondering like,

90
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,100
 God, did you just open up a door

91
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,820
 and you want me to walk through that door?

92
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,420
 And is this you working here?

93
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,020
 Sometimes when we look back in life,

94
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,120
 we're able to see like, man,

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,420
 I just think that was a God thing.

96
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,660
 I think he was in all that and I'm sure he had me live

97
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,940
 in that dorm room, you know, back then next to that person

98
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,620
 because this was gonna happen.

99
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,040
 But in the moment, it's really hard to see

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,300
 and I can find myself wishing like,

101
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
 I just knew or I just wish I knew what God was up to.

102
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,220
 I know he's there, I know he's at work,

103
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,320
 but I just wish I could see what I can't see.

104
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,300
 And the book of Esther was a message to the people of Israel

105
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,660
 that even when it looks like God is hidden,

106
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,500
 you can rest assured he's working.

107
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,060
 It's a book that really, the reason I say that

108
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,140
 is throughout the entire book,

109
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,980
 there's something really interesting.

110
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,600
 It's one of two books in the Bible

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,220
 that never mentions the name God

112
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,180
 and never talks about prayer and never talks about God

113
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,820
 and never foreshadows even extra spiritual things

114
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,480
 or supernatural, if you will, things

115
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,180
 in terms of how we often think of miraculous things,

116
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,460
 but it clearly showcases the providence

117
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,900
 or the hand of God moving the pieces around

118
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,180
 and God working and moving the hearts of people,

119
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,980
 the locations of people and directing the lives of people.

120
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,220
 The name Esther even means hidden.

121
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,380
 It was a message that was given to the people of Israel

122
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,260
 to know confidently, even when you can't see God

123
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,960
 in the forefront of him at work,

124
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,600
 you can know he is at work and is working things

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
 for his purposes all around you.

126
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,160
 And so tonight we're gonna start

127
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,620
 and look at the first couple chapters in this book,

128
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,900
 chapters one and chapter two,

129
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
 where we can begin to trace some of the ways

130
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,700
 that you and I can know, hey, this is where God is at work.

131
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,160
 So now we're gonna talk about some of the areas

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,620
 that you can know here is some of the ways

133
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,940
 that God is at work.

134
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,580
 And for us to dive in, I gotta do a little bit of like,

135
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,860
 here's some historical lessons.

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,180
 So everybody put their thinking cap on

137
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,480
 to get a little refresher on what exactly is going on.

138
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,060
 So Esther, Esther is the main character in the book.

139
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,260
 The entire thing takes place in the Persian empire,

140
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,220
 like 500 years before Jesus was around.

141
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,800
 So here's like what the Old Testament is about.

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,380
 If you don't know anything about, you know,

143
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,700
 faith, religion, Christianity, here's what the Bible,

144
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,020
 Bible, two parts, first part, Old Testament,

145
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,700
 second part, New Testament.

146
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,860
 First part, Old Testament is about God's relationship

147
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,340
 with the people of Israel.

148
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,420
 He had something called a covenant,

149
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,580
 which is a relationship that he had with this nation

150
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,900
 called Israel.

151
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,060
 And he basically said, hey, if you worship and follow me,

152
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,400
 it's gonna go really well for you.

153
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,480
 If you worship foreign gods, which by the way, are not real,

154
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
 but if you worship them,

155
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,740
 I'm gonna let you be ruled by foreign rulers.

156
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,940
 So worship me, things go well, worship foreign gods,

157
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,260
 they don't, and you'll be conquered by foreign rulers.

158
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
 They'll all give you over to foreign rulers.

159
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
 In this period, the nation of Israel had rebelled

160
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,340
 against God, they were not listening, so God was like,

161
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,020
 hey, I told you this is what's gonna happen,

162
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,060
 you're basically in time out.

163
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,860
 And he sends this empire called the Babylonian Empire.

164
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,740
 Okay, this is going somewhere.

165
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,660
 They come in, a guy named Nebuchadnezzar,

166
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
 you may have heard the story of Daniel and all that,

167
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
 but it's in the book of Daniel.

168
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,980
 And basically he comes in and he's like, hey,

169
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,940
 I'm now the ruler of you guys and the rest of the world

170
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,500
 and this incredible kingdom.

171
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,600
 And he would do something really interesting.

172
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,980
 When he would go in and conquer,

173
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,420
 he would basically take the best of the best from a city.

174
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,980
 So he goes into Jerusalem, says, I want top 10%.

175
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
 If you're in the top 10%, you are coming with me.

176
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,820
 Top 10% in looks and gifts, intelligence, any arena.

177
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,020
 You're coming with me, and he made them slaves.

178
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,620
 So they lived underneath this and God was like,

179
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,340
 I told you, you need to worship me.

180
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,780
 It goes well, you worship foreign gods,

181
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,200
 you're gonna have foreign rulers.

182
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,860
 But the people didn't listen, they conquered,

183
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,740
 and they had slaves taken to Babylon.

184
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,960
 So then things are going along and this Persian king,

185
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,560
 so a new empire comes on the scene.

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,940
 And the Persian empire comes in and dominates

187
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,180
 the Babylonian empire and they're like,

188
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
 hey, I'm the new ruler.

189
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,820
 And a guy named Cyrus is basically the ruler

190
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,460
 of the kingdom of Persia, sets up the biggest empire

191
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,700
 the world had ever seen, takes out Babylon.

192
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,620
 And he's the most like chill leader, we're told in the Bible.

193
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,700
 We're really told he was a good king.

194
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,100
 Something kind was said about a foreign pagan king.

195
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,900
 Didn't know God, but something nice was said.

196
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,180
 And that he allowed anybody who was slaves,

197
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,860
 he was like, I don't believe in slaves.

198
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,300
 You guys can go home if you want to.

199
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,360
 So anyone who was exiled to Babylon could go home.

200
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,260
 And the Persian empire began.

201
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,040
 And inside of this, there was a Jewish person,

202
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,880
 a part of the family named Mordecai

203
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,320
 and a girl named Esther.

204
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,640
 And they were some of the exiles

205
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,480
 that were allowed to return home,

206
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,840
 but they'd been there and their families

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
 for decades and decades.

208
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
 They were like, this is the only home I ever known,

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
 I'm living here.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
 And the story of Esther takes place

211
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
 inside of this timeframe.

212
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,280
 The Persian empire, so today we're gonna look at

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,860
 inside of that story, where this takes place

214
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,060
 is in modern day Iran in a capital called Susa.

215
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,140
 It was the capital of the Persian empire at that time.

216
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,180
 And we're gonna be introduced

217
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,500
 to really three characters tonight

218
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,140
 that are important for the story.

219
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,780
 So the first one would be Xerxes.

220
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,180
 For this, think Jake Gyllenhaal.

221
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,780
 Here he is, Persian king, he's the most powerful.

222
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,700
 (congregation laughing)

223
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,860
 There he is, looking good, Jake.

224
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,980
 P90X, man, he's been working out.

225
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,340
 He's the most powerful, here's what you need to know.

226
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,160
 Xerxes, real story, this is a true thing.

227
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,520
 Hey, he was the most powerful man on the earth,

228
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,980
 he was the wealthiest person that had ever,

229
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,420
 he had accumulated riches upon riches,

230
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,280
 he conquered the known world by his 30s.

231
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,620
 He ruled over from Ethiopia all the way to India.

232
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,740
 He was just an incredible presence,

233
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,100
 pagan king, did not know God, but that's who he is.

234
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,940
 So you think Jake Gyllenhaal,

235
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
 that's the first character in our story.

236
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,180
 Then we got our girl, Queen E, Esther.

237
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,060
 Who do you think of when you think of her?

238
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,340
 Bella Hadid.

239
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,860
 Bella Hadid, this could be,

240
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,420
 if the guys do not know who this is,

241
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,880
 they're confident because I don't know who it was,

242
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,320
 but she's apparently a model,

243
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
 famous for taking pictures of herself.

244
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
 And this would be kind of who you think of

245
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,880
 in this kind of Persian, beautiful queen.

246
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
 She wins a beauty pageant, we'll see that in just a second.

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,880
 And then her uncle is the one who raises her.

248
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,200
 So his name was Mordecai,

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
 he brings up this orphan girl named Esther, Bella.

250
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,240
 And for uncle, who's the most classic,

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
 iconic uncle of all time?

252
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
 There he is, Uncle Jesse, okay?

253
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
 This is Mordecai, these are the three characters

254
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,940
 in our story, okay, everyone follow me?

255
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,080
 So there's the king, he's ruling the land,

256
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,180
 he rules millions and millions and millions of people.

257
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,240
 He's over everything, you don't mess with the king.

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,080
 Then there's this peasant orphan girl named Esther,

259
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,560
 who's being raised by her uncle, Mordecai.

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,440
 And so we're gonna first dive in and look at the king.

261
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
 I'm gonna just play the movie

262
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,200
 and walk through chapters one and two with you,

263
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,840
 and then we're gonna look at three takeaways

264
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,920
 of how you and I can see and know

265
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,940
 where God is at work around us.

266
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,280
 So I'm gonna start in verse one of chapter one,

267
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,200
 and we will dive in.

268
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,040
 Now these events happened in the days of King Xerxes,

269
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 who reigned over 127 provinces, or you could think nations,

270
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,280
 stretching from India to Ethiopia.

271
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,080
 At that time, Xerxes ruled his empire from his royal throne

272
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,280
 in the fortress of Susa, that's the city, that's the capital.

273
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,780
 In the third year of his reign,

274
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,920
 he gave a banquet for all of his nobles,

275
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,480
 or royalty and officials,

276
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
 and he invited all the military of the Persia and Media,

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,440
 as well as the princes and the nobles of the provinces.

278
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 The celebration lasted 180 days.

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,640
 A tremendous display of the opulent wealth of his empire

280
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,780
 and the pomp and splendor of his majesty.

281
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,380
 So we're told that Xerxes, first thing,

282
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,160
 we're told is he gathers together this celebration and party.

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,660
 He gathers all the royalty from all the different provinces.

284
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,300
 If you're anybody important, you're coming,

285
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,020
 and all of the military, commanders and generals,

286
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,160
 all of you guys come together, we're gonna have a party,

287
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,600
 an anal party, like a Persian party,

288
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,020
 'cause we're about to do this for six months,

289
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,680
 and they go crazy for six months.

290
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,540
 They're just having like an ultimate kegger,

291
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,520
 and they're partying in the city of Susa.

292
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,540
 That's what's taking place.

293
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,940
 And this is going on, and eventually,

294
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,640
 at the end of that time, and here's why he was doing that.

295
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,000
 We know that shortly after this took place,

296
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,180
 he would go in and attempt to conquer Greece.

297
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,000
 It was the only area of the world, known world,

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
 that he hadn't conquered.

299
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,960
 And you may have seen the movie "300" or heard of that movie.

300
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,720
 He's about to go do that and try to conquer Greece.

301
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,560
 So he wants to get all the boys together

302
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,360
 and show 'em how much wealth he has,

303
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,800
 how much fun he is, and how you hang with me,

304
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,000
 it's gonna go well for you, so let's party.

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,420
 And for six months, they throw a party.

306
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,000
 At the end of that six months, he sends everybody home,

307
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,880
 and he's like, man, I just like threw a huge party,

308
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,560
 and this city hosted thousands of people

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,660
 that came in from out of town.

310
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,480
 Let's throw a local party just for the city here,

311
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,780
 not for six months, but for seven days.

312
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,500
 So he throws this seven-day party,

313
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
 and at the end of the seven days, here's what happened.

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,280
 Oh, and during that seven days,

315
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,060
 there was only one rule, verse eight.

316
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,160
 By edict of the king, so this is the only rule

317
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,740
 for that feast, no limits were placed on drinking.

318
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,640
 So it is an open bar, you can have as much as you want,

319
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,180
 don't listen to anybody who tells you

320
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,680
 I think you've had enough.

321
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,880
 For the king had instructed all of his palace officials

322
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,200
 to serve each man as much as he wanted.

323
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,160
 This is not something the Bible is encouraging,

324
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
 it is just telling you what happened.

325
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,920
 (congregation laughing)

326
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,920
 At the same time, Queen Vashti, so there's his queen,

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,680
 not Esther, at this point, Vashti,

328
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,360
 was giving a banquet for all the women

329
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,480
 in the royal palace of King Xerxes.

330
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,760
 On the seventh day of the feast,

331
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,380
 when King Xerxes was high in spirits because of the wine,

332
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,760
 which is a nice way of saying he was drunk,

333
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,320
 he told the seven eunuchs,

334
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,480
 a eunuch is the most unfortunate character in this story.

335
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,520
 Eunuch was somebody who the king castrated

336
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,400
 to watch over his women.

337
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's a bad day when that happens,

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,960
 but he had seven eunuchs,

339
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,520
 there were lots of eunuchs throughout the story,

340
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,520
 and he says to seven eunuchs who attended him,

341
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,480
 Mehumane, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha,

342
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,160
 Zethar, and Carcas, who I'm just reading their names

343
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,840
 'cause they need some dignity here,

344
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,840
 and to bring Queen Vashti to him

345
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,600
 with the royal crown on her head.

346
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
 He wanted all the nobles and all the other men

347
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,860
 to gaze on her beauty, for she was a beautiful woman.

348
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,520
 But when they conveyed the king's order to Queen Vashti,

349
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,420
 she refused to come.

350
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,320
 This made the king furious, and he burned with anger.

351
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,540
 So seven-day party's going on,

352
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,880
 he's hanging out with all of his boys,

353
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,360
 and he begins to do what guys do

354
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
 whenever they had too much to drink,

355
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,200
 and they begin to talk dumb.

356
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,280
 And so he's like, hey, dude,

357
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
 have you seen how hot my wife is?

358
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,840
 Have you, dude, she's the hottest wife around.

359
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,260
 You think Karl's wife is hotter than my wife?

360
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,100
 You kidding me?

361
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,360
 No, my wife is the hottest.

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,120
 Hey, somebody go get my wife right now

363
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,160
 and tell her to come in here.

364
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,040
 And scholars believe that when he said that,

365
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
 he wanted to show off her figure and beauty,

366
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,280
 and so when he says, "And tell her to come wearing the crown,"

367
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,120
 it may have been the reason she said no,

368
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,160
 because he said, "Tell her to come wearing only the crown."

369
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,820
 Again, this guy's not a good dude,

370
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,360
 but she basically responds and says,

371
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
 "No," the king gets furious,

372
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
 and so then he's left with a problem of,

373
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,720
 man, you just embarrassed me in front of all of my boys here,

374
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,400
 and so he turns to the young men around him,

375
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,880
 and he's like, what should we do?

376
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,600
 And then it's like this big frat party going together,

377
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,880
 like, get rid of her, she's not good enough anyways.

378
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,080
 And so he's like, that's fine, let's get rid of her.

379
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,800
 When they conveyed, oh, I'm sorry,

380
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
 so if it pleased the king,

381
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,000
 we suggest that you issue a written decree, verse 19,

382
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,160
 a law of the Persians and the Medes that cannot be revoked.

383
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 It should order that Queen Vashti be forever banished

384
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,040
 from the presence of the king, Xerxes,

385
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,320
 and that the king should choose another queen

386
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,460
 more worthy than she, chapter two, verse one.

387
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,400
 But after Xerxes' anger had subsided,

388
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,000
 he began to think about Vashti.

389
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,640
 So he follows their instructions, gets rid of her,

390
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,960
 I'm gonna find a new king,

391
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
 and then he finally calms down

392
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,840
 and kind of wakes up the next day,

393
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,160
 not hungover, and he realizes he just made a law

394
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,760
 that he can't reverse,

395
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,420
 that he's no longer married to this woman,

396
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,560
 and he's like, but I need a queen, I need a girl.

397
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,220
 And he begins to think about her,

398
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,840
 and his boys around him know that,

399
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,280
 so his young men around him, verse two, suggested,

400
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,240
 let us search the empire

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,780
 to find beautiful young virgins for the king.

402
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,160
 Let the king appoint agents in each province,

403
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
 so each of the 127 provinces,

404
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,000
 to bring these beautiful young women

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
 into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa.

406
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,040
 Hegai, the king's eunuch, in charge of the harem,

407
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,080
 will see that they're all given beauty treatments.

408
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,320
 After that, the young woman who most pleases the king

409
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,920
 will be made queen instead of Vashti.

410
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
 This advice was very appealing to the king,

411
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,880
 so he put the plan into effect.

412
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 This is crazy that this is in the Bible.

413
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
 You see what just happened?

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,640
 These guys were like, young, dumb,

415
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,800
 drinking too much, guys doing,

416
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,640
 they're like, you know what we need?

417
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
 We need some chicks right now, that's what we need.

418
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,200
 And so here's what we should do.

419
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,600
 We should do like the bachelor Persia

420
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,160
 meets Miss Persia competition,

421
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,700
 and we're gonna go to all the provinces,

422
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,560
 get the most beautiful women that there are,

423
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
 we're gonna take 'em, we're gonna bring 'em here,

424
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,680
 make 'em beautiful for a year, we were told, later,

425
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,840
 and we're gonna come together,

426
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,560
 and they're gonna sleep with the king,

427
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,760
 and whichever one the king wants to sleep with,

428
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
 that can be his wife.

429
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,960
 Again, this is not something that the Bible's encouraging.

430
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,680
 It's a really terrible, like at this point,

431
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,800
 if you're reading it, especially as a dad reading this,

432
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 you're like, oh no, uh-uh.

433
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,520
 I'm like, this feels like the time, God,

434
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,200
 where you should show up and kill somebody.

435
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,040
 You did it earlier in the Bible.

436
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,480
 Why don't we do that right here?

437
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,960
 And because it's just like, this is not a good dude.

438
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,280
 Not surrounded by good dudes, it's not condoning it,

439
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,720
 but it's telling us the path of which the story

440
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
 that we're about to see came about.

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,820
 And so they go, they gather, and they get together,

442
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,400
 all these different women, we're told by a historian

443
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,440
 at the time that it was 400 women

444
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
 that they bring in to the king's harem.

445
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,280
 And then there's a scene change as they're collecting

446
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,120
 and gathering these women, and it says this.

447
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,040
 So inside of the movie, there's a scene change.

448
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,520
 We're introduced to our next character, Uncle Jesse.

449
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,800
 At that time, there was a Jewish man

450
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,820
 in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai,

451
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,160
 son of Jer.

452
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,800
 He was from the tribe of Benjamin.

453
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,360
 He was a descendant of Kish and Shime.

454
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,280
 His family had been among those that King Jehoiachin

455
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,800
 of Judah had been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon

456
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,780
 by King Nebuchadnezzar.

457
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,800
 So it's just pointing out the fact

458
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,760
 that he was among those exiled,

459
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,880
 and though he was released to go back to Jerusalem,

460
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,120
 he and the next woman we're introduced to

461
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,640
 stayed in that city.

462
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,280
 This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin,

463
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,240
 Hadassah, who was also called Esther.

464
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,640
 When her father and mother died,

465
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,280
 Mordecai adopted her into his family

466
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,420
 and raised her as his own daughter.

467
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,640
 So we're told a couple things about Esther.

468
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
 One, she was an orphan.

469
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
 Two, she had two names.

470
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,360
 She had a Jewish name and a Persian name, Hadassah and Esther.

471
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
 As a result of the king's decree,

472
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
 Esther, along with many other women,

473
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,880
 were brought into the king's harem at the fortress of Susa

474
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 and placed into Haggai's care.

475
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,280
 Haggai is like the Chris Harrison of this story

476
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,720
 from "The Bachelor," if you know who that is.

477
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,040
 He's like the dude who's like, "Bring all the ladies here.

478
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,440
 "Sir, I'll get them ready for you,

479
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,360
 "and you can decide from there."

480
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,420
 Again, I just lost all of the guys on there,

481
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,000
 but he is the one who's over, again, he's a eunuch,

482
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,640
 and he's over preparing and making sure

483
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,800
 all of these guys are ready.

484
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,480
 And we're told something happened

485
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,200
 in his interactions with Esther and him.

486
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,400
 Verse nine, "Haggai was very impressed with Esther."

487
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,920
 Your translation may say,

488
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,080
 "Esther found favor in Haggai's eyes,

489
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,160
 "and he treated her kindly.

490
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
 "He quickly ordered a special menu for her,

491
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,280
 "provided her with beauty treatments,

492
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,240
 "and he also assigned seven maids,

493
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,360
 "specially chosen from the king's palace,

494
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
 "and he moved her and her maids

495
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,200
 "into the best place in the harem."

496
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,040
 She's given special treatment and special favor

497
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,480
 from this guy who's overseeing her.

498
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,600
 "Esther had not told anyone of her nationality,

499
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,560
 "that she was Jewish, and family background,

500
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,680
 "because Mordecai had directed her not to do so."

501
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,520
 That Mordecai was afraid her Jewish faith

502
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,840
 may hurt her chances or just impact what happens to her,

503
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,960
 and so he says, "Don't share your faith with anyone."

504
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
 Verse 12, "Then we're told from the author

505
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,600
 "the rules of the competition

506
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,040
 "that they're about to be a part of.

507
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,480
 "Before each young woman was taken to the king's bed,"

508
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,200
 this dude is such a dirtbag,

509
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,180
 "she was prescribed 12 months of beauty treatments,

510
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,200
 "six months of oil of myrrh,

511
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,400
 "followed by six months of special perfumes and ointments.

512
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,080
 "When it was time for her to go to the king's palace,

513
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,000
 "she was given a choice of whatever clothing

514
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,440
 "or jewelry she wants she wanted to take from the harem.

515
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,040
 "That evening, she was taken into the king's private rooms.

516
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,400
 "The next morning, she was brought out to the second harem

517
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
 "where the king's wives lived.

518
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,480
 "There she would be under the care of Shehagaz,"

519
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,200
 like a first century rapper, "the king's eunuch,

520
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,080
 "in charge of the concubines.

521
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,360
 "She would never go to the king again

522
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,380
 "unless he had especially enjoyed her

523
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,160
 "and requested her by name."

524
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,780
 So anyone in the competition,

525
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,220
 here's what the future you have.

526
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,000
 You either win and you're queen,

527
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,600
 or you spend the rest of your life either as a concubine

528
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,060
 that has no interaction with the king maybe,

529
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,060
 or he calls you whenever he essentially wants a booty call,

530
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,140
 and that's the path you're gonna have.

531
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,680
 You can never marry anybody else.

532
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,100
 It was a law that you sleep with the king.

533
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,580
 You don't get to marry anybody else.

534
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,940
 And yet the king decides,

535
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,820
 "I'm gonna do whatever I want whenever I want,"

536
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,500
 and Esther is taken.

537
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,600
 We're told that she's taken.

538
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,700
 In other words, it likely wasn't that she volunteered

539
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,140
 to be a part of this, but she was taken

540
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,520
 and was made as a part of these women.

541
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,360
 Esther was taken to the king after a year of preparation.

542
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,820
 I don't know if that excites the girls in this room.

543
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,380
 You get to go to the spa for a year,

544
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
 or if that feels like you're getting ready

545
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,300
 to be a bridesmaid for a year

546
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,460
 with people like messing with your hair and getting makeup,

547
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,780
 but it's some mixture of the two of those that's taking place

548
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,780
 and after a year of that, Esther's ready and it says this.

549
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,380
 "She was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace

550
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,540
 "in early winter of the seventh year of his reign,

551
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,060
 "and the king loved Esther

552
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,680
 "more than any of the other young women.

553
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
 "He was so delighted with her

554
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,180
 "that he set the royal crown on her head

555
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,780
 "and he declared her queen instead of Vashti."

556
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,100
 So she goes in, sleeps with the king,

557
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,940
 and God turns the heart of the king

558
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,780
 to love her more than anybody else.

559
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,460
 He says, "The competition is over.

560
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,180
 "I found the girl, Queen Esther."

561
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,480
 Puts the crown on her head.

562
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,380
 She's declared the queen.

563
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,560
 It's a crazy story.

564
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,580
 It's a story that it looks like anything

565
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,780
 but God being at work.

566
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,700
 And yet, when you look and you see

567
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,660
 all the different ways that God was clearly

568
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,420
 turning people's hearts, positioning people

569
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,140
 in specific places, he was clearly at work

570
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,180
 because here's what just happened.

571
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,260
 Esther was just placed to the position of queen

572
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,600
 and she's now in prime placement

573
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,380
 to become the savior of the nation

574
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,540
 and that's gonna happen in a few chapters later.

575
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,020
 It's the ultimate rags to riches

576
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,820
 where she goes from riffraff street rat

577
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,500
 to now she's in the palace

578
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,460
 and she is at the right hand of the king.

579
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,780
 In the midst of all this, God clearly is at work

580
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,140
 and the book was written so that the people of Israel

581
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,620
 would know even when it seems chaotic and out of control,

582
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,460
 you can know that God is at work.

583
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,980
 The first thing I just wanna talk about

584
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,180
 that we learned from this passage

585
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,100
 is that God is at work even when it looks like he's not.

586
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,280
 God is at work even when it looks like he's not.

587
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,460
 Not just when it kinda looks like God's at work always,

588
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,100
 when it looks like this doesn't feel

589
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,620
 like anybody's at the wheel.

590
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,700
 God is absolutely at the wheel

591
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,580
 and he's moving the pieces around

592
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,660
 and he's bringing about his purposes

593
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,900
 in spite of people who don't know him,

594
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,460
 don't work with him, don't live

595
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,540
 in the direction that he's called people to live.

596
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,740
 This would look, I mean think about the story.

597
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,100
 There's a king, he gets drunk, he decides like,

598
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,780
 hey, I want my wife to come in here

599
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,460
 and dance around for us a little bit and she won't.

600
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,380
 He's like, screw you and then he does a beauty contest

601
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,260
 and 400 people come and this drunk, anger king

602
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,040
 ends up marrying this Jewish girl

603
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,800
 who sleeps with him and has sex with him

604
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,460
 before they got married and she marries a non-believer.

605
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,060
 It's not the type of scenario where if it happened today

606
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,140
 where people would be like,

607
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,700
 dude, that's clearly a God thing, wow.

608
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,060
 This is synonymous with like Monica Lewinsky,

609
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,420
 Bill Clinton thing where people are like,

610
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,980
 dude, that feels like an answer prayer to me, huh?

611
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,540
 It's like, what?

612
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,140
 And yet, God was clearly at work

613
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,340
 that he brings about in despite all the ways

614
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,180
 that this king was not living in a way

615
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,060
 that God would condone, God was clearly saying,

616
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,300
 I'm gonna move all of these things around for my purposes

617
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,940
 because I'm always at work even when it looks like I'm not.

618
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,340
 God is working through and in the midst of,

619
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,140
 at a high level and in the details

620
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,540
 of each one of our lives.

621
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,640
 Like he's in control no matter what's taking place

622
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
 in the world around us.

623
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,060
 He's at work even when it looks like he's not.

624
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,820
 It's the message or one of the big themes

625
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,540
 of the first two chapters.

626
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,060
 He's at work through every authority

627
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,800
 that's been placed in our world,

628
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,580
 whether that's in terms of whoever, you know,

629
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,940
 primaries today, whoever's elected president,

630
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,700
 whoever's ever in the Senate, a leader of a foreign nation,

631
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,500
 he's over and moving all of those.

632
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,860
 He's over all of them and he's at work

633
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,380
 and he's bringing about his purposes

634
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,260
 even when it doesn't seem like it

635
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,900
 or even when we can't see it, scripture says.

636
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,620
 Romans chapter 13 says that every authority

637
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,620
 has been established by God, both good and bad.

638
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,020
 Romans chapter 13, verse one and two says,

639
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,780
 for all authority comes from God.

640
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,140
 Think about this.

641
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,980
 Those in positions of authority

642
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,780
 have been placed there by God.

643
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,880
 Anyone who rebels against authority

644
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,740
 is rebelling against what God has instituted

645
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,980
 and they will be punished.

646
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,860
 Did you just say that every authority,

647
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,540
 like my boss who's a total jerk,

648
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,180
 was placed there by God?

649
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,020
 Yes.

650
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,260
 The president who sits in the White House right now

651
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,280
 was placed there by God.

652
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,060
 The president who will sit there in 12 months

653
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,400
 is placed there by God.

654
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,820
 Is God always in fan of every single action

655
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,020
 that every president has ever done?

656
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,780
 No, but he's over and he uses all of that

657
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,500
 in every shortcoming because there hasn't ever been

658
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,260
 any perfect president and there hasn't ever been

659
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,120
 any perfect leader anywhere.

660
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,860
 And yet he's over and moving all the different pieces around

661
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,540
 for his purposes to take place.

662
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,180
 Is the Bible saying that hey, if my authority,

663
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,180
 my boss, someone over me is asking me

664
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,900
 to do something that is sin or contradicts God's word,

665
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,040
 I need to do it?

666
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,880
 No.

667
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,660
 Because then there's a higher authority involved

668
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,500
 which is God.

669
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,260
 And we have to decide or have to say,

670
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,580
 hey, look, you're asking me to go to strip club for work

671
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,780
 and you're just saying that's what you do?

672
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,620
 That's not what I do.

673
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
 That's not what I think is right

674
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,780
 and I can't do that because of my faith.

675
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,300
 And so if that means I lose my job, that's okay.

676
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,120
 I trust you.

677
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,420
 I trust God.

678
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,500
 And this is that, but every authority,

679
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,480
 it says all of it, he's moving all of the different pieces

680
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,900
 around.

681
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,300
 God's at work even when we can't see it

682
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,140
 to bring about things.

683
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,140
 And sometimes you just see how despite tragic things

684
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,060
 that happen that God didn't cause,

685
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,020
 he's clearly a part of it

686
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,540
 or he clearly brings about good in spite of it.

687
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,580
 Like you guys know the Holocaust

688
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,420
 which happened in World War II

689
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,900
 and just the tragic atrocities happening

690
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,380
 that happened through the Holocaust

691
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,020
 of millions of Jewish people losing lives.

692
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,660
 You know one of the things that was a clear fulfillment

693
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,060
 of prophecy that happened after that?

694
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,300
 The nation of Israel was given a land,

695
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,340
 a location.

696
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,780
 In other words, as a result of that,

697
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,740
 nations got together and were like,

698
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,920
 we should give these guys a place they can go to

699
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,420
 and gather and the nation of Israel was formed

700
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,940
 after hundreds and hundreds of years

701
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,180
 of not having a nation.

702
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,020
 I don't know if you know that.

703
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,380
 It's not like it's, look up Israel 1938.

704
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,300
 Doesn't exist.

705
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,180
 Happened after World War II.

706
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,060
 And despite all of the horrificness of that,

707
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,640
 God moved the things around and he fulfills a prophecy

708
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,960
 that they would be established having a land

709
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,260
 and he brings that about.

710
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,900
 In the midst of all the different evil,

711
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,620
 'cause you can be left with a question

712
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,220
 of like God's work when it doesn't look like it,

713
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,320
 why doesn't he step in and stop more evil in our world?

714
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,960
 Stop more suffering that takes place?

715
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,580
 Like why doesn't he stop school shootings

716
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,780
 or terrorism or viruses outbreaking?

717
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,980
 And to that I would say,

718
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,280
 how do you know he's not all the time?

719
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,240
 Every single moment that there isn't an outbreak

720
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,260
 of utter evil is because God holds it back at bay

721
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,780
 in a world that's full of evil and brokenness and chaos.

722
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,500
 At every moment there's not a school shooting

723
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
 is a moment he stopped it.

724
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,300
 And every moment there's not a virus

725
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,820
 that's exploding and breaking out

726
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,560
 is a moment he stopped it.

727
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,300
 And yet in his sovereign will,

728
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,720
 there's times where it allows,

729
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,820
 but we're not told why we are told that he will

730
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,660
 allow even the worst of circumstances to be used

731
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,500
 and brought about for good.

732
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,220
 And I don't know how he's gonna do all of that

733
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,140
 with certain things, just to be candid.

734
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,580
 And any answer I would give you right now,

735
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,460
 it's not gonna satisfy you.

736
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,500
 Certainly it doesn't satisfy me.

737
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,900
 How do you reconcile sexual abuse, God?

738
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,460
 How is that a part of your sovereign plan?

739
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,620
 Why would you even allow that?

740
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,700
 And I don't know.

741
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,540
 You know, the divorce that has ripped apart my family's home

742
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,380
 and my family and just all of the different pain

743
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,220
 that was caused as a result of my father having an affair

744
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,100
 or whatever your story is,

745
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,180
 how do you reconcile and make that good, God?

746
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,220
 And I don't know.

747
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,040
 But we're told in Ecclesiastes chapter three,

748
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,920
 even the worst of things, verse 11,

749
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,600
 God will make beautiful in its time, everything.

750
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,200
 There's gonna come a day and a moment where you look

751
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,220
 and the worst and most broken things that he allowed,

752
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
 he didn't cause.

753
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,280
 But when you were the victim

754
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,560
 of some painful moments like that,

755
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,860
 I don't even know that the difference matters.

756
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,680
 'Cause it still happened.

757
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,360
 And we're not told how,

758
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,280
 we are told that when everything is made new,

759
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,960
 there's gonna come a moment where make everything beautiful

760
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,480
 and woven together in its time,

761
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,320
 even the worst of things that you experience.

762
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
 It's like this.

763
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,420
 Here's a bunch of random kind of ingredients

764
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,320
 that are up here that in and of themselves

765
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,600
 are no one would want to eat.

766
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,880
 Like this is a bunch of flour.

767
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,240
 Like you wouldn't want to eat a cup of flour

768
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,800
 unless you're on Fear Factor

769
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,240
 and there's money on the line or something.

770
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,880
 Or like butter unless you're just doing

771
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,000
 some bulletproof coffee.

772
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,120
 Or eggs, no one wants to go eat eggs

773
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,320
 unless you're a guest on or like a Uber CrossFit guy in here.

774
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,880
 Or vanilla, like things that in and of themselves,

775
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
 you're like, man, did I lose a bet I have to eat that stuff?

776
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,900
 That doesn't taste good at all.

777
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,800
 What's crazy is when you take all those different things

778
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
 and you put them together in the hands of a baker,

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,840
 you make something that just made people be like, ooh.

780
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
 That tastes amazing.

781
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,360
 These things that in and of themselves,

782
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,200
 they don't taste good at all.

783
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,760
 Like you couldn't pay me to eat that.

784
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,700
 And then you put them in the hands of somebody

785
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,200
 who's a gifted baker and they make something

786
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,840
 that tastes delicious out of it.

787
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,520
 That's what the scripture says.

788
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,200
 Whether you believe it or not, that's what it says.

789
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,960
 That hey, there's gonna come moments where it's like,

790
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,400
 dude, this is flour.

791
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,040
 This is, what I'm walking through right now

792
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,200
 does not taste right.

793
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,920
 But it promises that God, there's gonna come a moment

794
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,040
 where he makes everything beautiful in its time

795
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,400
 and all of it woven together for good, for yours and mine.

796
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,200
 If you know and love God, it promises.

797
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,040
 And even when it doesn't look like he's working, he is.

798
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,680
 Second thing that we see in this text

799
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,760
 is that God is at work in the details.

800
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,200
 God is at work in the details of life.

801
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,760
 That God is bringing about his plans and his purposes

802
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,400
 through the details of her life and your life.

803
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,840
 You think about her, she's in the city of Susa,

804
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,720
 which is not like any other,

805
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,540
 she could have been in any city in the kingdom.

806
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,440
 She finds herself in the capital city.

807
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,920
 She's worked through her beauty, the way that she was made,

808
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,200
 like the way that she was formed and put together.

809
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,000
 God was sovereign and he was over all of that

810
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
 and weaving it together.

811
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,520
 He was over Haggai, the name of Chris Harrison,

812
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
 having favor with her.

813
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,360
 He was over the king having favor with her.

814
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,240
 And he is over the details of your life.

815
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,400
 He is at work, he's bringing it about,

816
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
 and he's sovereign over the things

817
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,560
 that are taking place inside of your life.

818
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,760
 We're told in the scripture that he's sovereign

819
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,320
 over how you are made.

820
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,740
 That's the color of your skin, the way that you look,

821
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,800
 that he formed everything about you,

822
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,300
 the personality that you have.

823
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,400
 In Psalm 139, verse 13, it says,

824
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,200
 "God created and knit you together in your mother's womb.

825
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,520
 "I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made."

826
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,640
 Matthew chapter 10, verse 29 says,

827
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,920
 "Even the hairs of your head are numbered."

828
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,860
 Think about that.

829
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,000
 Every hair on your head, numbered.

830
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,240
 That's the level of detail to which God knows you.

831
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,400
 We're told that he's sovereign over the places

832
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,240
 that you live.

833
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,020
 Proverbs chapter 16, verses eight and nine says,

834
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,180
 "We make our plans, but the Lord directs our steps."

835
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,380
 Like you think it's random you live in Dallas,

836
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,320
 or you think it's like a curse you live in Dallas,

837
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,400
 or I don't know what you think,

838
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
 wherever you live that you're listening in.

839
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,980
 Like you think like, oh man, it's just,

840
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,560
 I didn't even get the job that I wanted to,

841
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,720
 and I wanted to be in Atlanta.

842
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,880
 That's where all my friends ended up,

843
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,720
 and the only job that I got was in Dallas,

844
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
 and so that's why I'm here.

845
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,760
 It's not because I wanna be here,

846
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,840
 'cause God was like, oh, go to Dallas.

847
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,020
 That's why I'm here.

848
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,200
 And the truth is, it's not random.

849
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,280
 He's in the details, and he has you here.

850
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,560
 He even has you in this room for a purpose,

851
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,360
 and he's intimately at work in the details

852
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,440
 of your life, of my life,

853
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,660
 just like he was in the story of Esther.

854
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,080
 He's at work in where you worked today,

855
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,680
 or the career that you have.

856
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
 Like God is over all those things.

857
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 They are not random, biblically speaking.

858
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,080
 They're part of a plan that he's unfolding.

859
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,840
 I was at a restaurant in town called Taco Cinco,

860
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,240
 which I think is the best chips and salsa in Dallas.

861
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,340
 I'm gonna go on record.

862
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,140
 I know that's crazy, and I'm probably gonna get more emails

863
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,320
 about that comment right there

864
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,840
 than anything else that I say.

865
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,300
 (congregation laughing)

866
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,960
 But I was in there, and I was with a friend.

867
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,240
 We were eating lunch, and talking to the waitress.

868
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,280
 She came up, and she was serving us.

869
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,100
 Her name was Sarah.

870
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,080
 I began to ask Sarah, "Where are you from?"

871
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,340
 and just kind of walked through,

872
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,640
 just getting to visit with her a little bit.

873
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,880
 And then at some point, I asked her,

874
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,000
 "Hey, what do you know about the name Sarah?"

875
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,840
 And she said, "I know it's Persian for princess."

876
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,520
 And I said, "It does mean princess.

877
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,200
 "Do you know where your name comes from?"

878
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,760
 And she was like, "Persia?"

879
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,520
 And I was like, "It's from a book, actually, the Bible."

880
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,900
 And she said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's in the Bible."

881
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,840
 And I said, "What do you know about the story of Sarah?"

882
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,660
 And I walked her through.

883
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,160
 She was a part of this covenant relationship

884
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,720
 that God had with the people at that time

885
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,140
 through Abraham, her husband,

886
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,400
 and that Sarah was a part of that.

887
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,240
 And that covenant today has been fulfilled in Jesus,

888
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
 and that anybody who trusts not in how good of a person

889
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
 they are, how bad of a person they are,

890
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,480
 but in what Jesus did on the cross,

891
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,360
 dying for them, paying for their sin,

892
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,720
 once and fully and finally,

893
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,160
 everything wrong they've ever done, paid for,

894
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,500
 he died in their place, and he rose.

895
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,820
 He was buried and rose from the dead,

896
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,020
 showing the payment for the sin of all mankind

897
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,860
 was more than enough.

898
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,580
 If anyone trusts in that free gift, not in themselves,

899
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,480
 they're gonna have eternal life,

900
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,320
 and they're a part of that covenant people

901
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,640
 that God has invited all of us to be a part of.

902
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,520
 And I said something to her that is true.

903
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
 I said, "You know what's crazy, Sarah?"

904
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,120
 This is gonna sound weird, you're gonna think that's crazy,

905
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,120
 is I think God brought us here so that we could tell you that

906
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,480
 and we could tell you He hadn't forgotten you,

907
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
 He knows your name, He cares about you,

908
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,040
 and He loves you.

909
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,640
 Biblically, that is incredibly true, without question true.

910
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
 We're told in Acts chapter 17 that God appoints

911
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,260
 the boundaries and the times in which people live,

912
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,720
 the moments, all of them, He's moving the pieces around.

913
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
 And in that moment, He's saying,

914
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,020
 "Hey, I'm gonna bring you here to that person."

915
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,800
 And she looked at me and kinda had his face,

916
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,320
 and then I said, "Because we're angels."

917
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,680
 And no, I didn't say that at all.

918
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
 What if I did?

919
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,720
 (congregation laughing)

920
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,320
 And then just slowly vanished away.

921
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,200
 And no, that part didn't happen.

922
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
 But God's over it, He's over even that moment

923
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,920
 of who's gonna be at that table.

924
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,540
 And as God's people, we just have to have the eyes to see

925
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,680
 and to remember that He's moving the pieces all around,

926
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,960
 He's sovereign of the places they work,

927
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,440
 He's intimately at work in the details of your life.

928
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,120
 He's over even the fact that the king's heart chose her,

929
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,800
 that He wanted to have that relationship with her.

930
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,820
 The king, we're told, he falls in love with her,

931
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,180
 we're told in Proverbs 22, verse one, 21, verse one,

932
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,380
 "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord,

933
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,200
 like rivers of water, he turns it wherever he wishes."

934
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,520
 You know who's over the hearts of people around you,

935
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,280
 like your boss's perception of you,

936
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
 whatever he thinks about you?

937
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,740
 You know who's over more of that than you are,

938
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,940
 who has more control over that than you do?

939
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,180
 God.

940
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,340
 Whatever people's perception of you and the relationship

941
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,700
 and the way somebody feels towards you,

942
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,280
 you know who has more control over that than you do?

943
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
 God.

944
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,180
 More control over that than even they do?

945
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,020
 God.

946
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,880
 That He turns it and He's like, "Esther, she's your girl."

947
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,780
 And you can walk in a confidence knowing that,

948
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,960
 man, hey, I can either try to always be defending myself

949
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,920
 and always concerned about what other people think about me,

950
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,780
 or I can walk knowing that, hey, God,

951
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,760
 you know everything that they feel,

952
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
 you know everything that they think,

953
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,480
 I'm gonna trust you with the perceptions

954
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,600
 that others have of me.

955
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,500
 You're the king of hearts.

956
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,720
 And Esther experienced that king of hearts

957
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,720
 turning his heart because God is in the details.

958
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,880
 I remember there was a moment,

959
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,080
 and knowing that allows us to face things

960
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
 where it's like, it doesn't look like

961
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,160
 he's clearly doing that here.

962
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,480
 I remember when I was dating my wife

963
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
 and we were in college and we came to that moment,

964
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,080
 kind of like ring by spring, where you're like,

965
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,840
 hey, are we gonna move forward here or not?

966
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,500
 And we were at a place where we just weren't ready

967
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,800
 for the relationship to move forward.

968
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,580
 And so we broke up.

969
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,060
 And that was terrible.

970
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,080
 Every breakup is horrible.

971
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,840
 And we had dated well, relatively speaking.

972
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,240
 And it was brutal and it was painful.

973
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,840
 And we broke up for two years.

974
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,880
 And in those moments, when that was going down

975
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,560
 and happening, especially initially,

976
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,300
 it was so painful, like, God, what are you doing?

977
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,220
 We invested all this relational time.

978
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,000
 This is not something either of us wanted to experience,

979
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,120
 but we knew this is not the time to move forward

980
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,020
 and may never be.

981
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,240
 And two years went by and it became more of that time

982
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,520
 where God had the relationship move forward.

983
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,760
 But here's, despite the fact that I didn't want that

984
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,480
 to happen, I never would have thought that would be God

985
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,000
 a part of that, my faith in those two years

986
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,920
 that we were separated grew like it had never grown

987
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
 in my entire life.

988
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
 I just started working here.

989
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,400
 I was going to seminary and studying.

990
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,960
 And the way that God just got a hold of my heart

991
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,440
 was unique compared to all the other years I've lived.

992
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,520
 And I look back and I think that's some of the most

993
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,840
 developmental time I've ever had.

994
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,640
 And that God was in the midst of all of that.

995
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,720
 I don't know what you're walking through.

996
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,120
 I don't know what you're facing, but I do know

997
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,700
 that God is at work in the details of your life.

998
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,600
 And then finally, God is at work through imperfect people.

999
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,320
 God is at work through imperfect people.

1000
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,480
 The text, like this may surprise you.

1001
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,740
 Here's the challenge with Esther.

1002
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,000
 A lot of people come in and they're like, dude, Esther,

1003
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,400
 favorite girl in the whole Bible.

1004
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,560
 Like she's slay queen, she's the goals.

1005
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,240
 She's my favorite.

1006
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,040
 She's not in this chapter a great example of what to do.

1007
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,480
 Like truly, she's a girl.

1008
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,800
 No one would say this is a recipe for success.

1009
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,720
 You're gonna marry a non-believer, have sex with them

1010
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,160
 before you get married, along with like 400 other girls

1011
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,000
 that have sex with them.

1012
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,160
 And you're gonna end up living regardless in his house

1013
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,560
 and don't tell anybody about your faith.

1014
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,520
 And you probably should be in Jerusalem anyways.

1015
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,360
 She's not a recipe of someone to follow.

1016
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,880
 But despite all of that, God is at work

1017
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,220
 through imperfect people because he's always at work

1018
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,480
 through imperfect people.

1019
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,400
 How do we know that scripturally,

1020
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
 she wasn't supposed to have sex even in the Old Testament?

1021
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,060
 Exodus chapter 22 says that people, men and women, Esther,

1022
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,960
 was not to have sex before marriage.

1023
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,680
 Deuteronomy chapter seven, verse two and four

1024
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,480
 said that you were not to marry people

1025
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,900
 who did not worship the one true God, Yahweh.

1026
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,240
 Matthew chapter 10 talks about, hey,

1027
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,760
 anyone who does not acknowledge me before men,

1028
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
 I will not acknowledge.

1029
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,360
 So if you hide your faith, it's a reflection

1030
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,360
 of a weak faith that you're not to have.

1031
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:46,280
 What's challenging or what is maybe a result

1032
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,240
 that let me just clarify quickly

1033
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,560
 because in case that's shocking to you,

1034
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,780
 it's probably because of a couple things.

1035
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,880
 The first, let me just high level teach

1036
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
 like some of what the Bible is.

1037
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,840
 The Bible has things involved in it

1038
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,680
 that are stories that are descriptive

1039
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,160
 and then things that are prescriptive.

1040
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,000
 Prescriptive is like a prescription, do this.

1041
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,720
 Descriptive is like, this is what happened and it was crazy.

1042
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,160
 And that happens all throughout the Bible.

1043
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,040
 There's a lot of stories that are descriptive,

1044
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,880
 not prescriptive.

1045
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,480
 In other words, you should not do this type of thing.

1046
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,020
 And then there's commands that are prescriptive

1047
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,800
 that are instructions on how to live,

1048
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,260
 how to handle alcohol, sexuality, how to live your life,

1049
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,060
 care for your family, how you should bring up your kids.

1050
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,240
 Those are prescriptive.

1051
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,480
 This is a story that is descriptive inside of scripture.

1052
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,080
 The second thing that may clarify

1053
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,680
 why Esther is not a great example, at least in this chapter,

1054
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,540
 and she's not the good guy in this part of the story,

1055
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,920
 at least, is a fundamental misunderstanding

1056
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,760
 of what the Bible is.

1057
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,880
 So this is really important in case like you two me out

1058
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,960
 and you're counting these little wood things over here.

1059
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,000
 So come back.

1060
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,440
 A lot of you guys don't read the Bible right.

1061
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,000
 Like you don't understand what it actually is.

1062
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And I'm not trying to insult you, it's just true.

1063
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,780
 You think the Bible is a book that's a bunch of like,

1064
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,480
 hey, there's some good people and then there's some bad

1065
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,020
 people and you wanna try to be like the good people.

1066
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,340
 That's not what the Bible is.

1067
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,500
 The Bible is a bunch of bad guys

1068
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,620
 and one good guy named Jesus.

1069
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,320
 And the bad guys are so bad,

1070
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,760
 they kill the one good guy named Jesus.

1071
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,940
 And so Esther, just like every other person in the Bible,

1072
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,380
 is not one of the good guys.

1073
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,600
 She's one of the bad guys,

1074
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,180
 but God uses imperfect, broken bad guys.

1075
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,140
 And you may be going, what?

1076
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,980
 That's not true.

1077
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,800
 What about Noah?

1078
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,620
 He built that ark, got all those animals on there.

1079
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,660
 That was awesome.

1080
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,540
 Noah, after he got done with that ark,

1081
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,340
 found himself at sea, ended up being,

1082
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,700
 dry land came eventually.

1083
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,300
 You know one of the first things we're told about Noah

1084
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,660
 whenever he got off that ark?

1085
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,420
 He built a vineyard and got hammered

1086
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,380
 and he walked around naked and his kids were like,

1087
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,680
 dad, this is gross.

1088
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,820
 Oh my gosh.

1089
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,980
 That's in the Bible.

1090
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,220
 That's Noah.

1091
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,620
 Abraham, let's go to the next one.

1092
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,580
 Abraham, Abraham pimps out his wife two different times.

1093
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,820
 In other words, he's like, hey,

1094
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,780
 I think they're gonna kill me if I say you're my wife

1095
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,440
 'cause you're a looker and they may end up

1096
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,120
 wanting to take you so they'll kill me.

1097
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,760
 So let's just say you're my sister.

1098
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,520
 And his sister ends up being taken in the room of a king.

1099
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,560
 Two different times, the same exact story happened.

1100
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,780
 Then he sleeps with the maid and gets her pregnant.

1101
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,160
 Is that a guy that you're like,

1102
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,240
 that's my hero right there.

1103
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,360
 That's what I'm talking about.

1104
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,360
 King David, King David, man after God's own heart.

1105
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,440
 Slay Goliath, lots of good things.

1106
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,120
 He's a guy who has an affair,

1107
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,480
 convinced adultery with one of his closest friends' wives.

1108
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,400
 And then she gets pregnant and he's like, okay.

1109
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,840
 And he can't get him, his friend to come home

1110
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,100
 to make it look like she got her pregnant

1111
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,420
 so he just kills his friend.

1112
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,960
 And then you're like, yeah, everyone has a bad day.

1113
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,040
 (congregation laughing)

1114
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,300
 Let's go with that, okay.

1115
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,060
 From his deathbed, King David from his deathbed.

1116
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,920
 You know what he asks his son to do?

1117
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,880
 He puts out a hit on another guy's life.

1118
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,360
 He's like, yeah, and by the way, I'm about to die.

1119
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,700
 And I think you should kill that guy.

1120
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,200
 That's a part of 1 Kings chapter two.

1121
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,200
 But David, as he's dying, puts a hit out like a mafia boss.

1122
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,880
 It's not a bunch of stories about good guy and good guys

1123
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,120
 and try to be like good guys.

1124
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,120
 It's a story of a bunch of broken, messed up people.

1125
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,400
 And God is the hero in the midst of the story.

1126
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,800
 And Esther is no different.

1127
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,920
 What Esther, 'cause the interpretive challenge is then,

1128
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,200
 dude, well, you can do whatever you want.

1129
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
 You can sleep before marriage, marry whoever you want,

1130
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,360
 and God can still use it to bring you about good.

1131
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,200
 Two problems with that.

1132
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,500
 One is that all of us are accountable for what you know.

1133
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,480
 We don't know what Esther knew.

1134
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,000
 We don't know if she had access to Old Testament Bible.

1135
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,520
 We don't know what she knew.

1136
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,660
 But if you're in this room tonight,

1137
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,280
 you've been exposed to the truth

1138
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,780
 that God in the scriptures has called us

1139
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,620
 to date in certain ways, live in certain ways,

1140
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,400
 marry certain people, believers,

1141
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
 who share that same faith as you.

1142
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,400
 James chapter four, verse seven says,

1143
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
 "He who knows the right thing to do

1144
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,460
 and does not do it for him, it is sin."

1145
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,360
 We do not know exactly all that Esther knew,

1146
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,660
 but we know what you know.

1147
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,560
 The second thing is in Esther doing that,

1148
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,000
 she forfeited a story that could have showcased

1149
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,600
 God working with people who follow his will

1150
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,800
 in an incredible way.

1151
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,920
 In other words, we wouldn't be sitting here

1152
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,960
 2,500 years later going, hey,

1153
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,240
 and this is not exactly a great example to follow here.

1154
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,080
 God can redeem anything,

1155
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,100
 but this is not a recipe for success.

1156
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,480
 We would be sitting here going, wow, look at her courage.

1157
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,000
 Had she gone in and the king and said,

1158
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,560
 hey, you took me away from my family,

1159
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,800
 but I'm not gonna have sex with you

1160
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,020
 because I believe that sex is for marriage,

1161
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,840
 so I'm gonna sleep with my husband.

1162
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,280
 Let's say the king didn't kill her there,

1163
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,200
 and he's like, all right, man, feisty.

1164
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,080
 Want what you can't have?

1165
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,280
 Let's get married.

1166
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,820
 And if she looked at him and said,

1167
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,200
 no, I can only marry people who worship the one true God,

1168
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
 maybe he would have said, get out of here, go home.

1169
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,120
 That's an exciting story.

1170
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,020
 Maybe he would have said, tell me more.

1171
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,120
 Maybe he would have converted to Judaism

1172
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,400
 and worshiped the one true God.

1173
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,200
 We have no idea.

1174
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,600
 You know what happens when a king converts,

1175
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
 a nation converts.

1176
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,960
 It could have been an entirely different story,

1177
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,080
 and she forfeited seeing God show up

1178
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,960
 and be faithful to his promises and his people

1179
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,100
 by her being obedient and faithful to him.

1180
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,640
 Many of you are gonna forfeit

1181
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,960
 seeing God show up in your life,

1182
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,040
 just like Esther did,

1183
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,940
 because you're not actually willing to be obedient,

1184
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,880
 and you're not gonna see him work.

1185
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,880
 Two people came down in the last couple weeks,

1186
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,080
 different stories in both their lives,

1187
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,680
 but they were in a similar circumstance.

1188
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,960
 One was in a situation where they're like,

1189
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,000
 hey, I'm living with my boyfriend.

1190
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,280
 I just don't know what to do.

1191
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,120
 You know, we've been talking about

1192
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,380
 how that's not a great thing,

1193
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,120
 but I feel like maybe I should move out.

1194
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,800
 The exact same story with somebody else was taking place.

1195
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,680
 Both of them came down.

1196
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,600
 One of them, and they both had hearts that were like,

1197
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,960
 I think maybe I shouldn't be living with him.

1198
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,800
 Will you pray for me?

1199
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,620
 I'm scared.

1200
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,600
 I became a Christian,

1201
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,320
 and I think I need to move out.

1202
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,020
 Both of them were in that same place.

1203
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,320
 One of them decided to actually act on that,

1204
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,920
 and the other one decided to say,

1205
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,120
 I know God says that's what I should do,

1206
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,400
 but I don't care,

1207
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,280
 and I'm just gonna try to look the other way.

1208
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,800
 And you know what she forfeited?

1209
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
 One, marrying a godly husband,

1210
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,580
 and two, at least being in that search,

1211
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,120
 if she doesn't change the direction of her dating scenario

1212
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,220
 of continuing to live with a guy,

1213
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,840
 and two, she forfeited seeing God show up.

1214
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,040
 And the other girl decided,

1215
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,320
 hey, I'm gonna do it, and I'm scared,

1216
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,600
 and I've lived with him two and a half years,

1217
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,000
 but I'm gonna make the decision to move out.

1218
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,120
 And she saw God show up by the people of God coming around,

1219
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,320
 and God showed and provided a house,

1220
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,200
 that hey, you can come live in this bedroom.

1221
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,960
 She was concerned 'cause she didn't have a car,

1222
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,040
 and she had to walk to work,

1223
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,480
 and she was like, if I move to someplace else,

1224
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,360
 how am I gonna get to work?

1225
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,640
 And then all of a sudden, the people of God are like,

1226
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,000
 hey, you can use this car.

1227
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 And she got to see God at work

1228
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,120
 in the midst of her obedience.

1229
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,340
 When you and I forfeit and are disobedient

1230
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,180
 to following God's way,

1231
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,960
 you forfeit seeing God show up,

1232
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,300
 just like Esther in this story,

1233
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,600
 forfeit again to see God show up to save his people.

1234
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,380
 In conclusion, God is always at work,

1235
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,380
 even when it looks like he's not.

1236
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,140
 He's at work in the details of your life right now.

1237
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,460
 Who you are, the way that you look,

1238
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,860
 the place that you live, he's at work.

1239
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,620
 And God is at work and has always been at work

1240
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,820
 through imperfect people.

1241
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,780
 He is the hero of the book of Esther.

1242
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,820
 He's the hero of the story.

1243
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,880
 He's the hero of the entire Bible.

1244
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,960
 And the point of Christianity

1245
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,680
 is not how great any one of us is,

1246
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,940
 it's that we have found a savior hero named Jesus.

1247
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,400
 It's the point of Esther, it's the point of the whole story.

1248
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,960
 He's the solution.

1249
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,400
 He saves the queen.

1250
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,300
 And he's the savior of anyone who will trust in him.

1251
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,400
 Let me wrap up like this.

1252
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,620
 The crazy thing about the coronavirus thing,

1253
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,600
 which is really not that bad, just FYI,

1254
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,120
 in terms of symptoms and the flu is probably worse,

1255
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,860
 but now I'm gonna get an email on that

1256
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,460
 from somebody in the medical community.

1257
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,640
 Crazy thing about that, I think,

1258
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,820
 is that the contagiousness of it

1259
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,080
 and two weeks being dormant

1260
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,280
 where you can't tell if somebody has it

1261
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,620
 and just eventually the symptoms begin to pop up

1262
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,080
 and you can see the virus

1263
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,820
 that you can't see with the human eye,

1264
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,280
 but you can see the presence and evidence of it

1265
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,960
 showing up in somebody's life.

1266
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,300
 And just the ways that it even spreads from there.

1267
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,980
 And how much craziness and just people obsessed

1268
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,080
 about like, "Oh no, what are we gonna do?"

1269
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,060
 And we should do, should be wise

1270
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,340
 and use Lysol and all that stuff.

1271
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,900
 But there's a much more serious virus

1272
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,860
 that likewise has also infiltrated into the human race.

1273
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,820
 And it's a virus that you can see the evidence of it

1274
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,660
 all around us.

1275
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,940
 You can't always see the presence of it

1276
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,020
 like infecting someone,

1277
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,920
 but you can see the symptoms of the infection.

1278
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,420
 And that is a virus called SYN.

1279
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,940
 And unlike the virus of a coronavirus

1280
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,480
 that takes two and a hundred,

1281
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,080
 this is a virus that has killed 100 for 100 people.

1282
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,280
 And there is a solution for it,

1283
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,960
 but it is not some vaccine or some medical procedure.

1284
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,180
 It is a savior named Jesus.

1285
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,000
 What do I mean by like the symptoms of this virus

1286
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,840
 that comes in?

1287
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,340
 Like you can see, and even if you're not a Christian,

1288
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,280
 listen to me very closely.

1289
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,540
 You know there's messed up things in your life

1290
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,940
 and in the lives of people around you

1291
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,060
 that you were like, dude, that's probably not right.

1292
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,340
 You could see the evidence of the symptoms of this virus

1293
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,700
 that come in and they begin to infect somebody.

1294
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,420
 And that infection leads to them being addicted

1295
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,100
 to looking at naked pictures of men and women

1296
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,840
 on the internet having sex together.

1297
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,680
 Think about that.

1298
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,500
 All of a sudden they're like, man, I just can't stop

1299
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,820
 because of this virus has begun to infect.

1300
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,200
 The virus, sometimes you see the evidence

1301
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,900
 of like the infection in somebody's life

1302
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,980
 and that they eat food and then they purge it up

1303
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,380
 because they just hate the way that they look

1304
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,340
 and they're reaching for control

1305
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,900
 and they can't face this life

1306
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,380
 without having something they can control.

1307
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,980
 And it's because that infection,

1308
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,660
 those are just symptoms of the virus of sin that is there.

1309
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,780
 That virus is the reason why many of you like my home

1310
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,380
 was ripped apart through parents divorcing

1311
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,120
 because sin came in and you didn't see it exactly

1312
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,100
 all the way come in, but you saw the evidence of it

1313
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,060
 and the destruction take place.

1314
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,980
 Evidence of the virus you can see around us

1315
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,420
 in the ways that racial division still marks

1316
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,160
 so many people inside of our country.

1317
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,380
 Evidence of the virus in my life I can see

1318
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,980
 through sexual desires for people who are not my wife,

1319
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,100
 anger, greed that can mark my heart,

1320
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,520
 selfishness that doesn't care about people,

1321
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,940
 the way that God says I'm to care about people,

1322
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,420
 and it's all symptoms of the virus.

1323
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,260
 But here's the good news.

1324
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,420
 Unlike in that scenario with the coronavirus,

1325
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,060
 there isn't really a solution to the virus.

1326
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,220
 There is one for this.

1327
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:34,980
 And there's a solution to the symptoms in your life,

1328
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,020
 but it is not you trying harder or you reading some book.

1329
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,540
 It is you trusting in a savior.

1330
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,060
 And when you do that, that savior begins to promise

1331
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,940
 you will one day be delivered from the penalty of sin.

1332
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,100
 And that virus and the presence of sin

1333
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,020
 will one day forever be gone.

1334
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,340
 And this world will rise again,

1335
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,180
 just like Jesus rose from the dead and it will be healed.

1336
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,780
 And now you can begin to experience freedom

1337
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,740
 from the power of sin because the Holy Spirit

1338
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,140
 begins to come into your life and save and purge

1339
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,500
 everything that's hurting you from your life

1340
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,140
 and everything that's hurting me.

1341
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,620
 There is one savior, one hero, one solution

1342
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,500
 to the disease that is far more deadly

1343
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,540
 than anything our world has ever seen.

1344
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,220
 And many of you have never trusted in that.

1345
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,360
 And tragically, you think that you can save yourself.

1346
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,360
 You think that you can, through whatever you do,

1347
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,120
 earn a relationship with God and you have bought a lie.

1348
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,240
 And you feel like you need to clean yourself up

1349
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,480
 a little bit or get things together.

1350
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,240
 And then God, you know, work on your relationship

1351
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,520
 and you know, just read a little bit more Bible

1352
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,160
 and then you'll get there and you have bought a bunch of BS.

1353
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,520
 One of the greatest lies our world has bought

1354
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,800
 specifically in America is that good people go to heaven,

1355
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,900
 bad people go to hell.

1356
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,240
 Biblically, forgiven people go to heaven.

1357
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,540
 And there is one way to get forgiveness.

1358
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,800
 His name is Jesus.

1359
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,520
 Let me pray.

1360
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,620
 Father, thank you for the story of Esther.

1361
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:10,560
 It showcases when we can't see you, you're working.

1362
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,660
 You work in imperfect, broken people.

1363
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,800
 You bring about your purposes, nothing can thwart

1364
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,840
 your hand, your plans, your sovereign and your good.

1365
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,340
 And you invite us who know you to call you Father.

1366
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:29,720
 I pray for anyone tonight who's never trusted in Jesus.

1367
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,980
 This would be their night.

1368
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,860
 And the Savior of Esther would be the Savior of them.

1369
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:40,680
 Thank you that you made a way, the ultimate God

1370
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,200
 who just opens doors and saves his people

1371
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,580
 in spite of themselves.

1372
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,640
 Would you help us to not forfeit seeing you show up

1373
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,720
 by us choosing to be obedient and walk with you, God.

1374
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,560
 We love you.

1375
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,920
 We worship you in song, amen.

1376
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,280
