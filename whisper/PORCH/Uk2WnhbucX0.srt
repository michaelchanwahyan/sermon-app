 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:32,780
 Well, good evening, Porch.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,500
 How are we doing tonight?

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,700
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900
 My name is Timothy Atik.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,740
 I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,680
 I want to give a huge shout out to some of our Porch Live

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,380
 locations.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,460
 We've got Porch Live Fort Worth, Porch Live Boise,

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,060
 Porch Live Des Moines, and Porch Live Scottsdale.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,580
 So glad that you guys are tuning in tonight.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,300
 And then we've got a lot of people right here in Dallas.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,620
 And so glad that you guys are here as well.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,820
 So several years ago, almost a decade ago,

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,060
 I was the executive director of a ministry in Waco

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,820
 called Vertical Ministries, which

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,540
 is a ministry on the campus of Baylor University.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,560
 And Vertical met on Monday nights,

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,860
 and hundreds of students would gather together,

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,460
 kind of like what we're doing now, to worship and to study

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,100
 the Bible together.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,780
 And one of the perks of doing ministry at Baylor

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,700
 was the third floor of the Baylor library

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,260
 was all spiritual books, which is really

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,620
 helpful for someone like me.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,700
 So they had every resource that I could ever want.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,420
 So I did a lot of my work from the third floor of the Baylor

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,700
 library.

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,300
 And I will never forget this one time

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,980
 that I went up to work at Baylor's library.

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,060
 I went up, and it was during finals week.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,720
 And so the library was packed.

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,140
 Usually, it was easy to find a space.

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,420
 On this particular day, I had to take a lap

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,220
 around the entire floor.

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,820
 So I started going to my left, and I

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,040
 walked all the way around until I finally

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,980
 found one place to sit.

40
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,380
 And when I sat down, I'm going to be honest,

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,640
 I was a little disappointed because I

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,460
 entered the library with some pride in my heart.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,500
 I thought, you know what?

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,460
 I speak to hundreds of students every Monday night.

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,180
 I'm going into the library as the vertical guy,

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,580
 so I'm sure that as I walk and find my seat,

47
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,140
 there's going to be students who are waving and smiling.

48
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,720
 They want to pull me aside and tell me

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,940
 how I changed their life.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,080
 And I got to my seat, and no one said a thing.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
 No one looked up.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
 No one gave me a wave.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
 And I sat down.

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,760
 I was very disappointed.

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,680
 And as I sat down, something very interesting

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,920
 happened because as I sat in my seat, I looked on the seat,

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,240
 and there was this stream of toilet paper on my seat.

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,640
 I was like, that's so interesting.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,920
 And so I began to trace the toilet paper to its origin,

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,520
 and it was the back of my pants.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,480
 And so what I realized is I had just

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,960
 taken a lap around Baylor's third floor

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,800
 with a string of toilet paper about this long hanging out

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,360
 of my pants.

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,920
 And in that moment, who I thought I was

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,200
 and who I actually was collided.

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
 Because I went to the library thinking

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
 I was the cool vertical guy, and then when

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
 I got to the library and experienced what I did,

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,400
 I realized that wasn't the cool vertical guy.

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,360
 I was the creepy old man who didn't

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 know how to take care of business correctly.

73
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,200
 And who I was and who I thought I was collided in that moment.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,920
 And it was a humbling moment, very humbling moment,

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,800
 as this 30-something-year-old man

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,320
 in a sea of college students sat there at his desk,

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,480
 flustered, unable to concentrate.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,880
 Finally, I just packed up and left without the toilet paper.

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,920
 But I tell you that because as we step into the scriptures

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,160
 tonight, we are concluding our series

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,240
 that we've been calling The Return,

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,360
 Living Like Jesus is Coming Back.

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,760
 And as we step into the scriptures,

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,960
 we're actually going to look at a passage

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
 where we see what things will be like on the final day.

86
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 Like when Jesus actually comes back,

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,560
 we get a vision of what we can expect.

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,920
 And what I think that we're going

89
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,760
 to see in the passage that we're going to look at

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,840
 is it is going to be a moment of cosmic clarification, where

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,960
 many of us, for the first time on that day when Jesus comes

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
 back, it will take until then for us

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,920
 to realize who we thought we were and who we actually are.

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
 See, if I were to sit down and I were to ask you, hey,

95
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,200
 who are you, you know what you would start telling me?

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,720
 You would start telling me about what you figured out

97
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
 about how you're wired.

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,240
 You'd be like, I'm an Enneagram 3 wing 2, or I'm an ENFJ,

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
 whatever the letters are.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,720
 I'm super extroverted.

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,320
 I'm not.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,800
 Like you would tell me about your wiring,

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,640
 but those are just things that inventories or tests

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,800
 have told you.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
 And there's something way more true about you.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,400
 You have been made to see Jesus as the one and only true God,

107
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
 and you've been made to worship him.

108
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
 And yet some of us are going to get to that last day

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
 where Jesus is going to come back.

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
 And you know what we're going to realize?

111
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
 We're going to realize, we're going to look back,

112
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
 and we're going to realize that we

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
 spent so much of our lives trying

114
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
 to either be God or replace God.

115
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,120
 And you might sit there and be like, when have I ever tried

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,640
 to be God?

117
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,340
 Well, let me ask you, when have you ever

118
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,680
 done the shots in your own life?

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,120
 When have you ever said, I am going to date this person,

120
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
 even if it's not the best person for me to date.

121
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,720
 This is where I'm going to work, even if I have to cut corners.

122
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
 I'm going to spend more money than I make,

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,080
 because this is just what I want.

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,600
 When have you ever insisted on your own way?

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
 If you've ever insisted on your own way,

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
 or you've bought into the philosophy that, you know what?

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,840
 I just need to find my truth, and you

128
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
 need to find your truth, and whatever truth is good for you,

129
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
 that's great, and whatever truth is good for me is fine for me.

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,240
 Do you know what you're doing?

131
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,680
 You are trying to be God.

132
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,640
 We will realize that we've spent so much time either trying

133
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,260
 to be God or replace God.

134
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,760
 And so my hope today is that we wouldn't

135
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,560
 have to wait to that moment to get crystal clarity.

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,040
 Because in that moment, when we have that realization,

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,440
 and we see Jesus for all that he is, and in that moment,

138
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,080
 we realize what we've actually been made for,

139
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,560
 which is to worship him, in that moment, for many,

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,400
 it will be a very humbling moment.

141
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,280
 But we don't have to wait till then for that humbling moment

142
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,880
 to come.

143
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,480
 Right now, we can come to grips with who we are and who he is.

144
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,640
 And we can begin to respond rightly now to who he is now.

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,520
 And so that's my hope tonight.

146
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,120
 Because I want to be clear.

147
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,920
 There is only one God, and we are not him.

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
 And so it is good for us to realize that humility

149
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,760
 is a key to eternity.

150
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,260
 It is.

151
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,440
 Humility is a key to eternity.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,080
 You cannot experience eternity with Jesus Christ

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,520
 without humility towards him.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
 So if you have a Bible, I want to invite you

155
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,000
 to turn with me tonight to the book of Isaiah.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Isaiah chapter 2 is where we are going to be.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
 Isaiah chapter 2.

158
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,960
 Interestingly, yesterday morning, I

159
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,600
 woke up thinking that I was going

160
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,280
 a completely different direction with the message.

161
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,680
 And in my personal time with the Lord, in my Bible reading,

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
 I'm going through the book of Isaiah.

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
 And yesterday, I read Isaiah chapter 2.

164
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,640
 And I just sensed in my heart that this

165
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,360
 is where the porch needs to be.

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
 As we talk about the return, this series,

167
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,360
 as we bring it to conclusion, it feels

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,840
 like this passage could not be a better fit

169
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,880
 as it discusses the day when Jesus Christ will come back.

170
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,800
 And as we look at this passage, what we're going to see

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,680
 is the prophet Isaiah is going to encourage the nation

172
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,920
 of Israel to do two things.

173
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,800
 And my encouragement is that we would do these two things

174
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,280
 as well.

175
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,680
 Here's what we're going to see.

176
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
 Two things.

177
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,360
 Number one, exalt the God who will be exalted.

178
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,000
 Exalt the God who will be exalted.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,840
 And number two, humble yourself before you are humbled.

180
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,360
 Humble yourself before you are humbled.

181
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,960
 So let's start with the first one.

182
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,520
 First word of encouragement is this, exalt

183
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,040
 the God who will be exalted.

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,080
 When I use the word exalt, what I'm talking about

185
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,520
 is I'm talking about raising God's rank in your life.

186
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,960
 I'm talking about Jesus ranking higher than anyone or anything

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,520
 else to you.

188
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,120
 I'm talking about Jesus taking first place

189
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,360
 in your life and everything else being a distant second.

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,520
 Because a day is coming when God will

191
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,880
 be revealed as greater than anyone or anything.

192
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,800
 So look with me at Isaiah chapter 2, verse 1.

193
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,160
 It says, "The word that Isaiah, the son of Amos,

194
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,960
 saw concerning Judah in Jerusalem,

195
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,720
 it shall come to pass in the latter days."

196
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,160
 That in the Hebrew, it means the culmination of days.

197
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,280
 So what we're looking at right here

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,960
 is what we can expect at the culmination of days,

199
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,080
 the days when Jesus Christ will come back.

200
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,720
 It will come to pass in the latter days.

201
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,360
 "That the mountain of the house of the Lord

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,040
 shall be established as the highest of the mountains

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,800
 and shall be lifted up above the hills,

204
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
 and all the nations shall flow to it."

205
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,880
 So don't miss what I'm telling you right now.

206
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,280
 In the ancient Near East, mountains

207
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,960
 were very important in various religions

208
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,120
 because mountains were considered

209
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,800
 to be the places where heaven met earth.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,680
 And mountains were considered

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,120
 the dwelling places of the gods.

212
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,560
 And so what Isaiah is reminding Israel of is,

213
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,360
 on that day when God is revealed

214
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,200
 and we see God for who he is,

215
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
 God's mountain will dwarf any other mountains.

216
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
 All other mountains will just fade away.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,480
 And God will be seen as the one and only true God.

218
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,440
 He will be seen as preeminent,

219
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,440
 that there is no one in nothing that rivals God.

220
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
 So here's what that means.

221
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,720
 If the Bible is correct, then when Jesus comes back,

222
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,400
 there is going to be this cosmic clarification

223
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,680
 where we will find out that there has only been one true God

224
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,360
 and when his majesty and his splendor is revealed

225
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
 in such a way that every eye on the planet will see him,

226
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,400
 we will realize that all along,

227
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,160
 every single day of our lives,

228
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,000
 he was the only one who deserved our greatest allegiance

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,200
 and affection and adoration and obsession.

230
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
 Do you realize that that day is coming

231
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
 where you have the perspective

232
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 that no one deserved allegiance, affection, adoration

233
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,200
 or your obsession like Jesus did?

234
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,640
 Anyone or anything else that we have exalted

235
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,640
 or ranked above God will seem infinitely insignificant

236
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,360
 in that moment.

237
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,240
 So the question is, what does it look like now

238
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,120
 for us to begin to exalt him?

239
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,620
 What does it look like for us to live now

240
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,680
 how we will live for all of eternity?

241
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,580
 One of the best things we can do is begin to live

242
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,120
 how we will live in heaven.

243
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,560
 We should live that way now.

244
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,520
 If we will spend eternity exalting God,

245
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,320
 we should spend the rest of our time on earth exalting God.

246
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
 If he will take first place in our lives in heaven,

247
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,600
 he should take first place in our lives on earth.

248
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,400
 But first we have to identify

249
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,880
 what do we tend to exalt above God?

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,820
 I'm gonna show you something

251
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,580
 that I'm probably going to regret.

252
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,260
 My freshman year in college,

253
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,760
 I was in a dating relationship

254
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
 and I still have the mementos from that relationship.

255
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,100
 Now, the question is gonna surface in your mind,

256
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,800
 why do you still have that stuff?

257
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,880
 So here's the reality.

258
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 It was in my parents' house for years.

259
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,780
 And I looked up in the closet and I saw it,

260
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,700
 I was like, that'd be a great sermon illustration.

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,880
 My mom never threw it away when she was cleaning out.

262
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,860
 And I was married, my wife knew that I took it.

263
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,540
 Like I'm not at home like, my precious.

264
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,940
 Like, it's not like that, all right?

265
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,820
 So just to be clear, I'm not a freak, I'm not a weirdo.

266
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,380
 Like this is just, it's just, I had it.

267
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,540
 So, and if you're the girl

268
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,300
 and at some point you see this, I'm sorry.

269
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,580
 I promise I'm happily married.

270
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,420
 Like I'm not, anyway, okay.

271
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,740
 This was a beanie baby that she gave me.

272
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,160
 She sprayed it with her perfume so I could,

273
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,000
 you know what I'm saying?

274
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,960
 So there was that.

275
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,100
 This right here was a, this is called a mouse pad

276
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,900
 when we used to need mice for our computers.

277
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
 It was a baseball glove, I didn't play baseball,

278
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,740
 but there was a collage of her pictures

279
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,580
 so that I could always see her.

280
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,400
 So that's that.

281
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,220
 This is a pillow that we have a picture of the two of us

282
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,540
 ironed onto.

283
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,940
 So yeah, that's great.

284
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,780
 This unfortunately broke, but for you young people,

285
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,680
 this is called a CD, a compact disc.

286
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,180
 It's titled, "For My Perfect Boyfriend."

287
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,220
 That's this guy.

288
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,620
 And then this'll make you throw up in your mouth.

289
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,300
 And some of you guys went to A&M and you're like,

290
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
 not this again, God help me.

291
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,020
 But this, to be clear, I made this.

292
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,580
 And this is so dumb.

293
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,700
 This is a printout of every,

294
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:39,340
 don't judge me, of every message conversation.

295
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,820
 Hey, therapy has been super helpful.

296
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:52,780
 Now, let's just pray and get out of here.

297
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,740
 That's just.

298
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,860
 So, question.

299
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,460
 The disappointment in your faces, like it's real.

300
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,140
 Question, and if you've seen this and know the answer,

301
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,980
 don't yell it out.

302
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,760
 How long do you think we dated?

303
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:24,600
 Two months.

304
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,800
 I heard you, two months.

305
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,980
 Two months, yep.

306
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,240
 Now, don't miss this.

307
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,080
 Don't miss this.

308
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,860
 Some of you are like, are you kidding me?

309
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,240
 He is crazy.

310
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,360
 Here's what I can say confidently.

311
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,980
 What I can say with absolute certainty

312
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,580
 is that for those two months,

313
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,300
 that girl was without a doubt my God.

314
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,460
 And I was a follower of Jesus Christ at the time,

315
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,140
 but for those two months,

316
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,320
 she was hands down without a doubt my God.

317
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,660
 She got all of my time.

318
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,260
 She got all of my attention.

319
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,580
 She received all of my affection.

320
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,940
 She was for those two months, my obsession.

321
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,300
 And you can sit there and judge me

322
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,080
 and I don't blame you at all.

323
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,960
 I show you that to get you laughing

324
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,660
 before I turn it back on you and say,

325
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,420
 you might not have all this junk to show for it,

326
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,220
 but what's in your bag?

327
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,380
 What's in your bag?

328
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,380
 Who or what are you exalting above God?

329
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,260
 What's your greatest allegiance to?

330
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,220
 What do you adore the most?

331
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,460
 What gets the majority of your affection?

332
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,140
 What is your obsession?

333
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,940
 Like what do you lay awake at night thinking about?

334
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,500
 What do you lose sleep over?

335
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,300
 What stirs your heart in a way that Jesus never has?

336
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,340
 Maybe it's working out.

337
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,260
 Maybe it's your body.

338
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,260
 Maybe it's just, that's just all you can think about

339
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,980
 is how you look.

340
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
 Maybe it's your car.

341
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,680
 Maybe it's money.

342
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,000
 Maybe it's social media.

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,140
 Maybe it's constantly having plans on the weekend.

344
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,320
 Maybe it's the pursuit of the American dream.

345
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,060
 Maybe it's busyness, so you always feel important.

346
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,460
 Maybe it's having letters after your name,

347
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,860
 like MD or PhD.

348
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,300
 Maybe it's an influencer that you just hang on

349
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,100
 everything they say or do.

350
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,980
 It could be a pastor.

351
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,540
 It concerns me when I hear people are like,

352
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,340
 Ben said, Jenny said, JP said.

353
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,600
 I'm like, do you care more about hearing from them

354
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
 than God himself?

355
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,920
 And so it's just good for us to ask,

356
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,780
 what do we exalt more than Christ?

357
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,500
 What takes first place in your life, in mine?

358
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,740
 Do you wanna know the realization that I had

359
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,900
 as I just thought about all this stuff?

360
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
 Do you know what I felt once I got out of the relationship

361
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,020
 and got perspective?

362
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,900
 I felt embarrassment.

363
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,940
 I felt embarrassment that I had such a strong obsession

364
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,180
 in such a short period of time.

365
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,720
 My fear is that some of us are going to eventually

366
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,620
 see Jesus face to face, and in that moment,

367
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,460
 what we're gonna realize is that we had far too weak

368
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
 of an affection for far too long of a period of time.

369
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,700
 C.S. Lewis puts it this way.

370
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,740
 He says, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires

371
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740
 not too strong, but too weak.

372
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,460
 We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink

373
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,380
 and sex and ambition.

374
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,000
 When infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,920
 who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum

376
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,460
 because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer

377
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,960
 of a holiday at sea, we are far too easily pleased.

378
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,200
 Some of us, we lay in bed at night restless.

379
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,920
 Do you know what's happening is your soul is longing

380
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,360
 for the one for whom it's been created, Jesus.

381
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,880
 He's the only one who can satisfy the deepest longings

382
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,060
 of your soul.

383
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,860
 I said this on the first week of the series,

384
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,320
 so I just wanna say it again.

385
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 Don't wait until you see Jesus to finally see Jesus.

386
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,180
 Don't wait until you see Jesus to finally see Jesus.

387
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,600
 Don't wait for that day for Christ to finally be exalted.

388
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,100
 Today is the day for him to take first place

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,280
 in everything else to take a distant second.

390
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,180
 So you might ask, well, what does it look like

391
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,540
 for Christ to be exalted in my life?

392
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,120
 Well, here's the good news is if we keep reading

393
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,080
 in Isaiah chapter two, what we get is we get a picture

394
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,340
 of that day when Christ comes back.

395
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,640
 And what we see is we see people exalting Christ

396
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,780
 and it's very instructive.

397
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,920
 So look with me back at the text.

398
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,260
 It says at the end of verse two,

399
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,680
 "And all the nations shall flow to it."

400
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,520
 Flow to what?

401
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
 To the mountain of God.

402
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,540
 Verse three, "And many people shall come and say,

403
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,520
 "Come, let us go up the mountain of the Lord

404
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,060
 "to the house of the God of Jacob,

405
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,760
 "that he may teach us his ways,

406
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,680
 "that we may walk in his paths.

407
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,160
 "For out of Zion shall go forth the law

408
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,520
 "and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

409
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,900
 "He shall judge between the nations

410
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,040
 "and shall decide disputes for many peoples

411
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,100
 "and they shall beat their swords into plowshares

412
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,260
 "and their spears into pruning hooks.

413
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,760
 "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,

414
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,560
 "neither shall they learn war anymore."

415
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 So do you see what we see there?

416
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,100
 We see that a day is coming where a magnitude

417
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,060
 of universal proportions of people

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,220
 will be seeking and hungering for God.

419
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,860
 There will be people from every tribe, tongue, and nation,

420
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,180
 every people group who are seeking after God.

421
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,740
 And as they seek for God, how will Christ be exalted?

422
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,820
 Well, they will hunger for him.

423
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,040
 They will want to see him and behold him.

424
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,140
 They will want to learn from him.

425
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,060
 His word will be supremely authoritative in their lives.

426
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,240
 His ways will be the only true way.

427
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,140
 That's what it looks like to exalt Christ.

428
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,900
 Now it's for you to position your life

429
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,440
 to where you consistently gaze at Jesus Christ,

430
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,740
 for you to see him for who he truly is.

431
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,860
 It's waking up each morning and coming to his word

432
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,820
 and saying, "Jesus, I want to see you in your word.

433
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,400
 "I want to learn from you.

434
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,900
 "You have a right to speak into my life.

435
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,020
 "Your ways are the best ways.

436
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,620
 "I choose you, Jesus, about anything else in my life.

437
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,520
 "Your way is the best way.

438
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
 "You, Jesus, have a right to rule in my heart

439
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,860
 "and in my life."

440
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,560
 That's what it looks like to exalt Christ.

441
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,740
 And what we see is a day is coming

442
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,280
 where Jesus' rule will be realized throughout the earth.

443
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,900
 That's why you see the spears are turned into,

444
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,240
 or swords are turned into pruning hooks

445
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,560
 or into plowshares.

446
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,620
 What is that imagery?

447
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,360
 It's that items of war become farming tools

448
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,580
 because Eden in some way will be restored.

449
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,480
 Paradise will be restored.

450
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,320
 And we will have the privilege of spending all of eternity

451
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,740
 in the presence of Jesus.

452
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,960
 Here's what you need to know.

453
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,700
 One thing that I see happening,

454
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,220
 especially with young adults,

455
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,340
 it happened with my group of friends

456
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,440
 coming out of Tex A&M,

457
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,220
 is sometimes we take intermissions

458
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,100
 between Jesus being Savior and Jesus being Lord.

459
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,160
 And so we want Jesus to save us from our sin,

460
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,020
 but we don't necessarily want Jesus to save us

461
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,060
 into a new life with him

462
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,780
 where he begins to lead us and direct us

463
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,480
 and call the shots.

464
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,500
 And so we want Jesus to be Savior.

465
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,920
 And it's like, yes, I'm so thankful

466
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,860
 that you are my ticket into heaven.

467
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,380
 But Jesus isn't just Savior, he's also King.

468
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,340
 What do kings do?

469
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,180
 Kings rule.

470
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,740
 He's given you his word so you can know his ways.

471
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,060
 He's given you his spirit

472
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,700
 because his spirit wants to make you more like him.

473
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,460
 So here's what you need to know.

474
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,260
 When Jesus Christ went to the cross,

475
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,460
 when he sacrificed himself,

476
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,700
 when he endured the wrath of God for your sins and mine,

477
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,980
 when he walked out of the grave victoriously,

478
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,860
 he didn't just do it to get you into heaven.

479
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,960
 He did it to get heaven into you now.

480
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,640
 He wants to make you more like him now.

481
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,640
 And that happens by us beginning to exalt him,

482
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,400
 by allowing him to take first place.

483
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,840
 If you're here tonight

484
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,480
 and you're not a follower of Jesus Christ,

485
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
 you're not a Christian, someone invited you,

486
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,940
 let me just say, I'm so glad you're here.

487
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,440
 The porch will always be a place

488
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,400
 where people who don't know Jesus can come

489
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,280
 and just explore and ask questions and figure it out.

490
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,100
 But you might've just heard me say

491
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,680
 that a day is coming where God,

492
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
 the God where Jesus is God,

493
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,480
 will one day be shown to be the only true God.

494
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,840
 And maybe you have believed in another religion

495
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,560
 or another God and what I'm saying is confusing to you

496
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,000
 or frustrating to you.

497
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,720
 Here's what I would just say to you.

498
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
 We live in a world right now

499
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,800
 where we wanna act like heaven is kind of a ski mountain

500
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
 and there's a bunch of different lifts to get to heaven.

501
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,800
 And so as long as you find your way to the top

502
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,220
 and I find my way to the top,

503
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,060
 it really doesn't matter

504
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,040
 because they all end in the same place.

505
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,480
 But here's what every religion,

506
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,060
 here's the question every religion needs to answer.

507
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,520
 How do we imperfect people get to be with a perfect God?

508
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,660
 How do we down here, imperfect people,

509
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,580
 get up there with a perfect God in a perfect place, heaven?

510
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,500
 It's impossible.

511
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,780
 No matter how hard you try to get to him,

512
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,620
 you will always be imperfect.

513
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,120
 See, the good news of the gospel is that

514
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,420
 God came down the mountain to get us.

515
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,880
 Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth.

516
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,440
 The eternal word of God took on flesh, Jesus Christ.

517
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,180
 He lived a perfect life.

518
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,880
 He died in our place.

519
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,680
 He conquered death.

520
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,540
 Why?

521
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,380
 So that he could take imperfect people with him to heaven

522
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,240
 and his perfection would be our entrance

523
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,880
 and his perfection would be what sustains us

524
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,620
 for all of eternity.

525
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,020
 Do you know him?

526
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,800
 If you don't, then let me just encourage you

527
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,760
 to be careful with the idea of, you know what?

528
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,520
 I'll just find my own truth.

529
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
 Here's what you have to remember.

530
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,760
 Just because you believe something doesn't mean it's true.

531
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,300
 Your beliefs have no bearing on truth, okay?

532
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,080
 And so you can believe it, but that doesn't mean it's true.

533
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,360
 Finding your own truth might bring you comfort temporarily,

534
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,160
 but cannot support you for eternity.

535
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 If the Bible is true, a day is coming

536
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,240
 when it will be revealed that there is only one true God.

537
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,060
 And that one true God has been deserving

538
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,160
 of your greatest affection every day of your life

539
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,880
 and will be for all of eternity.

540
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,600
 So the first thing is exalt the God,

541
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,760
 the God where Jesus is God, exalt the God

542
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,840
 who will be exalted.

543
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,780
 And then number two, humble yourselves

544
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,400
 before you are humbled.

545
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,280
 Humble yourselves before you are humbled.

546
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,600
 Do you know what pride is?

547
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,840
 Pride is the posture of your life and heart

548
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
 when you have an inflated view of God,

549
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,040
 when you have an inflated view of self

550
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,440
 due to a deflated view of God.

551
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
 That's what pride is.

552
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,360
 Pride is the posture of your life and heart

553
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,480
 when you have an inflated view of yourself

554
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,820
 and a deflated view of God.

555
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,040
 Humility is the reverse.

556
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,720
 An inflated view of God,

557
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,880
 which breeds a deflated view of self.

558
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,400
 He is great, we are not.

559
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,960
 He is God, we are not.

560
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,040
 And so look at what Isaiah chapter two, verse five says.

561
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,960
 It says, "O house of Jacob, come,

562
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,680
 "let us walk in the light of the Lord."

563
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,880
 What is the light of the Lord?

564
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,520
 It is what gives us guidance and direction.

565
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
 There's gonna be a contrast here

566
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,040
 because Isaiah goes on and says,

567
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,920
 "For you," that's God has rejected your people,

568
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,200
 the nation of Israel, the house of Jacob, why?

569
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,320
 Because they are full of things from the east.

570
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,000
 The sun rises in what?

571
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
 The east.

572
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,520
 Some of y'all are like, not sure.

573
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,600
 The east.

574
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,600
 And so what Isaiah is saying is,

575
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,120
 hey, you guys are looking to the light of the world.

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,280
 Instead of the light of God.

577
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,120
 What he's doing is he's calling them out

578
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
 and saying, you're looking within,

579
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,060
 you're looking under the sun for life,

580
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,060
 instead of looking beyond the sun to God for your direction.

581
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:54,000
 You're full of things from the east.

582
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,240
 And of fortune tellers like the Philistines,

583
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,040
 he's saying you're relying on human ingenuity.

584
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,680
 And they strike hands with the children of foreigners.

585
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,140
 He's saying, you guys are learning

586
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,680
 and you're taking pages from the playbooks

587
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,820
 of people who do not know God.

588
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,580
 And so what's the result?

589
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,660
 The result is pride.

590
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,660
 The result is pride because what the nation of Israel

591
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,140
 is guilty of doing is they are trying to be God.

592
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,600
 How are they trying to be God?

593
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,280
 Because they're saying, you know what?

594
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,280
 We can figure out life on our own under the sun.

595
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,100
 We can use human ingenuity to figure out the best way.

596
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,040
 They're looking at other people who don't know God

597
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,180
 and learning from them and they're saying, you know what?

598
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,720
 We can do this without God.

599
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,960
 They're trying to be God.

600
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,760
 And not only are they trying to be God,

601
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,480
 they're trying to replace God.

602
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,440
 He goes on in verse seven and says,

603
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,640
 their land is filled with silver and gold

604
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,620
 and there's no end to their treasures.

605
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,440
 They were looking to material wealth

606
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,880
 and stuff to be their God.

607
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 Their land is filled with horses

608
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,360
 and there's no end to their chariots.

609
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,780
 They were looking to security to be their God.

610
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,100
 Their land is filled with idols.

611
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,900
 They bow down to the work of their hands,

612
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,960
 to what their own fingers have made.

613
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,960
 They're looking to man-made religion to be their God.

614
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,800
 They are actually making gods

615
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,140
 in finding their fulfillment in them.

616
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,080
 That's what they're doing.

617
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,020
 And the crazy thing is that not much has changed

618
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,300
 in the thousands of years since the book of Isaiah

619
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,140
 was written.

620
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,480
 So let me just ask you to just look at me real quick

621
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,900
 and answer this question.

622
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,160
 We'll even have it on the screen.

623
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,660
 Just fill in the blank.

624
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,900
 If I only had what, then I would be happy.

625
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,720
 What is it?

626
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,540
 Just fill in the blank.

627
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,580
 If I only had what, what is it?

628
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,900
 Then you would be happy.

629
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,820
 See, some of us believe just like the nation of Israel,

630
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,660
 the key to happiness is stuff.

631
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,300
 It's stuff, it's material possessions or it's status.

632
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,900
 You want a job title that you're proud to say

633
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,000
 when you are in groups of people

634
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,420
 because it will give you significance.

635
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,620
 You value stuff.

636
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,060
 You want to drive the car you want to drive.

637
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,120
 You want to live in the apartment complex

638
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
 you want to live in.

639
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,260
 You want to go ahead and buy a house now.

640
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,680
 You want stuff.

641
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,320
 You want season tickets to the maps.

642
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,860
 You want your own stuff.

643
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,420
 That's where happiness is found.

644
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,680
 For others of you, the key to happiness is security.

645
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,540
 So man, you're saving all your money

646
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,360
 because when you look at your bank account,

647
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
 like there's safety and security there.

648
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,060
 When you look at how your 401k is accumulating money,

649
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,300
 there's security there.

650
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,540
 Or if you could just get a spouse,

651
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,660
 then you would feel safe and secure

652
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,100
 that you're not going to be single forever.

653
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,000
 And for others, the key to happiness is,

654
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,500
 it's man-made religion.

655
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's you just figuring out

656
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,700
 what makes you feel good about yourself.

657
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,900
 So you know what, I go to the porch on Tuesday night

658
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,180
 because I just feel better about myself after I go.

659
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,860
 You know what, I read that latest pastor's book

660
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,900
 and it's kind of, I'm doing that instead of reading

661
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,740
 my Bible, but it's kind of the same thing

662
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,500
 because there's Bible verses in it.

663
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,340
 And so really that makes me feel better about myself.

664
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,940
 It's man-made religion.

665
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,540
 Maybe you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

666
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,540
 but in your time with God, time with God is you,

667
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,740
 just, it's you feeling better.

668
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,460
 Like you're a better person than other people.

669
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,240
 So you spend your time with God and then you go out

670
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,020
 and you feel like you are crushing life

671
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,900
 in a way that others aren't.

672
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,980
 So your time with God is more about your image

673
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,820
 than it is about intimacy with God.

674
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,980
 And so you know what we're doing?

675
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,900
 We're taking God's gifts, 'cause these aren't bad things.

676
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,780
 401ks, they're good things, you should save, people.

677
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,580
 Driving a car, not a bad thing.

678
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,140
 You're probably gonna need one.

679
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,220
 These things aren't bad in and of themselves.

680
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,640
 You know where they go bad is when we take God's gifts

681
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,260
 and we turn them into God's.

682
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,680
 That is what we tend to do.

683
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,160
 We take good things and we make them ultimate things.

684
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,400
 And we switch places with God.

685
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:43,840
 We have to understand that to try to be God

686
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,160
 or to replace God is to be against God.

687
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
 There isn't a form of Christianity

688
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,060
 where it is acceptable to God for us to function

689
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,840
 like one pastor said, Christian atheists.

690
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,040
 What's a Christian atheist?

691
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,400
 A Christian atheist is someone

692
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,640
 who gets their ticket into heaven

693
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,400
 and they call themselves a Christian

694
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,800
 and yet they live like they don't know Jesus,

695
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,480
 the one who will be exalted over all the earth.

696
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,580
 And so we try and be God or we try and replace God.

697
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,780
 That is Christian atheism.

698
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,940
 Several years ago, we made plans to take our boys

699
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,140
 to Legoland in California.

700
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,380
 So Legoland, it's this great amusement park.

701
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,000
 It's just built out of Legos.

702
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,380
 Like it's crazy, it's amazing.

703
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,700
 It's a dream for a five-year-old boy.

704
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,760
 So we were planning to go to Legoland.

705
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,660
 We were going in about two to three weeks

706
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,560
 and we were living in Austin at the time.

707
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,980
 We went into the Barton Creek Mall,

708
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,060
 if you've ever been there.

709
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,500
 And in Barton Creek, there was a Lego store.

710
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,840
 So we went into the Lego store

711
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,420
 and my son Noah, who was about five years old at the time,

712
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
 he saw this Lego key chain.

713
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,460
 He was like, "Dad, can I have the Lego key chain?"

714
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,520
 I was like, "Hey dude, here's the deal."

715
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,780
 In like two, three weeks, we're going to Legoland.

716
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,460
 Not Lego store, Legoland.

717
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,900
 And you can get whatever you want then.

718
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,420
 "But dad, I want the Lego key chain now."

719
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,500
 And this was not the best parenting.

720
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,180
 I'm just going to own it from now.

721
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,140
 Like I was just kind of thinking on the spot.

722
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,380
 When you're a parent, you know what parenting is.

723
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,260
 Parenting is having no clue what to do

724
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,860
 and just trying your best.

725
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,060
 That's what parenting is.

726
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,900
 So in the moment, here's what I said.

727
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,060
 I was like, "Hey man, here's the deal.

728
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,480
 "We can either go to Legoland,

729
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,640
 "you can get whatever you want,

730
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,060
 "or you can get this key chain.

731
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,020
 "We can cancel going to Legoland."

732
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,380
 It was a bluff, people.

733
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,220
 It was a bluff.

734
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,500
 I wouldn't have canceled the trip.

735
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,460
 You know what he said?

736
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,620
 "I'll take the key chain."

737
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,320
 I was like, "Oh my gosh."

738
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,980
 But you know what Noah was saying?

739
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,980
 He was saying, "This is what I need most."

740
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,380
 And yet me, his dad, I had a perspective

741
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,260
 that he didn't have.

742
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,220
 I knew what was waiting for him.

743
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,860
 I knew all of the beauty, all of the greatness,

744
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,700
 all of the enjoyment that waited for him.

745
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,140
 But in his mind, this is what he needed now.

746
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,460
 And so when a five-year-old does that with Legoland,

747
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,020
 we chalk it up to youth.

748
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,380
 But when adults do that with God,

749
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,100
 when God has given us his word,

750
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,340
 and what has he declared to us in his word?

751
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,140
 There is no other God but me.

752
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,380
 In my presence, there is fullness of joy.

753
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,620
 At my right hand are pleasures forevermore.

754
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,060
 I came that you might have life and have it to the full.

755
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,700
 I am the way, the truth, and the life.

756
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,540
 No one comes to the Father except through me.

757
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,300
 And yet we're like, "You know what?

758
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,220
 "But you know what?

759
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,300
 "I'm gonna find my life in this stuff,

760
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,140
 "or in this person, or in this thing, or in this status."

761
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,080
 When it's a five-year-old with Legoland, that's youth.

762
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,380
 When it's an adult doing that with God, that's pride.

763
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,620
 It's pride.

764
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,020
 And so my encouragement to us

765
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,580
 is that we would humble ourselves before we are humbled.

766
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,700
 Because look at what Isaiah 2, verses 9 through 11 say.

767
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,780
 It says this, "So man is humbled.

768
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,060
 "Each one is brought low.

769
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,420
 "Do not forgive them.

770
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,320
 "Enter into the rock and hide in the dust

771
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,060
 "from before the terror of the Lord

772
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,180
 "and from the splendor of his majesty.

773
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,680
 "The haughty looks of man shall be brought low.

774
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,040
 "The lofty pride of men shall be humbled.

775
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,900
 "The Lord alone will be exalted in that day."

776
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,740
 It's interesting because what Isaiah is saying is,

777
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,660
 "Look, you've looked for life

778
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,440
 "and you have made gods out of things in the material world.

779
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,120
 "So because that's where you looked for life,

780
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,440
 "that's where you're gonna have to look to hide

781
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,800
 "when the majesty and splendor melts everything away

782
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,800
 "and all you see is God exalted above the earth."

783
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,580
 So his point is come now, humble yourselves now.

784
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,760
 Don't wait to be humbled.

785
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,760
 Humble yourselves now under the mighty hand of God.

786
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,420
 When Jesus comes back, we will have one of two responses,

787
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,940
 either worship or shame.

788
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,560
 We will either worship him

789
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,480
 because that's what we've already been doing.

790
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,860
 We've already seen him for who he is, the one true God.

791
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,780
 And so we've lived lives of worship.

792
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,500
 And when he comes back, our worship just intensifies.

793
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,240
 Or we're gonna experience shame

794
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,440
 because we're gonna realize that we spent our lives

795
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,020
 worshiping the wrong gods.

796
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,940
 And so let me just ask, where do we go from here?

797
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,640
 What I'm trying to do is I'm not trying to beat us

798
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,740
 over the head tonight.

799
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,480
 I'm trying to drive us towards humility.

800
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,240
 I'm trying to drive us towards sight

801
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,040
 for us to open up our eyes, to not just live for today,

802
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 but to live for eternity, to not just live for today,

803
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,880
 but to live for that day.

804
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,680
 Jesus is coming back.

805
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,440
 It's not a question of if, it's a matter of when.

806
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,680
 We don't know.

807
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,920
 So one of the, you know what the greatest form of pride is?

808
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,840
 It's to say, well, it won't be today

809
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,380
 and it won't be tomorrow.

810
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,440
 And so I'll figure it out someday.

811
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,100
 That's the greatest form of pride

812
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:45,100
 because what you're saying is I know that I'm fine

813
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,520
 until I decide to get right with God.

814
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,640
 When my kids were young,

815
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,240
 I'd take them to the grocery store with me

816
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,360
 and you've seen these shopping carts,

817
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,480
 but grocery stores have shopping carts that are race cars,

818
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,360
 which are amazing.

819
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,600
 Always get the race cars if you've got kids

820
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,720
 like two or three years old.

821
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,960
 So you put your kid in the car

822
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,840
 and there's a steering wheel there

823
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,440
 and they sit there and drive

824
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,040
 while you were pushing them through.

825
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,680
 Now, I want you to think about this.

826
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,040
 Imagine what it would be like in the grocery store

827
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,480
 if there was actually power to those steering wheels.

828
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,920
 Can you imagine the madness, the chaos

829
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,060
 when little toddlers have their way?

830
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,840
 Now, thankfully there is no power to those steering wheels

831
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,760
 and there is a good parent who's in control

832
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,560
 running the show.

833
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,620
 See, we all have to come to a realization

834
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,720
 that there is a difference between who we think we are

835
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,020
 and who we actually are.

836
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,400
 Who we think we are is we think that we're God,

837
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
 that we're in control,

838
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,740
 that we can figure life out on our own,

839
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,940
 that if there's power to the steering wheel,

840
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,640
 we can flourish.

841
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,320
 But who we actually are is we're the toddler

842
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,320
 in the shopping cart and left to ourselves.

843
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,640
 We're broken.

844
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,800
 What we all have to do is we have to look back

845
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
 and we have to see that there is a good, perfect father

846
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,120
 who is directing our lives

847
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,400
 and his son Jesus has come to restore us

848
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,760
 into right relationship with the father.

849
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,600
 Why?

850
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,840
 So that we can live life with him.

851
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,800
 (gentle music)

852
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,720
 Humility is the key to eternity.

853
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,760
 So if you're here tonight and you don't know Jesus Christ,

854
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,880
 then my encouragement to you tonight

855
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,200
 is to make a decision to seek out the truth,

856
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,180
 not your truth, the truth.

857
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,320
 Seek it out.

858
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,200
 Go on a relentless search

859
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,040
 until you find the truth.

860
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,840
 And I believe you will find the truth in Jesus Christ.

861
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
 Humble yourself.

862
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,800
 Make the decision.

863
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,000
 You don't have it all figured out.

864
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,820
 That's okay.

865
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,660
 None of us do.

866
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,420
 But find the truth.

867
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,640
 If you're here and you consider yourself a Christian,

868
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,120
 I'm not trying to cause anyone to doubt their salvation.

869
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,640
 I'm just trying to have a clarifying conversation

870
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,880
 with a few people in the room.

871
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,740
 If you call yourself a Christian

872
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,960
 and yet you spend your days trying to be God

873
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,600
 or replace God,

874
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,240
 all I wanna do is I wanna invite you

875
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,960
 to humble yourself and repent tonight.

876
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,860
 And I wanna invite you to see Jesus clearly.

877
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,840
 Who is our Jesus?

878
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,440
 Jesus is the one who humbled himself.

879
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,440
 Philippians 2 says that he humbled himself

880
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,040
 and he became a servant.

881
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,440
 And he died.

882
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,780
 He died in our place.

883
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,780
 He humbled himself to the point of death,

884
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,780
 even death on a cross.

885
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,580
 And after his death, he walked out of a tomb.

886
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,900
 Therefore, he has been highly exalted

887
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,300
 and he has the name which is above every name

888
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,500
 so that at the name of Jesus,

889
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,820
 every knee would bow and every tongue would confess

890
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,660
 that he is Lord.

891
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,540
 That's who he is.

892
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,840
 I'm inviting you tonight to repent,

893
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,340
 to turn from your ways of being God or replacing God

894
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,600
 and turn to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords

895
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,220
 and fully surrender to him.

896
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,380
 And finally, if you have a real and intimate,

897
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,700
 enjoyable relationship with Jesus Christ,

898
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,100
 then my encouragement to you

899
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,900
 is just continually identify the things

900
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,900
 that threaten to compete with God's place in your life.

901
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,260
 Even right now, just identify who or what

902
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,380
 are you sensing you need more than you need Jesus.

903
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,700
 And whatever it is, just turn that over to the Lord

904
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,140
 and invite him to do a new work in your life.

905
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,580
 Ask him to give you eyes to see him more clearly

906
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,860
 so that he would be exalted in your life.

907
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,180
 And then I would just leave you

908
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,460
 with the words of John the Baptist.

909
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,700
 John the Baptist says in John 3:30,

910
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,820
 these are words to live by.

911
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,580
 He says, "He must increase, but I must decrease."

912
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,140
 That's humility.

913
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,360
 That's coming to the realization

914
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,740
 of not who you think you are, but who you actually are.

915
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,180
 That you've been made to worship him

916
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,020
 and he is the exalted one over all creation.

917
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,940
 He must increase, but I must decrease.

918
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,940
 Let's pray together.

919
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,520
 (gentle music)

920
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:04,060
 Lord, if there's anyone in this room tonight

921
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,180
 who doesn't know you,

922
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,800
 then my hope and prayer, even in this moment,

923
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,920
 is that they would sense

924
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,020
 that you are reaching into their lives,

925
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,820
 opening up their eyes

926
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,320
 so that they can see you clearly, Lord Jesus.

927
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,060
 I pray that there would be someone tonight

928
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,660
 who would put their trust in you.

929
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,940
 And if that's you, if you're here tonight

930
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,820
 and you're just saying, "Yeah, I wanna say yes to Jesus."

931
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,500
 If that's you, just right where you are,

932
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,140
 just pray in the quietness of your own heart.

933
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,360
 Say, "Lord Jesus, I want you to be exalted in my life.

934
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,060
 "Thank you that you died for me.

935
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,660
 "Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

936
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,360
 "Would you come into my life?

937
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,300
 "Would you forgive me of my sins?

938
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,540
 "Would you begin to lead me in a new life?"

939
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,580
 And for the rest of us,

940
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,460
 I just wanna invite you to do business with the Lord

941
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,380
 in the quietness of your own heart.

942
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,540
 Maybe the worst thing you could do right now

943
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,140
 is just rush out or to quickly respond by singing.

944
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,020
 Maybe you just need to do business with Him.

945
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,420
 Maybe you need to confess

946
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,340
 where you have exalted other people or other things,

947
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,540
 where you've tried to play God in your own life,

948
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,400
 and you just need to ask for forgiveness.

949
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,600
 You need to experience His grace.

950
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,800
 Whatever He's doing in your life, respond to Him now.

951
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,880
 Lord Jesus, we need you, we love you.

952
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,360
 Be exalted in this place for our good and for your glory.

953
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,940
 In Jesus' name.

954
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,520
 (gentle music)
