[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:21.340]   - Man, that is intense, and I'm not sleeping tonight.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.540]   - Hey, welcome, we are kicking off a brand new series
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.920]   tonight called The Unseen, where we will cover
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.440]   spiritual war, worlds, and wonders over the next few weeks.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.520]   And so if it is your first time joining with us,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.960]   we are so glad that you are here,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.160]   whether that is in Dallas or downtown,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.680]   at Gillies or in Fort Worth, or Houston,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.720]   or wherever you are tuning in.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   Anyone a germaphobe in this room?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.880]   Or let me say it another way,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.420]   anyone normal and sane in this room?
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.160]   Like myself?
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.120]   My team likes to say that I am a hypochondriac,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   and they may be right,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.240]   but the reason why they say that,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   or the reason why that is,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.440]   is because, I don't know if you're like me,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.400]   but hand sanitizer is one of my best friends in the world.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.680]   I keep some in my bag, I keep some in my car,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.520]   two at home, one at my desk, it's everywhere,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.920]   because I hate getting sick.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.280]   Can anyone relate to this?
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.720]   Anyone like, hey, I'm anti-germ?
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.040]   What is wrong with the rest of you?
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.320]   Wash your stinking hands, you people!
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.400]   I mean, when I go to eat with somebody,
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.180]   like if we were to go out to a meal,
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.280]   it happens every single time,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760]   and I always feel like I'm weird for doing this,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.280]   and I'm always like, what is wrong with you?
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.400]   We'll sit down at the table, go into the restaurant,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.040]   get there, begin to sit down, awesome.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.880]   Hey, I'm gonna go to the restroom,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.000]   gotta wash my hands, and I'll go to it,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   and I'll leave the person at the table,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.040]   go wash my hands, and they'll just continue eating
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.720]   right away, like so much so that like,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.080]   I don't wanna shake somebody's hand.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.640]   If we're starting to eat at the meal,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.960]   I'm like, I'll do the fist bump,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.120]   and I feel like it's rude of you
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760]   to expect me to shake your hand right now.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.960]   I'm not taking whatever disease you wanna pass on.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.500]   And if you're like that, maybe you can relate,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.320]   where you're like, man, I just, I don't love getting sick
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.160]   or getting germs.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.240]   Here's what's interesting about that.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840]   It is like 200 years ago, less than that, actually,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680]   like even the idea of being a germophobe,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.400]   that term did not exist, the idea of like,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.360]   hey, germs and shaking hands and getting them that way
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.360]   or bacteria did not exist for the longest time
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   inside of really our world.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   There was no belief or people were not aware
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.200]   that there was such thing as germs or bacteria,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   and they just thought that disease
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   and the way that it spread,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.540]   there really wasn't a clear explanation
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.560]   for kind of how it spread.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.640]   I mean, this is like the 1800s we're talking,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.680]   even in the later part of the 1800s,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.040]   where people just thought there was something called
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.080]   spontaneous generation, which may take you back
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.760]   to like biology class in eighth grade,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   where you study this one time and then forgot it,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.800]   but where the belief was, hey, disease,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.680]   the way it was explained was spontaneous generation.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160]   Sometimes it would just pop up spontaneously,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.900]   it would generate, and so there wasn't always
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.720]   a clear rhyme or reason and people would get sick
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.120]   and they'd be around other people,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240]   and those people wouldn't get sick,
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.200]   but someone else close to them would,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.980]   and it just didn't always make sense,
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.480]   and people didn't know, and they just thought
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   it's spontaneous generation, just spontaneously
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.220]   will generate and disease will pop up,
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.140]   until this guy came along, and yes,
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.520]   Colonel Sanders, and no, this is Luis Pasteur,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.720]   and Luis Pasteur, if you remember him in that class
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.880]   that you were probably sleeping in,
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.400]   they talked about how pasteurization,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.760]   and he came along and he proposed that no,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.720]   hey, spontaneous generation with disease,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.960]   that is not how this thing works.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.360]   I mean, tragically, what drove him to really get into this
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.240]   and begin to devote his life to medical and disease
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.460]   and studying it was that he had five kids,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.720]   and three of them died from typhoid fever,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.000]   and so he said, man, if there's a way to prevent disease,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   I'm gonna spend the rest of my life studying it
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.960]   to understand it and know how we could either prevent it
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.640]   or treat it, so he begins to study,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.080]   and here's what he begins to discover
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.960]   through all these different tests,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.840]   he says, it's not spontaneous generation.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.260]   There's these things called germs.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.760]   There's these things called bacteria,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.240]   and you can't see 'em, it's like these invisible things,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.220]   and they're everywhere, like they're on the door handles
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.040]   you touch, they're on the money in your pockets,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.480]   they're on the clothes that you're wearing.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.900]   When you shake hands with people,
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.440]   they're passing all these different germs,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   and that is the reason why people are getting sick.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.500]   Whenever you're using that utensil, I mean,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.760]   think about it, to us, we're like, really, that's crazy,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.660]   they didn't know this.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.680]   The world in which he began to really push
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.880]   this idea forward, many people thought you're crazy.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.360]   Like this knife that I just used in surgery,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.180]   like it has these germs on it, I ran it underwater,
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.240]   I think it would be fine, and he's going,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   no, there's still bacteria on it, there's germs,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.560]   there's this invisible world,
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   and it is impacting the world around us,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.960]   and if you're not careful, it's gonna lead,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.160]   not just to you getting sick,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.640]   people could possibly even die,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.480]   there's this invisible world, and people are going,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.160]   there's, Luis, really, there's an invisible world
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.260]   out there that's impacting the visible world
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.740]   that I live in, and he would say, yes, all around you.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.800]   The things that you cannot see are being impacted
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.820]   by the things that you cannot.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.440]   And the reason I start there is because,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.960]   just like people thought, it was crazy at the time
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   that there's this invisible world that exists out there
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.560]   that's impacting the visible world,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.360]   when Luis Pastore introduced the idea of germs,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.160]   or germ theory, in the same way,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.640]   the Bible says there's another invisible world,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.520]   that it's not just the invisible world of germs,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.140]   and bacteria, and disease, and things like that,
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.020]   there is a visible or invisible world
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.360]   that is impacting the visible world in which we live,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.000]   and there is this spiritual, unseen realm
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   that just like germs, and just like people thought,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.520]   oh, that's crazy, just in that same way,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.800]   the Bible says it's impacting the world in which we live,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.000]   and in the world in which you and I inhabit.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.480]   And just like with Pastore, the more the belief
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   in germ theory kinda caught on,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.440]   the more things began to make sense,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.380]   because they began to sterilize utensils
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.800]   when they did surgery, they began to change
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.520]   kind of behavior, began to not shake hands with someone
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.240]   when they were sick, and all of a sudden,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.200]   people stopped getting sick as much.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.280]   And things began to make sense, it's like,
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.540]   oh, that makes sense why we get sick,
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.640]   I was around, I shared the same room,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.440]   or drink, or cup with this person who was sick,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640]   and all of a sudden, it clicked into place.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.700]   Tonight, and for the next few weeks,
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.780]   we're gonna study the idea of this unseen realm,
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.040]   what the Bible says about it, and in doing so,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.200]   so much of your experience, my experience in life,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.960]   all of a sudden becomes to come to focus,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.720]   so much of the world around us,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.880]   and the craziness that's there, begins to make sense.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.040]   And also, just like, Pastore didn't cure germs.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.680]   Like, he didn't come up with the cure for germs,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.680]   all he did was expose the reality that they exist.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.740]   There's these invisible, you can't see 'em,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.200]   and I don't have a cure for 'em,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.920]   but I'm gonna at least expose you to the truth
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.960]   that they're there.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.800]   And what we're gonna do tonight,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.240]   through the Apostle Paul and the teachings
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.600]   of the Scriptures, is be exposed to the reality
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.160]   and the truth that there is an invisible realm,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   and it is impacting your world.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.440]   It is impacting your dating life,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.240]   it is impacting your work life,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.400]   it is impacting your personal sin patterns, addictions,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.960]   it is impacting the way that you view yourself,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.120]   it is impacting arenas of life, even beyond you.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.000]   It is impacting your parents' marriage,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.560]   it is impacting the national perspective
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.400]   of our country right now.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   There's all these different layers,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.440]   and they're being impacted,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   and we're just gonna expose ourselves,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.160]   just like Pastor didn't cure it,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.880]   he just exposed that it's there.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.040]   Hopefully in the next few minutes,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.240]   we are going to expose ourselves to it there,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   and in the weeks ahead, begin to explore
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.640]   what it's like to live inside of the seen world
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.600]   in light of the unseen world that's there.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.920]   So we're gonna look at three ideas from the text,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.760]   three ideas from the text.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   We're gonna be in Ephesians chapter six for the first one,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.840]   and we'll dive in, really, to the idea
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.360]   of how there is an unseen realm.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.520]   There is an unseen reason
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.640]   for the evil that exists inside of our world,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.960]   and there is an unseen enemy
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.080]   that exists inside of all of this.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.120]   Tonight is a little unusual in that a lot of times,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.200]   what we will do is we will try to take a topic
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   and go super heavy application
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   on what it looks like to live this out.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.680]   Tonight's a little bit more of less,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.320]   hey, here's what to do, and here's what to know,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.600]   as we just frame up what the Bible has to say
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.280]   about this unseen world that is there for all of us.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.920]   So we're gonna be Ephesians chapter six,
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.080]   verse 12, we'll dive right in.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.040]   Here's what it says.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.440]   Paul speaking, he's writing to the Ephesian church,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.840]   and he just finished six chapters of a letter
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.680]   where he just walked through,
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.400]   here's what it looks like to live out the Christian faith,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   and then in chapter five,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.800]   he goes into all these different nuances.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.080]   Here's what it looks like to be Christian husbands,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.760]   and then in chapter six, Christians at work,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.720]   and Christians as Christian wives and children,
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.560]   and all these different things,
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.260]   and he says, here's what the church does there,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.560]   and here's the church's enemy,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.640]   and the church's battleground.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.040]   Here's what he says, verse 12.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.840]   For our struggle, or the word is literally
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.280]   like our hand-to-hand combat, our battle,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.360]   is not against flesh and blood.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.920]   It's not against the physical world.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.280]   It's not a battle against the people that live next to you,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   your coworkers, the person in the cube next to you,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   or the apartment above you that annoys you.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.760]   Our flesh and blood is not, Paul says,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.600]   where the battle takes place,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.240]   but it is against the rulers and authorities,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.400]   against the powers of this dark world,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.160]   and against the spiritual forces of evil
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.640]   in the heavenly realm that Paul says,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.120]   hey, look, the battle that you and I as Christians,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.040]   if we engage, I mean, think about how crazy this is.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.360]   He says it's not against flesh and blood.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.840]   It's not against a political party.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.360]   It's not against ISIS.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.040]   It's not against the individuals
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.720]   that you see paraded all over the news.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.120]   It's not against your old boyfriend,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.040]   or your old girlfriend, or whoever in your past
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.000]   betrayed and hurt you.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.360]   He says you and I's battle is against those
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.720]   who are in the spirit, there's these spiritual forces
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.080]   that are in this invisible world,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.920]   but they are impacting the visible world.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.080]   There is a spiritual component to the problems
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.220]   in your life and in my life.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.740]   There is a spiritual dimension to the problems
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.340]   in our country right now.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.320]   I mean, it is crazy.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.640]   If it's your first time back in church in a while,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.960]   and you're like, dude, what is this invisible world?
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.200]   Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.520]   What in the world, where am I right now?
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.760]   (laughing)
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.160]   He is addressing that there is a spiritual dimension
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.840]   to every single problem that you and I face
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.320]   inside of our life, which is crucial.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.000]   He's basically saying, look, you need to understand
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.280]   what the problem is, because if you don't know
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.360]   what the problem is, you can't essentially
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   apply the right solution, right?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.520]   We know this.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.240]   If a person does not accurately understand the problem,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.040]   they cannot accurately diagnose the problem,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.160]   they can't accurately give a prescription
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.600]   or a solution to what's wrong.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.960]   No one would be excited about going to a doctor
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.360]   and going into the waiting room,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.840]   and then waiting and seeing the doctor,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.480]   and you go in there, and you have these symptoms,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.400]   and you're excited, hey, can you give me something?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.880]   And you walk into his office, and he just says,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.640]   man, here, take this prescription, it'll be great.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.040]   Wait, you haven't heard my symptoms.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.680]   Ah, it's kind of one size fits all.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.600]   Which one, you want another one?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.420]   Here you go.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.760]   You would not think that's a good doctor,
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.160]   'cause he doesn't understand the problem.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.720]   And if you do not understand the problem,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.560]   Paul would say, which is why, I mean, think about it.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.560]   Why are you telling them this, Paul?
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.160]   Why are you telling the Ephesian church this?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.440]   Because Paul wants to make sure that they and we
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.840]   understand that the problems that you and I face
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.680]   are much deeper than what you see on the surface.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.440]   There is a spiritual component.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.160]   In other words, the solution that you and I,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.040]   if we're gonna apply a solution to the problems
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.160]   that you and I see in our world,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.720]   it has to involve a spiritual component to things.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.680]   Let me say it another way.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.400]   The problems, let's just take a few of the examples
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   and set up a word.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.440]   We live in a world that thinks if we just educate enough,
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.480]   and if we just give enough time, and enough science,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.920]   and we pass the right laws,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.400]   then a lot of the problems will go away.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.240]   Racism will not go away with enough education,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.120]   and enough time, and enough laws.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   You cannot change the heart by legislation.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.720]   Only the law of love can change the heart.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   There's a spiritual component that has to be changed.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.080]   What happened this weekend in Charlottesville
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.040]   is not something that any legislation can change.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   And it's not, if we take everyone that we think is a racist
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.120]   and we throw 'em in jail and call 'em crazy,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.920]   it will not deal with the problem
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   because evil's gonna manifest itself everywhere.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.320]   There's a spiritual dimension, poverty.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.600]   Education alone will not fix the problem of poverty
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.720]   inside of our country.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.160]   The problem with abortion and the tragedy
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.640]   that it is on our land is not something that will be fixed
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.720]   by enough laws that could be taking place.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.080]   If it was, man, we should all quit
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.560]   and go join the government.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   But even if they pass the law,
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.920]   there's still gonna be segments and places in society
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.000]   where you can go and illegally do it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.360]   The thing that will stop the day that abortion ends
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.640]   in our country will be the day
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.800]   that Jesus captures the heart of people.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.240]   The thing that will end racism inside of the country
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.660]   is not when education finally takes root,
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.440]   it is when Jesus captures the hearts of people.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.860]   The thing that will get rid of ISIS is not a nuclear bomb,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.560]   it will be when Jesus captures the heart of people.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.800]   Paul says if you don't understand the problem,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.520]   you will not apply the right solution.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.080]   There is a spiritual, unseen component
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   that is a part of all the different problems
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.600]   inside of your world.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.720]   The collapse of marriage and the family.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.760]   I read a report today that 57% of parents
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.040]   between the age 26 and 31, millennials,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.160]   57% are single parent wedlock children.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   Those are the babies that are being born.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.100]   That's a majority taking place.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.760]   That is not a problem that will be fixed
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.720]   by more birth control and more education.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.320]   It is a problem that will only be fixed
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.480]   when Jesus captures the heart.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.120]   Paul says do not be fooled.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.280]   There is a spiritual world, an unseen world,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.560]   and it is impacting this world.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.360]   And the victory and change has to include
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   a spiritual component to it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.080]   Our first idea from the text is simply that
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.780]   there is a spiritual realm, Paul says.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.640]   And in addition to that, he then goes on to
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.560]   not only is there this spiritual realm
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.880]   that's influencing and impacting the world
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   in which we live in, but he says this,
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.680]   there is a spiritual reason or an unseen reason
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.280]   for so much of the evil that exists in our world.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.180]   He says this in verse 10, the verse right before it in 11.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.720]   As Paul began to launch into the verse that we just read,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.480]   he says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.180]   "and in his mighty power, and put on the full armor of God
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.100]   "so that you may take your stand
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.060]   "against the devil's schemes."
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.280]   Put on the full armor of God so that you may take
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.640]   your stand against the devil's schemes.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.560]   Paul, are you saying that there's a devil out there
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.760]   that is scheming against me, against the church,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.880]   against Christians, against humanity, against people?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.180]   Yes, he would say.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.520]   There's an unseen reason for the evil inside of our world
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.640]   that you and I see, and it's Satan, it's a devil.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.920]   Jesus would say, and so if you're skeptical,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.120]   like man, is it really a devil?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   Jesus, in John chapter eight, would say that
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   there is a devil who is out there, who is an enemy.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.760]   He's been a murderer from the beginning.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.320]   He wants to murder you.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.280]   He hates you, he's a liar.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.660]   Jesus literally says his only language,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.000]   he's fluent in lying, that's all that he speaks.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.600]   Jesus says there is an enemy, and he's here to kill you,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.040]   he's here to kill anything good about humanity,
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.560]   anything good inside of your life,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.400]   he wants to destroy it, Jesus says,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.960]   that there is a reason for the evil inside of our world,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   and it is ultimately sin and Satan,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.440]   and here we're just discussing Satan,
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.000]   who heads up the spiritual forces of darkness
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.080]   inside of our world, and you may be like,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.600]   man, really, we're talking about the devil?
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   Do we really believe this exists?
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.240]   Because we, less and less, inside of our country,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   people believe it exists.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   Here's what I would say quickly.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.400]   As we've said before, man,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   the reason why I'm convinced there's a devil
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.600]   is because Jesus was, and I'm not the smartest guy
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.440]   in the room, but when a guy can predict
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.640]   his own death and resurrection, and then pull it off,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.080]   I just go with whatever he says.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.360]   I'm like, all right, there's a devil, I'm with him, okay?
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.000]   He said, you know, he died and he came back alive,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.120]   and I can't do it, I'm gonna go with him, all right?
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.360]   Can you do that?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.600]   If so, let's talk afterwards.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.640]   And so Jesus lays out, and so if you're curious,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.680]   if you're like, man, that's crazy,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   the reason we do is because Jesus did.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   And Jesus said there is a reason, and there is an enemy,
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.000]   and a real enemy who hates you,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160]   and he wants to kill anything good inside of your life.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.600]   He does not want you to know God.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.560]   He wants to destroy your dating relationship.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.760]   He wants you to get so addicted to pornography
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   that you cannot look at women without lusting.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.280]   You cannot imagine them without beginning to take
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.120]   and address them in your mind.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   That's what he wants.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.560]   He wants to destroy your dating life
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   so that you date poorly, and then you marry poorly,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.080]   and then he wants you to get a divorce.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.880]   He loves divorce.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.120]   He hates when couples date well.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.360]   He wants to kill anything good in your life.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.680]   He wants you to experience just like an idolatry at work
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.480]   where you begin to get so busy, you're like,
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.280]   man, I just can't really get plugged into church right now
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.560]   because I'm just too busy.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.400]   He hates it when you get plugged into church.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.040]   He hates it when you're in community.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.640]   He hates it when you live in the life.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   He hates it when you live and experience your purpose.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.160]   Like, he wants you to be so busy,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.840]   I really can't serve the church
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.720]   or inside of the city right now.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.240]   I really can't be a part of God's expression of goodness
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.040]   in the city that I live because I'm busy right now
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   trying to build my career.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.800]   Satan loves that.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.880]   Anything he can do to get you off mission.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.360]   If he can't kill you, he will do everything he can
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.640]   to stop you from being effective for Christ.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.840]   And Jesus says he's a murderer, he's a liar,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.120]   and he deceives, he twists things.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.000]   He takes good things and makes them God things.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.240]   He takes things like, man, the gift of marriage,
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   and all of a sudden, he puts that in front of you
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.880]   in a way that you can't think about anything other
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.200]   than when am I gonna get married?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   Every time I get a wedding invitation, I'm ticked.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.960]   I can't believe that they got engaged
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.560]   and they asked me to take the picture.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   Anytime anything like that happens, you're like, great.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.440]   And he says, man, anything I can do,
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.800]   I'm gonna infuse gossip.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.880]   He loves when people gossip.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.320]   He hates when they are lovingly or honestly
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.400]   just are direct and truthful with one another.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.880]   He loves division.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.560]   Jesus says he hates you and he'll do anything he can
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.340]   to distort and just subtly twist things.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.520]   I mean, it doesn't take much to look around at a world
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.800]   and see some of the twisting that's taking place.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.000]   And I'm not trying to get political here,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.280]   but we kinda continue to look at things
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.080]   that seem to be somewhat black and white.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.000]   It could be wrong.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.500]   I don't think I am 'cause the Bible says it.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.360]   But when you look at a man and a woman
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.440]   and people being like, no, doesn't tell the whole story.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.840]   They could've been born with something different.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.440]   We don't really know if that's a man and a woman.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.480]   And so, what do they think?
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.140]   And that's insane.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.920]   And if you don't think that's insane, I understand why.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.360]   Because we live in this world where the prince
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.160]   of the power of the air, which is what the Bible says,
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.880]   has begun to really so convolute the perspectives
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.000]   that even a man and a woman were like, eh, not sure.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.800]   That's insane.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.080]   And it's just twisted.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.240]   Well, how do they feel?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.660]   It's twisted.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.760]   The Bible says that Satan, not only that,
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   he is seeking to ensnare or trap you and me and sin.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.900]   Like, whatever it is.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.680]   It doesn't have to be some extreme, like, hey, man,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.000]   I'm gonna get you addicted on heroin.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.840]   It doesn't have to be that.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.400]   Like, he may just be like, hey, I'm just gonna make you
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.320]   comfortable and so distracted.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.440]   I'm gonna make that relationship you're in so dysfunctional
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   you really can't focus on anyone and anything other
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.560]   than you and your boyfriend.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.380]   Or you and her.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.520]   Hey, I'm gonna make you so, like, insecure about the way
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.160]   that you look that any time you're around people,
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.720]   all you think about is, like, what do they think about me
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.560]   and how do I look right now?
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.400]   And gosh, I'm so insecure or so overly proud of how you look
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.960]   that all you can think about is, I wonder what they think
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.800]   about me?
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.400]   And he'll do whatever he can to trap and ensnare.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.040]   Second Timothy chapter two, verse 26, literally says
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.760]   that the enemy is looking to trap you and I.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.880]   Like, he's setting a trap.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.720]   Think about that.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.840]   Like, a year and a half ago, we lived in this place
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.920]   that had rats inside of it.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   And, like, rats, unbelievably impressive rats.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.080]   Let me just say this.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.160]   They would come into our home at night.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.520]   Like, I'm not saying, like, they're in the attic
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.120]   and we can hear them and it's a little bit like,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.960]   oh, man, they were in our living room.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.840]   They were literally, they would come in at night
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.880]   and we would hear them 'cause they would get in
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.720]   through some of the plumbing, we would hear them out there
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.880]   and they'd go through into the kitchen.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.280]   They would go in, they chewed through the Tupperware
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   that holds the dog food in there.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   And we came through and we saw, like, I know,
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.560]   like, Swarzerat, that's unbelievable.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.120]   And then they'd be gone in the morning, so disgusting.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.160]   So eventually, somebody was like, dude,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.000]   here's what you gotta do.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.600]   You gotta get this trap, it'll get rid of 'em.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.440]   And then once you kill one, you just pull it back,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.080]   put another piece of cheese or food in there
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.320]   and then let it go again.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.560]   And so, little bit of skeptical, ended up going
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.600]   and getting the trap, put it in our house
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.920]   and then set it out and sure enough, man,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.640]   the next day, snap, there was one and it was gone.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.800]   And you come up and it's honestly,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.720]   it's a pretty good feeling.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   I'm not gonna lie to you.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.760]   And there's something about rats
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.440]   where it just doesn't feel bad, you know?
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.120]   Like, you squash a roly-poly, you're like,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   oh, come on, little guy, but a rat, you're like,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   yeah, you deserve this.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.520]   And so, but here's what would always happen.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.720]   Like, you'd think that the other rats would be like,
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.080]   oh man, I saw, you know, cousin Sal die.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.840]   We shouldn't eat the cheese.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.720]   And they would, and they would come
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.800]   and you'd set it out again and sure enough,
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   despite the fact that they just saw, you know,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.720]   whoever get taken out, Aunt Sally,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.840]   just, we lost another one the next day.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.900]   Boom, snapped again.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.000]   The Bible says, like, this is so haunting almost
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.480]   that you and I are the rats and Satan is setting out traps
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.560]   and despite the fact that people see marriages
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.320]   get taken out, they see addictions begin to take place,
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.200]   they see people getting checked into rehab
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.080]   because, you know, they just kind of drank on the weekend
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.960]   and then they couldn't stop.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.460]   One after one, Satan says, man, they see 'em get taken out,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.760]   but I'll take whatever trap I have to
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.640]   'cause they're gonna fall for the bait.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.800]   They're gonna get lured and enticed by their own desires.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.200]   They're gonna take whatever,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.400]   insert, fill in the blank for you what that is.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.040]   Whether it's pride, sex,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.720]   whatever's gonna pull them away from God,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.360]   distract them from the things that really matter.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.280]   Man, I'm gonna set the bait, set the traps.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.840]   And he is doing it and seeking to kill.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.560]   And Jesus says, man, if he cannot kill you
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   and if you're a believer in Christ,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.880]   ultimately your eternal destiny is secure,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.580]   but he will do everything he can to make you less effective
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.720]   and make you experience not hell for eternity,
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.520]   hell on earth and me hell on earth.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.260]   And he is seeking to destroy you and I.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.340]   James, the brother of Jesus,
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.100]   then finishes really our final idea.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.840]   So there's this unseen realm,
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.560]   there's this unseen reason for evil inside of a world,
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.680]   an enemy called Satan.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.960]   And then there's this unseen enemy that is within us.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.840]   James, the brother of Jesus says,
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.760]   he says this in chapter one of James one, verse 14,
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   it says, but each person is tempted.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.840]   So he's going into like,
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.320]   hey, you wanna know how temptation happens
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.480]   in your life and in my life?
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.160]   When you experience temptation, here's what happens.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.880]   When they are dragged away by their own evil desire.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.680]   Wait a second, James, what?
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.360]   Evil desire, that feels a little harsh.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.240]   Yes, every person has an evil desire within them,
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.360]   has evil desires within them.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.800]   The word, and it's not a Greek,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.920]   it's not just this like, oh, they have this one evil desire.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.160]   It's this idea of like, they have this evil, sinful nature
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.560]   that will lure them and entice them away, James says.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.600]   And it's when this happens,
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.720]   that they're beginning to be tempted.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.760]   In other words, when someone's tempted,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.800]   it's because this sinful nature inside of them
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.960]   begins to be appealed or enticed.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.320]   And he says, this is what happens then.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.640]   And then after it's enticed,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.820]   then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.200]   And when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.000]   that James said, what's behind so much of the temptation
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.880]   inside of your life and inside of my life,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.600]   he doesn't even mention the devil.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.040]   Now, Satan may use the sinful nature
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.000]   or evil desires within all of us,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.960]   but he says, you and I have this other enemy
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.760]   that's not outside of us, it's inside of us
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.360]   that is trying to lead us astray.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.080]   And trying, and he says, and if you let it drive the car,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.680]   it's gonna drive you off the road.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.320]   It's gonna drive me off the road.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.400]   That if you and I embrace a lifestyle that,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.920]   man, or just a belief, it's so common of like,
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.600]   do whatever feels good and you do you,
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.880]   and you were born this way.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.280]   When you and I do that, he says,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.680]   you're going to drive your own life off the rails.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.160]   You hurt yourself.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.640]   Our third idea is the unseen enemy within you.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.600]   There's this unseen enemy within you.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.400]   The battle doesn't just take place against,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.440]   the devil made me do it.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.240]   He would say, man, you have an evil desire.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.760]   You have evil desires inside of you.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.960]   There's something just broken
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.160]   that exists inside of you and inside of me.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.460]   It's not dissimilar, like if you've ever driven a car
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.700]   where the alignment is off.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.160]   Maybe some of you drove here tonight,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.860]   your alignment's off, and what happens is it's like,
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.040]   you take your hands off the wheel,
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.360]   you're going out into the next lane, right?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   I mean, the Bible presents this picture of humanity
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.840]   that every single one of us,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   the steering wheel of our heart is broken.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.240]   And James says, if you just allow the heart that you have
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.440]   to drive you wherever it says you should go,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.400]   you will drive yourself off the road and into a ditch.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.120]   You will deceive yourself,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.160]   you will destroy any arena of life
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.320]   where you allow just whatever you feel like
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.720]   to be the deciding factor.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.120]   That you're gonna live a life where you end up
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.160]   being not someone who's in control of it,
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.960]   but being controlled by whatever desires,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.560]   whatever feelings that you have.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.320]   And he says, man, it eventually will bring out death.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.240]   Here's where I think we get stuck, is we're like, dude,
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.160]   wait a second, you're telling me that eventually,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.720]   if sin is there, it conceives, it brings forth death,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.880]   like sin brings death around?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.000]   I feel like, you know, last weekend, and I'm not dead.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.200]   So how is that true?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.480]   Like, I've sinned before, I've clearly sinned before,
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.040]   we all have, and I'm not dead.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.840]   What James lays out, what the Bible teaches is this,
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.920]   and this may bring a lot of clarity for you
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.960]   if you have wondered, that idea of like, sin brings death.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.560]   What the Bible teaches is that sin is like a cancer.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   Sin is like a cancer in that it kills
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.440]   everything that it touches.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.840]   If you allow it inside of your dating life,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.080]   it begins to kill the relationship,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   it begins to kill your own self-worth.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.760]   It begins to manifest in all kinds of these different growths
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.480]   and things like codependency and anxiety and control.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.920]   It begins to spread like an infection,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.640]   that whatever it touches, sin is the reason,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.700]   and if you're like, man, sin brings and kills
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.840]   anything it touches, it killed my parents' marriage.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.000]   Maybe you're like that.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   Sin is the reason why so much of the addiction
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.480]   that is just rampant in our country is taking place.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.320]   Because sin has killed their ability to be self-controlled.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.640]   Sin will kill anything that it touches inside of your life
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.480]   and inside of my life.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.800]   Sin will kill your ability to look at a woman
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.760]   and not undress her in your head.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.080]   Sin will kill your ability to live without alcohol.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.760]   I mean, anything that it touches,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   sin will kill your relationships.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.880]   Sin will kill your friendships.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.640]   Sin wants to kill your friendships.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.880]   And James says, be aware there's an enemy within you
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.900]   that must be kept in check, it must be kept in check,
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.640]   because it is going to hurt and kill you.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.480]   Proverbs 14, 12 says there's a way
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.200]   that seems right to people.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.560]   Like it's a way, they're like, yeah,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.420]   I think this is the way we should go, let's go.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.760]   And in the end, it leads to death.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.080]   It only hurts them.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.640]   I mean, it's not hard to like see this, isn't it?
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.120]   Like think of how many of the behaviors that we do,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.000]   that we do them and we regret them
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.520]   and then we do them again.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.080]   And they're only hurting us.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.920]   Like, man, this is the last time we are not having sex,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.880]   and then you had sex the next weekend.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.640]   Hey, man, this is the last time, you know,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.960]   we're going out tonight, but really,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.520]   I think I'm gonna give up alcohol for, you know,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.400]   the next month, gotta clean it up a little bit.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.200]   And then the next weekend comes, you're like,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.680]   ah, I'm gonna start next weekend.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.060]   And on and on and on, I mean,
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.220]   it's decisions where we like try to take steps
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.060]   in a direction that we know God wants us to move,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.920]   and yet for whatever reason, we talk ourselves out of it.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.380]   Hey, I'm gonna get rid of the computer tomorrow.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.460]   And James says, man, you are,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.900]   if you allow that to control your life,
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.180]   you're headed towards destruction.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.580]   In my own life, I see examples of like how
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.500]   my evil desires within me can manifest and hurt only me.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.920]   We, in the last week and a half, we're like moving.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.640]   We're like in this crazy season right now.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.160]   So we're moving, we're renovating the home
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.540]   that we're living in, so we're living like
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.320]   in boxes downstairs, and then they're renovating
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.360]   the upstairs, and so we're like,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.720]   there's construction workers everywhere,
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.400]   and we're like, I'm gonna change in this closet.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.360]   Okay, there's another construction worker,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.200]   where can I go?
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.880]   And so we're like just in this crazy season,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.400]   and last week specifically, so we moved,
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.620]   and within a week and a half, we moved,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.660]   we got in two wrecks in one day.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.240]   Yeah, yeah, I know, and my wife has gotta learn to drive.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.920]   And I know, one of 'em was me,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.880]   and I know, how crazy is that?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.600]   The same day, hey, I got in a wreck.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.240]   Oh man, I'm so sorry, call back five.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240]   Hey, I got in a wreck.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.800]   Dude, and then we got robbed.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.920]   How crazy is that?
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.400]   Spiritual warfare, unseen, come on.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.480]   And it may be, but all that to say,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.680]   just all this craziness, and here's what happens for me.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.480]   Whenever I get stressed, I get like angry,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.320]   like short, and that may be crazy.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.180]   You're like, huh, I thought pastors were perfect.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.220]   Well, newsflash.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.720]   And this was like last weekend,
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.640]   where my wife and I were discussing things,
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   and she basically was going,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.160]   hey, I feel like I need more ball help with the baby.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.880]   And I was like, I feel like I immediately got angry,
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.040]   immediately got defensive.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.600]   I feel like you don't even know everything
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.120]   that I have going on, and raised my voice,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.680]   yelling at my wife in front of my 20-month-old son.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.460]   Why would I do that?
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.320]   I mean, think about it.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.080]   Like even, so in the moment, it feels good,
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.120]   it feels justified, and I can't believe this.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.280]   And then afterwards, of course, it's like,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.740]   you feel ashamed, you feel embarrassed,
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.040]   you feel just heartbroken.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.200]   And so I looped in community, asked for her forgiveness.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.580]   But think about why.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.080]   Like, why would I, how could that even take place?
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.880]   I mean, out of everyone on the entire planet,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.440]   what could cause and move me towards the person
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.000]   that I love more than anyone else, which is my wife,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.560]   raise my voice and yell in front of a 20-month-old son,
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.840]   and just yell at her in general?
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.600]   I mean, out of the two people inside of the room,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.760]   like, man, there's no one who means more on the planet.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.500]   Like, people, my wife and son, as in like,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.580]   something happens to them, I'm not sure I make it.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.760]   And here I am yelling at them?
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.120]   Because there's something in me, this evil desire,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.800]   that if I allow it to control, I allow it to come out,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.640]   will lead me, it wants to destroy my marriage,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.680]   destroy my future, destroy my son's perspective
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.100]   on what a good father looks like.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.200]   And the same thing exists in you,
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   and wants to come out and destroy
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.640]   any of those different arenas.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.000]   In conclusion, there is, as we just lay the really,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.760]   direction for this first week, there's an unseen world,
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.920]   and it's impacting this one.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   There is an unseen reason for the evil inside of this world,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.840]   and there's an unseen enemy within you,
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.080]   just like it's within me.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.320]   Let me, I'm gonna close right here.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   And I think, as believers, there's this tension,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.520]   because we know that, hey, the battle in Jesus,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.480]   on the cross, there was this victory that was won.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.560]   Like, there was this victory, and Satan ultimately
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.960]   was dealt this fatal wound, and ultimately,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.440]   the victory is ours, and so, you know,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.880]   how do we navigate, and what does that look like,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.480]   and how does that impact the world in which we live?
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.260]   And hasn't Satan been, any power that he has been removed?
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.320]   Here's kinda what I think it's like.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.720]   I heard this story yesterday, and I like,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.000]   spent time on the phone to confirm it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.500]   It's a crazy story.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.440]   And it was this guy who went to Africa,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.000]   and he went on a safari trip to go hunting.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   He was a hunter, and he liked to hunt,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.000]   and he went over to hunt, not like a deer, but a lion.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And he's over there, and he's sitting like,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.200]   hey, you should hunt a lion.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.700]   It's not really relevant to the story,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.800]   whether you should or shouldn't, but he's over there,
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.640]   and he gets a guide, and they're going to hunt the lion.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.400]   And the guide's taking him out, and eventually,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   they find, they see a lion.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.800]   And he takes the gun, and takes a shot.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.400]   And he hits the lion, but he doesn't fall over.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.440]   He just wounds it, and the lion takes off running.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.920]   And they'd been tracking the lion, so they saw his tracks,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.460]   and that's how they had led to him.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.080]   But now, not only do they have the tracks,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   they have the blood, so it should be an easy enough fall.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.800]   So they begin to follow the blood, and follow the tracks,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.520]   and they're following this lion.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.240]   And eventually, as they're going through the path,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.060]   the tracks and the blood stop, and they're like, huh.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.080]   I wonder what could've happened.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.040]   So they begin to continue to look,
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.840]   and they're walking around, and they're just,
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   at this point, trying to just figure out
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.360]   where he possibly could be,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.380]   'cause they don't have a trail to follow.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.480]   And all of a sudden, the guide grabs the guy and says, stop.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.220]   Turn around slowly.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.960]   And they turn around, and there's the lion.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.920]   And the lion begins to charge at them,
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.000]   and the guide's like, hey, I'm not taking any chances,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.080]   whether you can shoot or not.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.440]   You couldn't the first time, so I'm taking the gun,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.600]   and he shoots the lion.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.900]   And the lion dies.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.440]   And they go back, and they retrace their steps,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.740]   and here's what's like the crazy part,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.040]   is they begin to look at the tracks,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.720]   and where the lion had been, and retraced where he went,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.920]   and they realize that at some point,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.560]   they went from being the hunter to the hunted.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.740]   And this thing, even though it had been dealt a fatal wound,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.640]   was no longer something being hunted.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.700]   It was hunting them, and it was gonna take them out.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.360]   The Bible says that when it comes to the enemy
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.840]   that you and I have, which is Satan,
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.760]   and in addition to that, the sinful nature,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.160]   which he uses and plays off of inside of all of our lives,
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.040]   the enemy that's there has been dealt a fatal wound
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.680]   by Christ on the cross, but make no mistake,
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.440]   he will do anything he can to take you out,
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.580]   and to take me out.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.660]   And even though he's got a fatal, hey, I'm gonna die,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   I am hunting you, David, you, porch,
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.240]   and I will do anything that I have to
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.000]   to make sure that your relationship with God suffers.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.400]   You don't even get a relationship with God
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.300]   if you don't know him.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.320]   That's his desire.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.920]   He will do anything to take you and I out
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.000]   because he hates you.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.720]   And just like inside of that story where, in a moment,
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.380]   what allowed the guy, or what allowed the hunter
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.880]   to be protected was the guide said,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.120]   I'm gonna take the gun, and I'm gonna finish it.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.680]   I'm gonna be not only the guide, but the protector,
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.840]   and ultimately, the defeater of the person
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.220]   that's hunting us, so it is with what Jesus has done
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.060]   for us on the cross.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.920]   That's what Christians believe.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.000]   If you are not a Christian, inside of that story,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.040]   you are like the hunter, without a gun,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.000]   and without a guide.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.040]   You do not have the superior Lion of Judah
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.380]   who attacks the lion that comes after, that seeks,
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.580]   the Bible says Satan is like a lion that seeks
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.580]   to devour your life and kill everything inside of it,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.000]   and if you have not trusted in Jesus,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.660]   you do not have that protection.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.240]   The very first, one of the first verses
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.520]   I remember memorizing came from Psalm 91,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.900]   and we're laying in the plain.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.640]   Psalm 91 begins that he who dwells in the shelter
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.200]   of the Most High will abide with the shadow
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.400]   of the Almighty, or abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.240]   Here's what that means.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.860]   He who abides in the shelter, or the protection of God,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.280]   is close, it's like he's under the shadow of his wings.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.240]   In other words, there is protection and proximity to God.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.300]   There is protection and proximity to the Savior, to Jesus.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.880]   Proximity both in terms of trusting and placing yourself
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.400]   under what he did on the cross, dying for you,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   and protection through the relationship
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.000]   that is strong, there's protection and proximity to Jesus,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.200]   and it is in knowing him and walking with him
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.520]   that we have the guide who is there to protect,
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.440]   to show us the way, to guide us in the way
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.080]   that we live our relationships and our dating life
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.700]   and all of these things, and if you have never trusted
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.280]   in Jesus, the very thing that the enemy,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.580]   there is a devil, listen to me right now,
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.640]   I want everybody to come back in,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.920]   especially if you've never put your trust in Christ.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.480]   There is an enemy right now who is doing anything
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.320]   and everything that he can to distract you.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.960]   He's trying to get you to look at the girl next to you,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.200]   he's trying to get you to look at the guy next to you,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.000]   get you to be distracted by the worries
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.300]   of whatever's going on in your life and why,
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.240]   I don't like this guy, what shirt is he wearing up there?
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.800]   He's trying to do anything that he can
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.160]   to get your mind off the fact that God loves you.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.000]   He died on a cross for you.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.220]   Not because you deserve it,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.440]   not because you could ever earn it,
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.240]   because he, being rich and abounding in love,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.680]   the Bible says, looked at the humanity that ran from him
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.840]   and he ran after them and he provided the ultimate sacrifice
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.320]   he jumped in front of the lion of sin and Satan
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.360]   to die in their place, to die for you
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.600]   and here's what the Bible says,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.080]   Satan is blinding you right now.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.920]   I know that sounds crazy and weird,
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.560]   the Bible, 2 Corinthians chapter four, verse four says,
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.720]   the God of this age is blinding people
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.740]   who cannot see the light of Jesus.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.920]   He's blinding the family members and yours and mine
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.200]   that don't know Jesus and when you share the faith
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.680]   or share the gospel, that God doesn't want anything from you
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.840]   but just wants you to accept, my son died on your place
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.900]   and he rose again.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:00.000]   Trust in what he did and when they can't hear it
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.040]   and they don't receive it, it says,
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.360]   Satan has blinded and veiled them
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.060]   and in a moment of faith where they trust in him,
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.400]   they have unveiled faces and they're able to see Jesus
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.560]   as the image of God, as God who he is, the protector,
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.360]   the one who if you dwell in the shelter of protection
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.200]   and the most high, you abide in the shadow of the almighty.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.000]   Let me pray.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.760]   Father, thank you that you are
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:36.560]   superior to any force in this world
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.340]   and that you ultimately have defeated and delivered
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.440]   the final blow to the enemy of the human race
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.160]   and that all who trust and stand with you
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.600]   should be forever protected by their guide and their God
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.200]   and our savior, the Messiah and the king,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.120]   the Lion of Judah who slays the lion that seeks to devour.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:08.840]   Father, I pray, God, would you do something amazing
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.120]   in these next moments and would you open the eyes
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.460]   of people in the room who don't believe, Lord?
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.120]   Father, we as just the followers of Jesus in the room,
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.920]   we acknowledge that there are friends and people
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.400]   in our life that don't know you and we're asking, Lord,
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.360]   we're begging the hounds of heaven to be unleashed
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.840]   and pressed into the hearts of anyone here
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.040]   who doesn't know you and they would accept the free gift
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.520]   that the God who is there provides,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   the free protection that he provides
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.900]   through the provision of what he provided on the cross
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.360]   by dying in their place.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.200]   Father, thank you that you love us in spite of us.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.520]   Would you protect us now and forever from the unseen realm,
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.280]   from the unseen enemy within us.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.680]   We worship you now in song.
