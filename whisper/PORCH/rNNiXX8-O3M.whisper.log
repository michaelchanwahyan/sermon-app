[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.300]   Good evening, it is great to worship with you.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.580]   Welcome, Dallas, welcome, Fort Worth.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.960]   If you're tuning in on podcast or streaming online,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   welcome, those of you who are tuning in around the world.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.260]   It is great to continue in this series in Colossians.
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.660]   And so I thought I'd start this evening
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.040]   by talking about something about a month ago.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.800]   Some of you are gonna be like, was that a month ago?
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.660]   It was a month ago, our world,
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.500]   I was about to say our country,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.960]   our entire world was divided on an issue
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.000]   that we must talk about this evening.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.520]   I mean, it separated people.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.360]   Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.820]   I mean, there was this thing that came out
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.920]   that everyone was like, wait a minute,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520]   and they landed on one side or the other,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.920]   and it divided husband and wife and families
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.520]   and congregations and people.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.400]   And so, let me show it to you.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   There it is.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.180]   There it is, I saw it, I know.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.480]   And so on three, okay,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.040]   we're gonna settle this issue on three, ready?
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.720]   Okay, I want you to scream out what color that dress is.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240]   If you're lost right now,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.120]   you've either been locked in a closet or in some,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.760]   I don't know, and so ask a friend,
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.660]   they're gonna share with you.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.060]   But this dress brought down the internet, okay?
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.800]   Ellen DeGeneres said appropriately,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.720]   Ellen DeGeneres said appropriately
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   that the world will be divided from here on out,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.020]   and I agree with her.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.360]   All right, and so on three,
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.900]   we're gonna yell out what color that dress is, ready?
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.760]   One, two, three.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   (congregation cheering)
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.460]   That is right, it is white and gold.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.160]   (congregation cheering)
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160]   Thank you.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.860]   Just by show of hands,
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.100]   how many of you yelled out white and gold?
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.460]   Okay, okay, now by show of hands,
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.020]   how many yelled out black and blue?
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.580]   Okay, I want all of you who yelled out white and gold
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.060]   to pray for the eyes of those who yelled out black and blue.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.500]   Would you just lay hands on them,
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.700]   and we're gonna pray really for the rest of our time
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.400]   that the Lord would open their eyes,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.200]   that they would no longer be blind.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.940]   I'm sad.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.820]   I'm sad.
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.660]   I used to be a Taylor Swift fan.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   So she tweeted this.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.500]   This was Taylor Swift's tweet.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   She said, "I don't understand this odd dress debate,
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.240]   "and I feel like it's a trick somehow.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.720]   "I'm confused and scared.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.980]   "P.S. it's obviously black, or blue and black."
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.080]   (congregation cheering)
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.600]   And I was scared too, and honestly, what I thought,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.440]   here's what I thought,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.020]   like I just, just in moment of transparency,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.700]   I'm like, this is a trick that the entire world is on.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.220]   I felt like I was on the Truman Show or something.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.260]   I'm like, okay, it's gotta be white and gold.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.880]   I don't see anything that could remotely
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.160]   be interpreted as black and blue,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.740]   and so all of these people saying black and blue,
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.660]   they're playing a trick on me, and they're all in on it.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.360]   David Marvin's in on it too, and I'm just,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.580]   I'm frustrated by that.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.120]   I really am wondering, I'm like, I see,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.780]   I'm like, Taylor Swift's in on it somehow.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.700]   David, talk to Taylor.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.200]   How did this happen, you know?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.340]   And it just, it really did divide people,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.740]   and I don't know if you, like, we were talking about it,
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.820]   and we were getting fired up.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.220]   It was like, no, no, you know, clearly,
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.780]   they did a RGB kind of red, green, blue
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.460]   computer experiment in the color,
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.740]   and the breakdown, and you don't understand the science,
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.760]   and I don't, you know, and people are like,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460]   oh, well, the lesser smart people said,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.940]   and you know, and everyone's kind of,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.580]   it becomes competitive, and it really did.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.220]   It divided people, and it was fun just, you know,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.860]   the Twitter traffic that was out there and whatnot,
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.780]   and so tonight, we're gonna talk about something else
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.860]   that divides people.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640]   We're talking about this idea of who is Jesus.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.420]   You came into the room this evening
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.380]   with some idea of who Jesus is,
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.700]   and I'm gonna show you tonight from the scripture
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.540]   that I think a small of us, maybe a minority of us
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.940]   in the room actually understand who Christ is,
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.260]   who he desires to be in our life,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.040]   but we all, everyone here has to answer this question,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   who is Jesus?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.260]   It's the same question that the Church of Colossae
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.540]   was asking, who is Jesus?
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.380]   It's the same reason Paul wrote this letter.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.500]   Hey, I wanna set it straight for you guys.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.340]   I want you to understand who Christ is.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.100]   Stop adding to him, stop changing him,
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.220]   stop making him out to be something
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.720]   that he was never meant to be,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.940]   but you wanna divide a room.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.140]   I mean, people will talk about God.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.340]   Even atheists will tolerate your conversations about God,
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.660]   but when you start talking about Jesus,
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.780]   you start talking about the way, the truth, and the lie,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.220]   well, that's exclusivity, that's rude, I can't believe you,
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.920]   and all of a sudden, it gets uncomfortable.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.420]   It's divisive.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.780]   It's divisive,
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.420]   and so we're asking this question this evening.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.940]   This is the topic, the subject, who is Jesus?
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.480]   The Muslim says he's a prophet like Abraham and Moses,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.340]   and a lesser prophet than Muhammad.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.420]   The Jehovah's Witness says he was Michael the archangel
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.660]   who came to earth and left his angelic being
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.980]   as he was born of a woman,
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.300]   and then he was fully man, named Christ.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.220]   The Mormon says that God and Mary had a sexual relationship
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.380]   and Jesus was their son, and if you do good things,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.500]   that you too can be like Jesus,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.700]   a child or son or daughter of God,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.420]   and the liberal theologian says that he was a good teacher,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.240]   maybe even that he was a way to God.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.180]   He had some good understandings,
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.220]   and I will tell you the reason I start with that,
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.060]   that dress picture, because for most of my life,
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.140]   before I became adult, as I was going to church,
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.980]   that's what I thought.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.060]   I thought, hey, this is this kind of superstitious thing
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.140]   that we all come into the room
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.300]   and we all kind of pretend like Jesus is God,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.140]   and we're even gonna talk to the air,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.940]   and we're all gonna kind of get emotional
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.700]   about this idea of God,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.740]   but we all kind of know he doesn't exist.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.300]   And people were talking about a relationship with Christ,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.660]   and I was like, yeah, I wonder,
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.180]   can I have a relationship with Christ?
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.300]   But then in my heart, I'm like, hey, we all know
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.140]   you can't have a relationship with someone you can't see
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.760]   or talk to or touch or hug.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.240]   And I'm here tonight to tell you that I've experienced that.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.100]   Maybe that's where you're at, but you can.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.240]   That in fact, life is found in him alone.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.820]   There is no life apart from him,
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.500]   and so if you're here and you don't have him,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.140]   you're experiencing some kind of lesser life.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.420]   And so what we're gonna do this evening
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.140]   is we're gonna divide the room, okay?
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.660]   I think we'll start with, hey, have you heard of Christ?
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.100]   And I think all of our hands would go up.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.220]   We've all, yeah, Jesus, we all heard about Jesus,
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.020]   but as we begin to talk about who he is,
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.040]   I think more and more,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.700]   you're gonna start disagreeing with me.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.660]   And maybe you won't publicly,
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.900]   but in your heart and in your mind,
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.020]   you're gonna think, no, I don't know
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.540]   that I would be in that group.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.580]   And as we go further, you might say,
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.820]   well, no, I was in that last group.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.860]   I don't know that I'd be in that group.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.940]   For when we end tonight from the Scriptures,
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.740]   sadly, and I hope I'm wrong,
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.120]   there might be a minority of us who actually agrees
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.980]   with who Jesus is and who he desires to be in our life.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.020]   This passage in your Scripture
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.940]   is called the supremacy of Christ.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.020]   It's a word we don't use often.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.260]   Supremacy is defined as the state of being highest
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.780]   in rank or authority, paramount, sovereign, chief.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.300]   This is who Jesus wants to be in your life.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   Let me say it to you again.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.460]   Highest rank or authority, paramount, sovereign,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.220]   chief over your life.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.180]   Because here's what I'm certain of, guys.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.080]   100 years from now, I mean 100 years from today,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.420]   we're all, every single person in this room
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.140]   is going to realize that the single most important question
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.740]   you were asked as you walked on this planet was,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.100]   "Who is Jesus?"
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.140]   And that's why this passage in the Scripture
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.160]   is so important because it answers it with great clarity.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.740]   I don't know that there's any other passage in Scripture
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.780]   that more heresies have come from.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.440]   As people read this and misunderstand what it actually is,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.980]   it's a song that the Apostle Paul wrote down in Colossians.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.560]   Most commentaries would agree that this is actually a song.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.140]   And he wrote for the purpose of explaining who Jesus was
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.940]   so that the Colossians would know,
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.220]   the church in Colossae would know and understand.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.180]   And so just to show you where Colossae is,
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.580]   here's a picture that it's an actual place on the planet.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.500]   It is the southwest corner of what is modern day Turkey.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.420]   And they have been told, the people there
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.900]   that Paul is writing to have been told
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.620]   that Jesus isn't enough, that his grace isn't enough.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.180]   And so David very appropriately talked about last week
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.540]   how it's not just grace that saves us,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.340]   but it's grace that actually changes us.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.700]   And this week we're going to talk about who this man,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.600]   Jesus, is as they were attempting to redefine him then.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.520]   And your peers, friends, coworkers, family members,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.040]   and people you know are attempting to redefine him today.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.020]   So let's dive in, Colossians chapter one still.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.620]   If you're just joining with us,
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.060]   this is a series we started last week.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.220]   You came at a great time.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.340]   If you're looking for it in your Bible,
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.900]   it's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the Gospels,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.380]   Acts, Romans, first and second Corinthians,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.060]   Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.700]   So you don't need to be nervous if you pass it up
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.340]   or wondering if anybody's watching you
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.300]   and you don't know the Bible.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.540]   It's okay, we're glad you're here.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.100]   You can take time to find that.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.980]   Verse 15.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.820]   The son is the image of the invisible God,
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.740]   the firstborn over all creation.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.540]   He begins to talk about Christ.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.940]   And he's not saying that he looks like God physically,
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.180]   he is saying that he is the exact representation
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.140]   of God's character as he walked on this earth.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.540]   If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.460]   If you want to know how God would handle the sick,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.020]   look at how Jesus handled the sick.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.900]   If you want to look at how God handles sinners,
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.560]   look at how Jesus handles sinners.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.660]   This Jesus is the exact representation
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.140]   of the character of God,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.140]   the visible image of the invisible God.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.100]   And when it says firstborn over creation,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.940]   that doesn't mean that Jesus was born first,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.020]   as Jehovah's Witness might tell you.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.080]   That means that that term firstborn
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.420]   is a term of inheritance to the Jewish culture
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.020]   that this was written to.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.720]   It means that all of creation belongs to Jesus.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.780]   The next line is actually going to give us that context.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.580]   For in him all things were created,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.980]   things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.340]   whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.500]   all things have been created through him and for him.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.700]   Everything you know was made by Jesus for Jesus.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.280]   John 1 tells us that he was there in the beginning.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.960]   He was not created.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.340]   John 3:16 says that for he was God's only begotten,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.920]   not born, not made son.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.980]   That he is God.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.320]   That he was there with God in the beginning,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.680]   the beginning of the beginning,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.920]   as we understand the beginning, he was there.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.840]   And so anyone or anything that you're tempted to worship
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.200]   was made by Jesus for Jesus.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.480]   Just imagine with me for a second,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.900]   I don't know who you would get,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.880]   it would be a big deal to me, you know, for you.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.820]   You know, if you're out at dinner with someone
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.360]   and a celebrity walks up,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.600]   I don't know who's a big deal to you.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.680]   I don't know if it's Tony Romo
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.760]   or Prince William or something.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.600]   I don't know, right?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.900]   Who is a big deal?
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.440]   You're sitting there and maybe you would call your friends
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.280]   or post on Facebook,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   you won't believe what just happened to me.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.460]   You won't believe who just paid my bill.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.520]   Prince William walked up and he just paid the bill.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.840]   It was a big, I was nervous.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.000]   I couldn't even speak.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.800]   I tried to speak and words didn't come out.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.640]   I was sweating.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.460]   I was like, are you serious?
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.960]   I can't believe you're here in Dallas.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.360]   Check this out.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.760]   The most powerful being in the entire universe
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.720]   paid your eternity, paid your bill for eternity.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.200]   He desires to know you, he loves you.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.920]   He's seeking you, he's pursuing you,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.780]   and he's created you, he's invented you for a purpose.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.360]   It's a bigger deal than anyone that you could imagine.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.800]   Anyone you would meet was actually created by him.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.200]   He knew Prince William in his mother's womb.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.040]   He know how many hairs are on his head.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.160]   A billion years ago, he knew Prince William.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.360]   He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.940]   This is really relevant to the people of Colossae
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.800]   because there were a lot of earthquakes there
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.480]   and they were tempted to worship mother earth
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.160]   or mother nature, if you will.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   And so I remember when I went to Haiti
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.880]   just after the earthquake in Port-au-Prince,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.080]   they said the entire nation began to turn to God
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.000]   because they said only God can shake the earth like this.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.880]   It was just a layup to share the gospel.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.980]   Hey, this is, you know, God is not shaken.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.120]   In fact, God holds all things together.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.360]   Can I tell you about who he is?
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.880]   And that's what he's writing here.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.640]   And he is the head of the body, the church.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.600]   This is why we write about membership
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.560]   or talk about membership so much here
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.080]   because we want you to belong to the church.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.920]   In fact, the only way to be under Christ's authority
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.880]   is to be in his church and belong to his church.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.720]   So you're here and you're wondering,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   hey, I wonder if I'm under Christ's authority.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.500]   Well, do you belong to his church?
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.800]   Okay, that's step one of being under his authority
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.640]   after you've trusted him for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.500]   He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.800]   so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.320]   We don't use that word much, supremacy,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.160]   but it's a huge word.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.200]   In fact, this passage is often titled with it.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.520]   And so do you guys remember born identity?
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.300]   Jason born and he kind of identifies himself as bad.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.520]   And then born supremacy comes out and he is amazing.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.680]   Like he's just showing off how bad he actually is.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.560]   This is what's going on.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.400]   God is bigger and better and badder and faster
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.420]   and more amazing than anything.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.220]   For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.480]   Paul is answering a question, a very important question
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   that you're gonna have to answer tonight.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.360]   Who is this man?
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.680]   This is a question that shows up all throughout scripture.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.480]   Who is this man?
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.240]   Where everywhere Jesus would go, people were,
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.360]   it says in Matthew that when he came into a town,
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.240]   everyone was asking, who is this man?
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.520]   Remember in Mark four, when Jesus is with his boys
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.360]   and they're on a boat and he's sleeping
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.120]   and the storm comes and all of a sudden,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.480]   all of these grown fishermen who have spent most
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.660]   of their life on the sea are terrified.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.180]   These grown men are like afraid.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.160]   They think they're gonna die,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.920]   get thrown overboard and drown.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.560]   And they go to Jesus and they wake him up
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.160]   and they say, how can you sleep at a time like this?
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.680]   Do you not care?
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.560]   And he gets up, he's like tired, hush.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.520]   I would've told them to hush.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.000]   You know, I would've been like, what are you talking about?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.200]   But he just goes, hush.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.420]   And the storm calms and you know what they ask?
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.860]   They say, who is this man that even the wind
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.060]   and waves obey him?
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.240]   This man is God.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.040]   That's my first point, Jesus is God.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.320]   Jesus is God.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.800]   Jesus is the second person of the Trinity.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.280]   And so I assume that, now I just lost some of you,
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.840]   but most of you are still with me.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.240]   Most of you would agree, yeah, Jesus is God.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.360]   And so we may have just lost a few people
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.340]   on that first point, but I think most of you
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.360]   are still with me right now.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.240]   You're like, yeah, I think Jesus is God.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.800]   It's a really basic concept of the Christian faith.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.760]   This is something that we would break fellowship with.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.320]   If somebody said, hey, I don't think Jesus is God,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.240]   we'd say, hey, we can be friends, we can hang out,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.760]   but we can't worship together
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.560]   because we're not worshiping the same God.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.120]   You would say, hey, we can't get married.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.440]   Like, I can't spend the rest of my life with you
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.920]   because 2 Corinthians 6, 14 says,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.080]   do not be unequally yoked.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.440]   And if I believe Jesus is God
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.980]   and you don't believe Jesus is God,
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.360]   we are certainly unequally yoked at this point.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.920]   And so this is a really big idea.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.800]   It is a huge idea that Jesus, we just identified God,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.440]   the creator of the heavens and the earth, as Jesus.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.760]   Now, some of you, you're like, duh, okay, Pastor Man,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.240]   thank you for that huge, big, lofty idea,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.040]   Jesus is God, great point there.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.200]   Okay, but here's the deal.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.520]   It's a big idea that we've become accustomed to
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   that no longer has impact on our lives.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.840]   Let me explain like this.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.920]   There's a town near where I'm from called Luling,
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.160]   Luling, Texas, and anybody from Luling?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.200]   Good, 'cause I'm about to offend you if you were.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.900]   And so Luling smells awful.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.740]   When you drive through it
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.400]   because of the oil and gas that's there,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.280]   like, you can smell it from miles away
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.000]   and you pull in, and we used to play basketball there,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.480]   and you're like, oh, how am I ever gonna be able
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.760]   to play basketball here?
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.000]   Like, that was our excuse for losing.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.880]   We're like, oh, 'cause it stinks, right?
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.280]   And you're like, I could never ever live in this town,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.380]   it smells so awful.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.760]   But here's the deal.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.080]   Within 30 minutes, you would get used to it
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.360]   and you would no longer think about it.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.680]   And at one point in your life, Jesus is God was a huge idea.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.700]   I just met God.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.000]   God wants a relationship with me.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.600]   And now it's like, duh, what does that even mean?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.160]   Jesus is God, who cares?
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.720]   And so I don't know if you've been to Luling.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.680]   Maybe you've been to Lubbock, I hear it's similar.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   But. (congregation laughing)
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:03.360]   I had family members that this was a big deal for.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.240]   I mean, people who were really close to me said,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.640]   man, I believe Jesus was God's son.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.400]   I believe he was a way-shower.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.340]   I believe he was an example.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.600]   I don't think he was God.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.880]   And so after I became a Christian,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.480]   we'd have to sit and we'd have to talk through that.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.920]   And by the grace of God, he's since changed their mind
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.080]   through years of conversation
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.200]   and a movement of his Holy Spirit.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   But this can be a big deal.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.480]   I mean, this can really separate things.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.920]   The world belongs to Jesus as God.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.000]   Abraham Kuyper says this, one of my favorite quotes,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.560]   says, "There is not a square inch in the whole domain
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.300]   "of our human existence over which Christ,
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.260]   "who is sovereign over all, does not cry out, mine."
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.960]   Every square inch of creation is his.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.040]   Now this is like my son, Weston, my two and a half year old,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.520]   everything is his, right?
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.400]   He's like, "Mine, mine, mine,"
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.160]   except for what Jesus actually is.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.760]   When he says, "Mine," it's his.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.220]   It was created by him and for him.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.560]   And so he's not, doesn't just bear the image of God,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.040]   he has the power of God, the fullness of his deity
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.120]   and dwells in Christ.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.560]   So the other day we were praying at night
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.280]   with my little girls, Presley and Finley,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.920]   and I said, "Presley, do you wanna pray?"
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.760]   And she said, "Yeah."
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.280]   And she started kinda playing, rolling her eyes,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.560]   like, ♪ Dear God, dear God ♪
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.040]   And she's kinda singing, ♪ Dear God ♪
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.740]   And I said, "Hey, time out real quick, sweetie.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.500]   "Hey, do you understand that you're talking
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.340]   "to the creator of the heavens and the earth?
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.640]   "Like, do you know that he could suck all the air
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.120]   "out of the room right now?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   "That in a moment, like just with a blink,"
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   stay with me, stay with me.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.880]   I said, "Just with the blink of his eyes,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.480]   "he could kill you right now."
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.160]   I feel a lot of judgment going on.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.280]   Most of you aren't parents, you don't know, it's hard, man.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.960]   Sometimes stuff just comes out and you're like,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.840]   "Okay, yeah, she didn't sleep that night, that's okay.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.400]   "She has a better understanding of who God is."
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.880]   She literally, she was like.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.820]   I said, "But he probably won't, it's okay.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.160]   "He probably won't, he probably, you know,
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.660]   "he'll probably let you live."
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.720]   It's a humbling thing to realize that someone is powerful.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.800]   Because when you realize the power of someone else,
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.760]   you understand your place.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.320]   I mean, have you ever come across someone powerful?
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.600]   In my high school, there was this dude, he was 6'2".
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.400]   He was an incredible athlete.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.320]   I mean, he could just monster dunk the ball.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.920]   He played football, basketball, track, baseball, everything.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.680]   He was that guy, and like his arm, he was 6'2",
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.960]   his arms were like my legs, like huge,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.480]   just big arms, walk around.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.360]   He was a nice guy, his name was Kiki.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.760]   He had a gold grill.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.120]   It said K-I-K-I right there.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.120]   And it was known, I'm serious, it was known,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.920]   Kiki was a friend, it was known you don't mess with Kiki.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   Like, Kiki would whoop anybody.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.080]   It was just known throughout school.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.560]   Like, he was king of the school, right?
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.440]   I remember one particular day, this guy had talked
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.400]   to his girlfriend or something,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.560]   and he was a nice guy, by the way.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   He'd be like, "What's up, JP, how you doing, man?"
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.240]   He was just kind of, everybody loved Kiki.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.040]   And so he, this guy had talked to his girlfriend,
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.320]   he came up to him, he said, "Hey, what's up?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.480]   "We walked in the locker room, I remember."
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   He said, "What's up?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.160]   "Hey, what's up, man?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.000]   "Hey, I saw you, you know, I heard you talking to my girl."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.680]   And the guy was like, "Yeah?"
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.880]   And he goes, "Cool, man."
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.040]   Hey, anybody else wanna talk to my girl?
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.440]   Everybody was like, "Oh, man, what girl?"
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.160]   And so it was known that Kiki was a good wrestler.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.680]   And so one time he was at my house,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.120]   and I like to wrestle, and I said,
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.400]   I said, "Hey, man, I mean, you know,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.520]   "I hear you're a good wrestler."
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.480]   I was like, "Let's wrestle."
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.800]   And he said, "Nah, bro, you don't wanna do that."
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.320]   And I said, "No, I think I do, let's wrestle."
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.480]   And I don't really know what happened, okay?
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.680]   But I remember somebody else being there,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.240]   and they said, "Okay, go."
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.640]   And all of a sudden, he had me like this above his head,
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.280]   and then on the ground, and that's where I woke up.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   And it's a humble thing being there,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.120]   and like, oh, oh, you're that powerful.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.200]   Oh, like everything they said about you is true, all right?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.040]   Now, I'm not, you know, God made Kiki in his mother's womb.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.280]   Like, that's who we're talking about here.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.600]   And there needs to be a moment
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.760]   where we understand his power in our place.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.720]   He's God, we're not.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.680]   He controls everything, we control nothing.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.840]   All power and honor and glory is his.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   You can imagine if he wasn't a good God,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.960]   that wouldn't be good for any of us.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.520]   But the scripture says he's a great God,
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.320]   and he displayed his greatness in the gospel
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.000]   that while you were yet sinners, he gave his life for you.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.720]   That's a beautiful, beautiful reality.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.000]   In the same way that I wanted to be on Kiki's good side
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.280]   at that moment, we wanna be on God's good side,
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.880]   not out of threat or fear, but because he's a good God,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.440]   but he's also a powerful God.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   And through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.480]   whether things on earth or things in heaven,
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.260]   by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.160]   Once you were alienated from God
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.720]   and were enemies in your minds
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.960]   because of your evil behavior,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.880]   but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.720]   through death to present you holy in his sight
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.000]   without blemish and free from accusation.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.080]   That's good news.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   And so Paul is answering the question, who is this man?
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.000]   Jesus, who is this man?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.680]   And you may remember this story of these guys
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.560]   who had this friend who was paralyzed,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.080]   and Jesus is healing people on the earth.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.000]   And so they carry this man on a mat who can't walk,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.520]   and they try to carry him up to Jesus,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.600]   but the crowd is too dense, it's too thick.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.560]   And so they climb up on top of the roof,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   and they lower him down in faith in front of Jesus.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.320]   And do you know what Jesus says?
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.640]   He says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.060]   And do you know what the Pharisees said?
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.200]   They said, "Who is this man?"
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.600]   That's the question.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.160]   Who is this man that he thinks that he can forgive sins
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.640]   because only God can forgive sins?
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.720]   Now, we've already established Jesus is God,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.480]   but not only is he God,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.460]   he's the one who can forgive your sins, Jesus.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.660]   My second point, Jesus is the Savior.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.360]   Jesus is the Savior.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.680]   Now, the group just got a little smaller,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.320]   because by being the Savior, it means he's the way to God,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.360]   and by being the way to God,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.640]   it means he's the only way to God.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.400]   Now we've become exclusive in nature,
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.120]   and this makes people uncomfortable.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.080]   And so now I just lost some of the room.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.240]   The room just got smaller.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.640]   Like maybe we're just right about here,
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.600]   and everyone over there is like,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.960]   "Yeah, I believe in Jesus, he's a good idea,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.320]   "but don't say he's the only way 'cause that's offensive."
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.040]   Problem with that is that's what the Scripture says.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.960]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.160]   To reject that truth is to reject the entire book,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.440]   and really to deny the gospel in and of itself.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.740]   Because if God did, if there was another way,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.000]   then God wasted his death.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.380]   Like that was a foolish plan.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.000]   If there's any other way to God,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.960]   then I think the part where he goes and is tortured
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.700]   and crucified for my sins was really foolish.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.080]   Should've went some other way, right?
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.940]   Like that seems really costly.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.320]   But a loving God says, "No, that while you are yet sinners,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.140]   "I did that for you because I love you
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.320]   "as an act of love for you."
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   And so we've already established that God is powerful.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   So who is an enemy to a God that is that powerful?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.400]   You were.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   Says you were his enemies.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.840]   That you were alienated from him
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.240]   because of your evil behavior.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.200]   And a lot of people read that and they're like,
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.340]   "Wait a minute, that's not talking about me.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.400]   "Like come on, evil behavior.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.860]   "I mean, I stole that pack of gum one time,
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.480]   "but really evil behavior."
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.440]   And the problem with that is if we don't understand
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.520]   our need for a savior, then we don't get a savior.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.840]   Because only people who need a savior receive a savior,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.200]   and Jesus is a savior, that's his job description.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.600]   Really, we're just going down his resume right here, right?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   Creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.360]   visible image of the invisible God.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.660]   I save people, that's what I do, I'm a savior.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.500]   If we don't need a savior, then why would you need Jesus?
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.660]   It's talking about you and me here
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.360]   when it says by your evil, right?
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.760]   Let's see, once you were alienated from God
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.320]   and were enemies in your minds
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.360]   because of your evil behavior.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.160]   Alienated from God literally means under another authority.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.040]   Did you guys have ISS in high school, in school suspension?
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.800]   Yeah, me too, I spent some time there.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.420]   And so it was like this other room, right?
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.480]   You would walk by, there was an outside corridor,
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.460]   and you would walk by and in that room,
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.960]   those were the guys who were alienated
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.100]   from the rest of the good people.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.160]   They were the people who said,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.760]   "Hey, we will not be under the authority of the school."
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.280]   And they made decisions that got them in another room.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   In fact, it was like, "Hey, you won't be here long.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.120]   "We know it's only a matter of time
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.980]   "before you're shipped off somewhere else
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.620]   "and you won't graduate with us.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.640]   "You've been alienated, you've been separated."
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.480]   Once you were separated from God
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.380]   and Jesus had to purchase you back.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.840]   See, God can make peace.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.860]   It says he's made peace by bloodshed on his cross.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.260]   God can make peace in two ways.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.700]   There's two ways to make peace with your enemies.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.840]   One, you can abolish them, right?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.160]   You can just wipe them out.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   They no longer exist, they're not your enemies anymore.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.700]   They don't exist.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.140]   In other words, you can make them your friends.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.220]   God prefers that method.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.860]   It says in the scriptures really clearly,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.580]   God loves you so much that while you were an enemy,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.420]   he attempted to make you a friend
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.740]   by giving his own life on behalf of you.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.480]   That happened in an event that really
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   the whole world acknowledges that it happened,
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.280]   that Jesus died.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.080]   That something really significant happened on the cross.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.220]   And God says, "Hey, I wanna bring peace to this earth
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.940]   "and reconcile all things by one of two ways,
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.960]   "by making my enemies friends or by wiping them out,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.500]   "but I'd certainly prefer the first way.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.660]   "But I will make peace.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.100]   "Peace will be made."
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.600]   And so Jesus' skills and capabilities are simply
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.000]   he makes God not angry.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.280]   I mean, the gospel, it's another one of those big ideas
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   we just kinda get accustomed to.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.600]   I mean, do you guys realize what the gospel says?
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.040]   Can you imagine just the weight of this,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.620]   that God's son died on your behalf,
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.160]   that he endured the punishment that you deserve?
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.020]   Like, let's just imagine this with me for a second.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.860]   Like, I'm driving down the road in my truck
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.700]   with my son Weston.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.760]   Weston loves my truck.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.520]   He's always like, "Daddy's truck, let's go for a ride."
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.280]   He's two and a half years old, he's in the back.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.920]   I'm driving down the road and let's just say,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.160]   "You run a red light, you hit my truck."
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.960]   Now, let's just say, because I love my truck
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.240]   and let's just say I'm really materialistic
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.640]   and I'm not in the spirit in this moment.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.960]   And so I'm like burning with anger towards you.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.560]   Like, I'm about to go kiki on you, right?
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.400]   And so I get out of the car and I grab my son Weston
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.200]   and I look at you and my anger towards you
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.640]   and I just start beating him.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.120]   Graphic, huh?
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.080]   It ain't nearly as graphic as what happened on your behalf.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.440]   That Jesus absorbed the wrath of the Father on the cross.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.320]   Every sin you've ever committed was against God.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.400]   Every time, you slept with his daughter, right?
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.520]   You looked at his daughter, right?
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.680]   You purchased idols in front of him.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.800]   That time you abused your body in that way,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.320]   that wasn't a sin against yourself,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.640]   it was a sin against God Almighty,
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.760]   creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.800]   And he hates your sin, but he loves you so much.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.560]   He says, "Jesus will die in your place."
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.760]   Now, the illustration breaks down because it's not just that,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.280]   it's that it says, "Jesus,"
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.160]   this is the complication of the Trinity,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.080]   "that Jesus himself is God."
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.120]   And so it's like he runs in between the vehicles,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.640]   absorbs the wrath of this car
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.440]   so that I'm no longer angry, right?
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.560]   But it says that he does that
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.440]   for every sin you've ever committed,
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.280]   that he absorbed the wrath of the Father,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.080]   God's anger at your sin on your behalf,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.400]   past, present, and future,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.560]   so that you might be a child of God,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.160]   so that you might be reconciled to the Father,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.960]   with him forever in peace,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.720]   that his anger is not at you,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.960]   that his anger was satisfied fully
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.240]   by Christ's blood shed on the cross.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.600]   It says, "For the joy set before him, Jesus did this."
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.880]   God is in love with you,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   that while you were an enemy, he died for you.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:59.040]   "If you continue in your faith, established and firm,
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.160]   "and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel,"
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.280]   we hate that if, it feels conditional,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.980]   it's like, okay, here we go, now I gotta do something.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.400]   I wanna show you what that if is pointing to.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.760]   It's the last word in that sentence,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.720]   "If you continue in your faith, established and firm,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   "and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel."
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.640]   This is not a if you do if,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.400]   this is an if you believe if.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.860]   But if you believe, you do.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.280]   Do you track it with me?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.200]   This if here, it's not an if you do,
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.400]   like, here's what I want you to do
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.160]   so that you can be reconciled to God.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.720]   This is a, here's what you believe,
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.800]   you hold out to the hope that is held out for you
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.640]   in the gospel.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.460]   What is the gospel?
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.720]   The gospel is that God saved you in spite of you,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.680]   that against your will, God took you in,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.760]   that while you were yet enemies of God, he died for you.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   Christ, Jesus, died for you in spite of you.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.680]   For it is by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.720]   and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.480]   not by works so that no one can boast.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.240]   This is the gospel that you heard
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.320]   and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.980]   and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.080]   What I want you to do there
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.600]   is I want you to write your name in that blank.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.760]   Of which I, blank, have become a servant.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.960]   Go Taylor Swift on 'em.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.480]   Of which I, JP, have become a servant.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.280]   My third and final point is Jesus is Lord
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.600]   and we are his servants.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.400]   Jesus is Lord and we are his servants.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.640]   He is our master.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.700]   Man, I just lost a lot of you.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.200]   You tracking with me?
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.520]   Jesus is God, sure, okay.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.880]   Jesus is Savior, sure, fire insurance,
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.480]   I don't wanna go to hell, he's my Savior.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   Jesus is master.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.400]   You don't go where he doesn't send you.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.280]   He's driving, you're not driving.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.840]   He's your master, he's your Lord.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.580]   Now I'm not talking about Lordship salvation,
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.280]   if you're familiar with that term.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.120]   I'm not saying that you're saved if Jesus is Lord.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.440]   You're saved by what Jesus did, that's a fact.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.460]   But you will not experience life on this earth
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.240]   as it was intended to be experienced
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.360]   if Jesus is not Lord of your life.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.760]   If you are not his servant, if he's not in control,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.960]   if you're fighting an almighty, powerful God for control,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.000]   then you're really gonna struggle in this life.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.680]   Life is going to be very, very difficult for you
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.080]   and you will not experience Christianity
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.960]   as it was intended to be experienced.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.400]   And I can tell you that from experience.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.580]   I mean, that's my story.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.760]   When I came to a place where I knew Christ,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.100]   there were things I was holding onto.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.680]   There was the language and the pornography
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.400]   and the sex and the drinking that I didn't wanna give up.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.600]   The getting drunk, the partying
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.920]   that I didn't wanna give up.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.640]   The materialism that I didn't wanna give up.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.560]   And have a foot in both worlds, which is miserable.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.840]   You lose out on both worlds.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   One foot in the church, one foot in the world.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.240]   Not getting the best from either.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.000]   And so Jesus is Lord and we are his servants.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.840]   He is our master.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.840]   This is Paul's DTR, right?
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.200]   He's defining the relationship.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.680]   Are you familiar with that term, DTR?
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.880]   Define the relationship.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.400]   You ever done that?
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.720]   Is it not a game changer?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   Like in the midst of spending time with someone.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.560]   Like you have this conversation.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.520]   I mean, do you remember, has that ever happened to you?
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.360]   Like you're sitting there and it's like,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.120]   hey, I wanna talk to you about something.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.520]   I remember Ann Marie back in the day,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.600]   like her hands right here, my hands here.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.760]   You're kind of like slowly inching over that pinky.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.640]   You know, I'm sweaty.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.600]   I'm like, oh man, I'm nervous.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.040]   Like, hey girl, thought I had game.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.320]   You know, I'm like, so everybody's asking what we are.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.080]   Man, I think we need to figure that out.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.200]   Let's give the people what they want, you know.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   Before that it was like check yes or no.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.680]   Now I remember Kelly crawled over the console in my car.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.960]   She's like, hey, I love you.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.720]   I was like, thank you.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.040]   Those conversations, they go,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.920]   they take you separate ways, right?
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.400]   That like, that takes you one way or another way.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.760]   Like, okay, one minute, like it's like,
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.840]   hey, we may be close and in relationship
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.520]   and it may go really well or it may be over.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.640]   Or it's like, hey, can we just be friends?
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.400]   Just wanna be friends.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:52.480]   I had a DTR once with a woman who I love very, very much.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.360]   Was down on one knee.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   Will you spend the rest of your life with me?
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.400]   Remember I asked her.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.760]   She said yes, I remember I was so happy.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.280]   And it honestly, it got closer.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.720]   I thought about this passage because I wrote her a song
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.240]   and I'm gonna sing it now.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.320]   No, I'm not gonna sing it.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.440]   I'm just kidding, I'm not.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.400]   Felt heavy, Andy's playing in the back.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.240]   Anyway.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.000]   I wrote her a song and in the song,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.160]   I listened to it today.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.200]   In the song, it just said all these crazy things.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.480]   Like, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.080]   I wanna make you happy.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.400]   I thank Jesus for you.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.240]   You're a gift from God into my life.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.440]   I'm so thrilled that all that's gonna happen on this day
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.960]   and we danced to it at our wedding, that song.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.400]   A friend, we went to a recording studio and re-recorded it
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.040]   and that song in and of itself was a DTR.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.840]   And I remember the joy that I had in writing that song
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.400]   and all the meaning that it had.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.760]   You know, this week, I mean, we've been married
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   over 10 years and we've got three kids and life happens.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.960]   And it was a hard week.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.880]   My little girl Finley, she's got strep throat.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.680]   And so we went basically two nights without sleep.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.560]   And that really big idea
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.120]   that I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.640]   It became very practical.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.000]   Like survival mode, like, yeah, of course,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.600]   I'm gonna get home and you're gonna be there
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   'cause you're always there.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.800]   And of course, like, you know, we just agree.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.520]   And you know what, yesterday I was just an idiot.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.160]   I was just an idiot to her.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.280]   I was mean, I was rude.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.640]   I totally took her for granted and took advantage of her
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.000]   because I know she'll always be there.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   She promised me she would.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.960]   She defined the relationship that she would always be there.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.400]   And so I no longer poured into it.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   I no longer cherished her.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.000]   I no longer invested in her.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.200]   And it's interesting because when I do those things,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.520]   when I invest in her and I pour into her and I cherish her,
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   man, it is a ton of fun.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   And we love each other and we laugh.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.000]   We laugh until we cry and talk for a long time.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.080]   But when I take her for granted,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.480]   there's this sense that, you know, that she's not my wife,
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.520]   that she's just kind of a housekeeper
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.080]   or childcare for our children or a prostitute
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.000]   that I would take from her pleasure.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.120]   But she's none of those things.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.040]   She's my wife.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.840]   She's my wife.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.120]   And I'm telling you, Jesus doesn't wanna be anything to you
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   other than God, Savior, and Lord, master of your life.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.200]   And you won't experience life
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.600]   as it was meant to be experienced
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.160]   until he's master of your life.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.000]   Until you're not going anywhere, he's not sending you.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.360]   Until you're not pursuing and investing in that relationship
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.040]   and pouring into him and enjoying him,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.440]   not out of obligation, not like,
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.220]   oh, I gotta read this book that doesn't make sense.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.840]   But no, I wanna know you, God.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.440]   Jesus, I want you to be king.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.720]   I've had this amazing front row seat
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.120]   of watching God change lives
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.820]   as people have made that decision.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.620]   And tonight is time for you to define the relationship.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.160]   This is what Jesus is asking you to do.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.800]   Through this text, the apostle Paul is saying,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.520]   hey, I want you to define the relationship.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.240]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.480]   Is he God and Savior, but not Lord?
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.400]   Is he God, but not Savior?
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.600]   He said, hey, bro.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.360]   Hey, friend, hey, daughter of mine.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.200]   I want to be to you God, Savior, and Lord.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.900]   All right, let me pray and we'll move to worship.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:39:05.240]   Jesus, you have supremacy.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   You have authority over your people.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.240]   You have authority over your nation.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   Jesus, take supremacy in our lives.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.560]   Remove the idols that we've brought before you,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.280]   the things that we've pursued supremacy for,
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   and let us be worthy of your love.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   Jesus, you are worthy of our affection.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.120]   You are worthy of anything that we could give you.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   You are God and we are not.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   We worship you now.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.520]   This past weekend, Monica and I got away with some friends
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   and he is a dear friend of mine, honestly,
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.840]   and I weigh these words carefully.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.520]   He's the most gifted pastor I know,
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.680]   and by pastor, I mean lover of people.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.120]   He cares for people.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.080]   He always is interruptible.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.040]   He stops and he'll go and visit folks in the hospital,
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.560]   and he's just really one of the kindest people I know,
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.080]   so much so, and I really know him.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.000]   That's not just like something I read in a magazine.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.320]   I mean, if Monica and I die,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.780]   this guy and his wife actually get our children.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.920]   He's in our will.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   And he was sharing his story, and it's a crazy story.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.440]   I mean, and the story is a failed marriage, adultery affair,
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.080]   alcoholism, cocaine use.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.120]   Literally, he paid homeless people
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.240]   to sit and drink with him.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.520]   There's a suicide attempt in there.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.640]   There was one day where he just went in his house
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.720]   and just tore everything up and threw paint on it
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.520]   and took a knife and ripped the cushions,
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.600]   and just like, it talks about rage
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.680]   and all of this crazy stuff,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.520]   and the contrast couldn't be any bigger.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.760]   For anyone who knows him, it's like,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.920]   man, you are the kindest person I've ever met
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.240]   in my entire life, and I know you,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.160]   and you sound like one of the most wicked, evil people
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.240]   I've ever even heard of, you know?
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.760]   And I'm just like, what changed?
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.120]   And he said this, and I wrote it down
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.160]   so I could share it with you.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.560]   He said, "I came to a place where I realized
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.960]   "I don't have to be in charge.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.060]   "Jesus is in charge.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.620]   "He has a plan for my life, and it's a good plan."
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.100]   And within six months of saying that,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.460]   he was in vocational ministry.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.060]   Six months after, six months earlier
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   from being in vocational ministry,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.620]   he literally was on Sixth Street
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.060]   paying homeless people to drink with him
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.780]   with $600 bar tabs, completely given to alcohol and drugs.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.380]   And now he's been a minister of the gospel
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.180]   for so many years, and I just,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.700]   he came to the realization that I don't have to be in charge.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.540]   Jesus is in charge.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.820]   He has a plan for my life, and it is a good plan.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:56.660]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.260]   When I talk about Jesus being Lord of your life,
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.940]   I'm not talking about you getting to heaven.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.540]   I'm talking about you experiencing life on this earth
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.720]   as it was intended to experience,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.460]   because when you start saying, hey, I'll follow Jesus,
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.720]   but I just, right now, I just love sex too much,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.580]   or right now, I like to spend my money in these ways,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.860]   or right now, I just love to listen to this music,
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.560]   or whatever that is for you, like silly things, right?
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.060]   Those are, that's supremacy talk.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.300]   Like, hey, I'll follow Jesus one day.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.340]   I just want this to happen first.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.020]   After I get married, you know, then I'll follow Christ.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.100]   That's supremacy talk.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.180]   All that means is you're not gonna experience life
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.420]   until then, as it was intended to experience.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.380]   That's it.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.380]   Here's the reality.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.700]   As much as I hate to admit it,
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.240]   the people who made that dress have come back
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.520]   and said it is blue and black indeed, right?
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.300]   [congregation applauding]
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.160]   There's an absolute truth behind that opinion.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.600]   I mean, there's a reality, there's a hard,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.180]   Jesus can be whoever you invent him to be.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.140]   You can say he's a good prophet, or a good teacher,
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.420]   or an idea, or your friend, or someone that you're gonna call
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.220]   if you ever need, you're gonna shoot up a flare,
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.000]   and hopefully, Jesus will come to your rescue,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.940]   but Jesus is Lord, and one day,
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.580]   every single person who has ever lived
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.900]   will know that Jesus is Lord.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.280]   either in submission or by force.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.980]   We'll all know one day.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.340]   That's why I say that with the assurance, the authority,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.900]   that everyone here will know one day Jesus is Lord.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.380]   He wants you to define the relationship tonight.
