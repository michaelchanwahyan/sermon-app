1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,580
 How we doing?

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,400
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,440
 Come on, come on.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,920
 Hey, we gotta settle this right up top, okay?

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
 Gotta get this out of the way, man.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,500
 All right?

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,160
 Just straight up, not playing games.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,680
 Just before we dive into the message,

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,560
 before we get to the truth,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,600
 I wanna know what you hear.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,080
 Laurel.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,600
 Laurel.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,080
 Laurel.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,600
 Laurel.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,440
 Laurel.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,000
 All right, how many hear Laurel?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,360
 All right, all right, all right, good representation.

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
 Okay, how many are wrong?

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,360
 (audience laughing)

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,540
 How many hear Yanny?

22
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,780
 How many, oh, you're timid, you're timid.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,840
 Some of you, oh, some of you are like,

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,200
 I heard Laurel that time.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,560
 That's because there's people around

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,680
 and you're sane, okay?

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,720
 I know what's going on.

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,560
 You're like, yeah.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,040
 Man, what kind of witchcraft is that?

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,440
 Some sort of crazy spiritual warfare.

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,320
 Enemies working in madness.

32
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,760
 It reminds, you know it reminds everybody,

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,640
 it's been said over and over, the dress.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,440
 You guys remember the dress, right?

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,240
 What do you see?

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
 What do you see?

37
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,420
 Whose team, whose team white and gold?

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,080
 Whose team white and gold?

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,240
 All right, whose team wrong?

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,720
 Blue and black.

41
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,920
 That's crazy talk.

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
 I don't even see anything that can remotely

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,220
 look like blue and black up there.

44
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,780
 White sleeves, pretty gold lace.

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,480
 But it's crazy, but okay, come with me, come with me.

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
 Hey, check this out.

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 And so you see something, you hear something,

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,040
 you feel something, and then there's a reality, right?

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,400
 Like no matter what we think we heard,

50
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 it's the guy who recorded it on vocabulary.com said Laurel.

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,020
 You might hear Yanny, but what he said was Laurel,

52
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,940
 and we know that because we can go to the source.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,240
 There's a truth, there's a reality,

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
 there's something that's fixed.

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,560
 No matter what you hear, no matter what you see,

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,680
 no matter how deeply you feel.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,900
 I look at that dress, no matter what you say,

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,520
 I see white and gold.

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,720
 I can know, I know, sister, I feel you.

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,800
 And I can't, there's nothing, I just don't get it.

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,260
 You're like, no, it's blue and black.

62
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,540
 I'm like, no, you're so wrong.

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,780
 But you know what?

64
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,840
 We can go to the source, the one who made the dress,

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
 and we see that.

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,320
 And he clearly says, hey, it's blue,

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,440
 there I see blue and black, that's blue and black.

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
 That other one's white and gold, though.

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,480
 And so, but you know, but I'm wrong.

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,580
 No matter what I think I see, no matter what I hear,

71
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,560
 no matter what I feel, there's a truth.

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,920
 And the way that you know the truth

73
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,880
 is that you go to the originator, the creator,

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,920
 the one who made the dress, the one who spoke the word,

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,480
 and they get to determine.

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,240
 And the same is true in our world,

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,440
 where in this series, The Remnant,

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,120
 David talked about last week how God preserves the people

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,840
 to preserve the world.

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,960
 Here's the reality, God has always had his people.

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,680
 There are, at any time in history since creation,

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
 there have been God followers.

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,760
 Sometimes many, sometimes few, once only two.

84
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,800
 But God has always had a people that he's preserved,

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
 that he's called to himself.

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,160
 My prayer is that now, or at least by the end

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,120
 of this message, that you would be one of them,

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,720
 that we would get to spend forever in eternity together,

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,180
 and you would leave here with the certainty

90
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,640
 that you're going to be there.

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,600
 And so tonight, I wanna talk about

92
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,480
 how The Remnant knows the truth,

93
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,960
 how the ones that God has preserved and chosen for himself

94
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,000
 and called to know him, they have a reality.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,900
 They understand the purpose for which they live.

96
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,640
 They know why the world was created,

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,640
 and why God created you, and the plans that he has for you,

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,460
 these incredible plans that the creator has for you.

99
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,280
 You can navigate this world

100
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
 like your atheist friend can't.

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,680
 You can navigate this world

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
 like your unbelieving friend can't,

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,440
 or like your friend who's pursuing a false god can't,

104
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,840
 because if there's a true God, then there's a false God,

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,800
 or lots of false gods.

106
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,160
 And I need you to know something.

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,160
 It's okay to know that, to say that,

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,320
 to believe that, regardless of the ridicule you face,

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,440
 the accusations that come against you.

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,120
 It's not a popular idea in our day

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,440
 to say that there's absolute truth.

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,320
 People believe that it's arrogant,

113
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,840
 that you would say, hey, I know what's right,

114
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
 and if I know what's right,

115
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,240
 that means that something is wrong.

116
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,000
 And so this is crazy, though.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,040
 Like, if you see a loved one,

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,240
 someone you care about deeply,

119
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,760
 and they're walking along a ledge,

120
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,600
 and they're about to fall off,

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,240
 and you run to go and catch them,

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,840
 and they say, no, no, it's okay, I think I'm a bird.

123
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,320
 You're gonna say, no, bird, you're about to feel gravity.

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,080
 The reality of gravity, you wouldn't say,

125
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,320
 oh, you think you're a bird, well, then you must be.

126
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
 You wouldn't do that.

127
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,920
 Why wouldn't you do that?

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,520
 'Cause you're not crazy, and because you love them.

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,720
 You're gonna grab them, and you're gonna pull them back.

130
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,780
 You can say, no, I don't want you to die.

131
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,680
 I don't want you, you're not a bird.

132
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,880
 You're on LSD or something.

133
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,840
 No, you can't do that, you won't fly.

134
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,760
 That's not going to go well for you.

135
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,880
 And I believe this is the most dangerous problem

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,800
 in our generation.

137
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,820
 I believe that we are being brainwashed,

138
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,840
 and it's the watering down of truth,

139
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,560
 and calling it loving.

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,540
 And if what you're saying is not true,

141
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,760
 then it's not loving.

142
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,700
 And if what you're believing is not true,

143
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,140
 then it's disastrous.

144
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,540
 It's destructive.

145
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,500
 It is going to be detrimental, not only to your health,

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,380
 but to your life.

147
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,760
 It's disastrous, it's dangerous.

148
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,020
 So how do we know what that sound is?

149
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,340
 How do we know what color the dress is?

150
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,420
 We go to the source, and the source is able to tell us,

151
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,940
 regardless of how we feel.

152
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,260
 This is what I want to return to

153
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,580
 over and over again tonight,

154
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,900
 that it's not your feelings that determine truth.

155
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,700
 If you can believe that, friends,

156
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,020
 then you're going to leave here,

157
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,820
 and I, the Holy Spirit, through the word,

158
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,240
 is going to spare you a lot of heartache,

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,780
 that your feelings don't determine reality.

160
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,500
 The way I feel does not determine what is real.

161
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,940
 The way I feel does not determine what is real.

162
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,380
 Can you guys say that with me?

163
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,100
 I'm gonna say it, and I'd love for you to repeat that,

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,620
 just so you can just kind of sense what it feels like

165
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,060
 for those words to come out of your mouth.

166
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,460
 The way I feel does not determine what is real.

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,340
 I want you to hold onto that

168
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,820
 as we dive into the Scriptures.

169
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,500
 We're gonna be in John chapter eight,

170
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,040
 and we're gonna look at how the truth will set you free,

171
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,420
 how Satan deceives to make you a slave,

172
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,940
 and how the remnant are God's relatives.

173
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,220
 Before you leave here tonight,

174
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,720
 how we're gonna look at the reality

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,980
 that we can be children of God.

176
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,100
 It's John chapter eight, verse 31.

177
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,580
 Jesus is talking to the Jews.

178
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,900
 The Pharisees are there.

179
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,820
 Jesus is saying, hey, I'm the son of God.

180
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,660
 I know God.

181
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,620
 I've been with God in eternity past.

182
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,260
 I know how to get to God.

183
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,420
 I am the truth.

184
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,220
 They're saying, no, you're a liar.

185
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,540
 Jesus is saying, no, you believed a liar.

186
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,300
 There were some people there who started to believe him.

187
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,820
 As Jesus is preaching, they begin to convert.

188
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,700
 The Holy Spirit comes into their life.

189
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,100
 They begin to understand who he is.

190
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,700
 He says this, "To the Jews who had believed him,

191
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,860
 "Jesus said, if you hold to my teaching,

192
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
 "you are really my disciples.

193
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,020
 "Then you will know the truth

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,940
 "and the truth will set you free."

195
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,060
 He says, hey, if you hold to my teachings,

196
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,140
 you're my followers, you're my disciples.

197
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,620
 You will know the truth and then you will be free.

198
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,940
 My followers, they follow me.

199
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,220
 And as you test my teaching, he's saying this,

200
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,600
 hey, test it.

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,340
 Like take the things that I've said

202
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,060
 that this is how you find life.

203
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,860
 Follow it and see if you find life there.

204
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,660
 See if you find freedom there.

205
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,980
 And as you continue to find freedom there,

206
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,460
 you're gonna know the truth.

207
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,380
 It's gonna be affirmed in you.

208
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,820
 And I've experienced this, both in my own life,

209
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,520
 but moreover in the lives of hundreds of you guys.

210
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,340
 Over the past 10 years, I've met with hundreds

211
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,620
 and hundreds of you and can I just tell you

212
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,500
 the conversation I've never had.

213
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,100
 I've never talked with the one who's faithfully,

214
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,140
 radically followed Jesus through college

215
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,160
 and they come and they say, you know what, man?

216
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,840
 I just, I just wish I would've drank more, man.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,120
 Like heroin kind of sounds awesome and I just,

218
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,360
 I'm bummed I missed out on that and you know,

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,500
 and I wish I had more sexual partners.

220
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,320
 That's really what I wish, I've never heard that.

221
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,200
 I've never heard, you know, I've always wondered

222
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
 what it's like to hug a toilet in a strip club and vomit.

223
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,860
 I just, I've always kind of, I always kind of feel

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,320
 like I missed out on that experience.

225
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,700
 No one's ever said that.

226
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,840
 But friends, can I tell you what I've heard

227
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
 over and over and over?

228
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,100
 JP, man, bro, I gotta tell my fiancee

229
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,780
 I've got, had 16 sexual partners.

230
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,740
 How do I do that?

231
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,540
 How do I tell her I've been with 16 people?

232
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,080
 How do I tell her this is my past?

233
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,640
 JP, man, I had an abortion, I had two, I had four.

234
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,620
 JP, I funded an abortion, man, I regret that.

235
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,980
 I wish that wasn't a part of my story.

236
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,660
 JP, I drank so much, I don't even remember what happened.

237
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,220
 JP, what if, what if, I mean, I think we had sex,

238
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
 I don't know, what if, what if she comes back

239
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,340
 15 years from now and says I raped her?

240
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,460
 I gotta live with that, bro, I'm scared.

241
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,900
 That ain't freedom, man.

242
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,420
 There's no freedom in that.

243
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,860
 Does that sound like freedom?

244
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,220
 Jesus is saying, hey, test me, man.

245
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,800
 You've tried it your way, would you try it my way?

246
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,940
 You're gonna experience freedom

247
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,460
 and you're gonna know the truth

248
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,420
 and that truth is gonna lead to freedom.

249
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,700
 See, this truth, and it operates like a key,

250
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,560
 it lets you out of the cage of sin.

251
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,420
 That's my first point, the truth will set you free.

252
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,260
 Knowing truth is knowing freedom.

253
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,660
 What does it mean that the truth is going to set you free?

254
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,500
 That you are captive to the truth you believe.

255
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,220
 Here's what it means.

256
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,460
 Your belief is always going to determine your behavior.

257
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,460
 What you believe is always going to determine what you do.

258
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,420
 Whom you trust in is going to determine who you follow.

259
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,100
 Your belief is always going to determine how you behave.

260
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,580
 If I wanna know what you believe,

261
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,220
 I can look at your behavior and I can say,

262
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
 well, that's what you believe.

263
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,700
 You believe there's life there.

264
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,140
 You believe there's life in the party.

265
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,340
 You believe there's life in drinking.

266
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,620
 You believe there's life in finding identity

267
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,860
 in relationships because that's what you do.

268
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,140
 And you're like, no, I don't believe that,

269
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,180
 I just slipped up.

270
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,740
 No, you believe the lie.

271
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,420
 You believe the lie.

272
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,420
 You believe the lie.

273
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,340
 If you hold to my teaching, his teaching's in the Bible,

274
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,060
 we're gonna spend a whole week on the Bible.

275
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,900
 So if you're wondering,

276
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,100
 why doesn't he go more into the Bible tonight?

277
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,540
 We're gonna spend a week there.

278
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciple.

279
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,580
 Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.

280
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,740
 Freedom comes from knowing and knowing leads to following.

281
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,020
 Does what we believe determine our behavior?

282
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,580
 My daughter came home from school the other day

283
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,860
 and she said, Daddy, we talked about heaven.

284
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,140
 Dad said, oh yeah, what did that look like?

285
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,060
 She said, well, one of my friends believes

286
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,380
 that whenever you die,

287
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,500
 that everyone who dies becomes a squirrel.

288
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,580
 Silly, isn't it?

289
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,500
 And you just think about that.

290
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,780
 And I said, well, where does that come from?

291
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,100
 Like, that's a cool belief, like neat, okay,

292
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,460
 everybody becomes a squirrel, there's lots of them around.

293
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,500
 But that's really gonna impact how you treat squirrels.

294
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,060
 Like, if it could be great-great-grandmother

295
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,740
 or great-great-grandfather, right, you're swerving

296
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,100
 to miss 'em and you're feeding 'em out back

297
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,780
 'cause they may be a relative, you know?

298
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,660
 And as you laugh, you gotta keep in mind,

299
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,820
 there's an entire world religion

300
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,060
 that embraces this idea of reincarnation.

301
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,300
 And it's why they don't kill rats,

302
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,180
 but treat them with respect because they may be relatives.

303
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
 That's the truth.

304
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,220
 Then you say, well, that's funny.

305
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,620
 You're giggling, you're laughing.

306
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,780
 It's not any more funny than saying,

307
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,480
 I believe everyone goes to heaven.

308
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,060
 Cool, you believe, I wanna believe that.

309
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,100
 Where does it come from?

310
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,020
 Oh, wait, wait, hold on.

311
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,120
 Do you believe that because it feels good?

312
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,300
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, your feelings

313
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,360
 get to determine what is reality.

314
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,880
 I don't believe there's a hell.

315
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,600
 Cool!

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,700
 Where did that come from?

317
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,260
 What divine revelation did you have

318
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,460
 that showed you, what book did you read?

319
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,180
 Like, where did you go to school

320
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,860
 where the professor said, hey, sit down

321
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,100
 because I got something I wanna break off for you?

322
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,660
 There's no such thing as hell.

323
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,740
 I can prove it.

324
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,300
 Where did that belief come from?

325
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,820
 And if you were honest, you were like,

326
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,860
 well, I just, you know, I was kinda thinking about it

327
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,580
 and I just kinda feel like, would God really send?

328
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,600
 I don't know, did he say he would?

329
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,500
 What's your source of truth?

330
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,420
 You have to know what you believe

331
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,940
 and you have to know why you believe it.

332
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,920
 What do you believe?

333
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,380
 And why do you believe it?

334
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,420
 And as you believe that, that's going to have

335
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,540
 tremendous impact on how you act.

336
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,820
 Is that true, right?

337
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,860
 Is that true?

338
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,340
 The reason that you look at porn,

339
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,180
 the reason you buy things you can't afford,

340
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,260
 the reason you have sex outside of marriage,

341
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,740
 the reason you get drunk is because you think

342
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,140
 it will bring life and you trust your feelings

343
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,180
 over God's instruction.

344
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,300
 And so let's test it.

345
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,760
 Does your belief determine your behavior?

346
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,000
 Let me just ask you a few questions.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
 We'll do a little quiz here.

348
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,060
 Did anyone ever wait 30 minutes to swim after you ate?

349
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,000
 Anybody ever do that?

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,960
 I did, like just hoot or raise your hand or something.

351
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,800
 Yeah, so did anyone ever avoid Coke or chocolate

352
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,420
 because it causes acne?

353
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,640
 So like prom, hey, don't wanna eat chocolate,

354
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,720
 don't wanna break out.

355
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,360
 Did anyone ever, you know, you don't wanna,

356
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
 you wanna get dressed before you go outside

357
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,920
 when it's really cold because you don't wanna catch a cold

358
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,560
 so you put on a beanie or a hat.

359
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,700
 Your mom's like, hey, put on your shoes,

360
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,540
 you don't wanna catch a cold.

361
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,720
 So you go put on your shoes because it's cold outside.

362
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
 Anybody ever do that?

363
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
 Dress warm?

364
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,280
 Has anyone ever backed up from the TV

365
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,780
 so it wouldn't hurt your eyes?

366
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,280
 Your parents walk in, hey, scoot back,

367
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,240
 you don't wanna go blind.

368
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,160
 Did anyone ever not swallow gum because you didn't want it

369
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,960
 to stay in your stomach for seven years?

370
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,600
 (congregation laughing)

371
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,540
 You're like, dude, I don't want a big old gumball in there,

372
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,560
 not gonna do it, not happening.

373
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,840
 Did anyone ever avoid shaving something

374
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,160
 because it would come back darker and thicker,

375
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,800
 like your eyebrows right here?

376
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,120
 You're like, I don't want a unibrow

377
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,960
 for the rest of my life.

378
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
 I love your boldness to raise your hand.

379
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
 (congregation laughing)

380
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,240
 Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

381
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,060
 And so here's the deal, all of those are myths.

382
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,540
 Oh, no, all that time wasted that you could've been swimming

383
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,400
 right after you ate, you wouldn't get a cramp.

384
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,160
 You don't catch a cold from being cold.

385
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,540
 Catch a cold from the bug, you know,

386
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,340
 it transfers from one person to another, it's contagious.

387
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,240
 TV won't hurt your eyes.

388
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,580
 Except that shaving thing, that's true,

389
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,460
 so I'm sorry for that.

390
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,540
 No, I'm kidding, it's not true.

391
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,220
 No, that's not true either, right?

392
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,040
 But all of that, that belief impacted the way we behave.

393
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,240
 That's why those myths have came into reality,

394
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,260
 that someone would try to impact what you would do

395
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,620
 and so they would breathe into, hey,

396
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,860
 I don't want you to swim right after you eat.

397
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,760
 So you need to sit out for 30 minutes.

398
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,780
 And so you sat there sitting out for 30 minutes

399
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,380
 based on a belief, but it wasn't grounded in truth.

400
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,500
 And those are pretty innocent.

401
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,520
 But this is where I think the church has missed

402
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,580
 in a really bad way.

403
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,800
 Because when someone's being bad, we sit them down

404
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
 and we talk to them about how they're behaving.

405
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,280
 You know, why are you looking at pornography?

406
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,440
 Why are you living with him?

407
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,300
 Why are you getting drunk?

408
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,160
 You need to stop doing that, stop being bad.

409
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
 No, no, no, no, no, you're believing a lie

410
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,780
 that's harmful to you, that God, the creator

411
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,480
 of the heavens and the earth has given you instruction

412
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,600
 not to rip you off, to set you free,

413
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,160
 and what you're doing is actually going to hurt you

414
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,760
 and you're believing that life is there

415
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,600
 but life is not found there.

416
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,660
 You're believing a lie.

417
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,420
 Let's strip it back and understand

418
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,380
 what lie you're believing.

419
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,560
 First John 1:16 says, "If we claim to have fellowship

420
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,520
 "with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie

421
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,760
 "and do not live out the truth."

422
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,640
 It's a really simple verse.

423
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,040
 If you claim to be a Christ follower

424
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,000
 but you're not following Jesus, you should ask,

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,140
 am I really a Christ follower?

426
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,840
 Like if I say, hey, I follow Jesus,

427
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,680
 but I don't follow Jesus, I should ask,

428
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,480
 do I really follow Jesus?

429
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,680
 It's just kind of common sense.

430
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
 Where are you at?

431
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,240
 Are you a Christ follower?

432
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,120
 And so just imagine now before we move on in the text,

433
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,120
 imagine if we actually lived what we said we believed.

434
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,680
 Like imagine if we read this book

435
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
 and we just said, okay, this is true.

436
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,720
 So one, I believe that this is God's word

437
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,120
 and instruction for living life,

438
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
 suitable for correcting, rebuking,

439
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,560
 and training in righteousness.

440
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,400
 And you know what?

441
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,960
 I believe that I can talk to the creator

442
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,120
 of the heavens and the earth and he listens to me.

443
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,080
 And so, right, I can pray.

444
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
 Wouldn't you pray all the time if you believed

445
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
 that you could talk to the creator?

446
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,960
 Like wouldn't you spend so much time praying?

447
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,920
 And if you believe that sex outside of marriage

448
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,240
 wasn't just a bad idea,

449
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,520
 but it's literally killing your marriage

450
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,320
 long before you even have a prospect,

451
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 wouldn't you say, okay, I don't wanna do that?

452
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,440
 And if you believe that getting drunk

453
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
 wasn't just like God was trying to keep you from it,

454
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
 but he's trying to save you from addiction

455
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,960
 and poverty and hurt and being an alcoholic later

456
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,660
 and having your children hate you.

457
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,580
 Imagine if we believe that people

458
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,900
 were actually going to hell

459
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,500
 and that the way they didn't go to hell

460
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,420
 is by us sharing Jesus with them.

461
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,500
 How many people would we share Christ with

462
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,220
 if we really believed that truth?

463
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,380
 Like what if we just believed this was true?

464
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,060
 How would that impact your life?

465
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,540
 The remnant knows the truth.

466
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,060
 And the truth is a person.

467
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,620
 The remnant knows the truth

468
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,340
 and the truth is a person.

469
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,220
 They answered Jesus.

470
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,660
 We are Abraham's descendants

471
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,420
 and we have never been slaves of anyone.

472
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,700
 How can you say that we shall be set free?

473
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,140
 Jesus says, then you will know the truth,

474
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,980
 you shall be free.

475
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,100
 They say free, free from what?

476
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,440
 We're free.

477
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,420
 That's the hardest person to share the gospel with

478
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,300
 is the person that says, hey, I don't need Jesus.

479
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,980
 You're telling me Jesus is gonna make my life better.

480
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,380
 My life is fine, no thanks.

481
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
 You're like, hey, eternal life.

482
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,940
 I don't need eternal life, I need tomorrow.

483
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,860
 I need the party this weekend, no thanks.

484
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,540
 Jesus replied, very truly, I tell you,

485
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,820
 everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

486
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,640
 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family,

487
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,980
 but a son belongs to it forever.

488
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,420
 So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

489
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,300
 I know that you are Abraham's descendants,

490
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,500
 yet you are looking for a way to kill me.

491
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,660
 Because you have no room for my word,

492
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,180
 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence

493
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,300
 and you are doing what you have heard from your father.

494
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,200
 When he says your father, he's talking about Satan.

495
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,460
 They say, no, Abraham is our father.

496
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
 He says, no, if Abraham was your father,

497
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,740
 you'd do what Abraham did, but no, you're trying to kill me.

498
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,460
 You're not like Abraham.

499
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,660
 You're doing the works of your own father, the devil.

500
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,500
 And he says, we're not a legitimate trinity.

501
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,660
 He says, they say the only father we have is God himself.

502
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,060
 Jesus said to them, if God were your father,

503
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,820
 you would love me, for I have come here from God.

504
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,180
 I have not come on my own, God sent me.

505
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,500
 Why is my language not clear to you?

506
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,780
 Because you are unable to hear what I say.

507
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,380
 You belong to your father, the devil.

508
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,900
 He's not pulling any punches now.

509
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,740
 You belong to your father, the devil,

510
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,180
 and you wanna carry out your father's desires.

511
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,320
 He was a murderer from the beginning,

512
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,020
 not holding to the truth, but there is no truth in him.

513
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,260
 When he lies, he speaks his native language,

514
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,680
 for he is a liar and the father of lies.

515
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,300
 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.

516
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,060
 Sin is simply believing a lie.

517
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,300
 And we see the clear, the enemy's clear strategy to get you.

518
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,400
 There's an enemy, there's Satan, he hates you.

519
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,460
 All of the dreams that God has for you,

520
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,860
 he desires to destroy.

521
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,340
 He wants you stuck in sin, slave to sin,

522
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,500
 amounting to nothing, wasting your life,

523
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,560
 living maybe the little American dream and dying,

524
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,020
 a meaningless, purposeless life.

525
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,260
 My second point, Satan desires to make you a slave.

526
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,660
 Every one of us is most likely being deceived

527
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,020
 by Satan right now in some way that's really unsettling.

528
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,420
 And so I've always wondered how Satan works,

529
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,260
 like what can he do?

530
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,060
 Like for example, like spiritual warfare.

531
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,140
 Like if I'm gonna go share the gospel with a guy

532
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,660
 and I turn the key to my truck and it doesn't start,

533
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,960
 the battery's dead, and I'm like, oh, spiritual warfare.

534
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,540
 Did Satan like drain my battery?

535
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,420
 Like what did he do, what are his capabilities?

536
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
 Did he get in there and mess with my alternator?

537
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,740
 What can he do, right?

538
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,680
 Fair question.

539
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,460
 Here's what he can do.

540
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,720
 He's got a strategy, it's a really simple one.

541
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,940
 He can try to get you to believe his lies.

542
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,020
 And it's really hard because when you're believing his lies,

543
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,840
 you can't see it.

544
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,020
 And people who love you can come around you and say,

545
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,940
 hey, he's not any good for you, but you're like,

546
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,060
 but I love him.

547
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,260
 And they can say, hey, you shouldn't do that.

548
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,940
 And you're like, but it's fun.

549
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,760
 And I think God would want me to have fun.

550
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,160
 And you begin to justify your sin.

551
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,680
 Jesus replied, very truly, I tell you,

552
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
 everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

553
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,920
 In verse 44, the devil was a murderer from the beginning,

554
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
 not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.

555
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,100
 When he lies, he speaks his native language,

556
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,560
 for he is a liar and the father of lies.

557
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,920
 Migue, I liken it to like when the Nazis were trying

558
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,040
 to get the Jews into a concentration camp,

559
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,120
 they didn't say, hey, jump on the train

560
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,900
 'cause we're gonna take you to a concentration camp

561
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,200
 and kill you, right?

562
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
 They would have risked their lives

563
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,120
 to not get on that train.

564
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,880
 What they said is, hey, we're going to labor camps.

565
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 You can come here, it may not be pleasant,

566
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,160
 but at least you'll have a job.

567
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,880
 Get on the train, get on the train.

568
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
 They take him to the train, they get off the train,

569
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,800
 say, hey, go in there and take a shower.

570
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,040
 We want you to get clean.

571
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,740
 It's a gas chamber, and they gas them and they kill them.

572
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,480
 How did they get them in the gas chamber?

573
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
 They lied.

574
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,140
 That's what Satan's doing to you, he's lying.

575
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,160
 But it's different from that illustration

576
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,440
 because he'll actually get us to defend our lie,

577
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,500
 to love our lie so much that we begin to defend it.

578
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,660
 No, but I want to, but no, no, no, you don't understand.

579
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,440
 It's like art, it's a beautiful creature,

580
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,360
 and I don't know, is masturbation really a sin?

581
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,700
 And if God didn't want me to do this,

582
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,440
 why would he give me these desires?

583
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,720
 And that's called justification.

584
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,920
 But we're married in God's eyes.

585
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,820
 What is marriage anyways, really?

586
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,080
 And you will defend your sin,

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,520
 cohabitate with the enemy,

588
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,720
 as they keep lying to me,

589
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,660
 'cause I enjoy your lies more than the truth.

590
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,060
 In this world, you're the prince of this world, Satan,

591
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:38,160
 and it's easier to live this world under the guise of lies

592
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,320
 than to be one of the narrow ones who follow the truth

593
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,440
 on the narrow path.

594
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,760
 It's so much easier to believe the lies.

595
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,720
 I don't want to be weird, I don't want to be a Jesus freak,

596
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,200
 I don't want to be radical for my faith.

597
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 In 1973, there was a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden,

598
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,840
 and they took four hostages captive.

599
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,560
 And they beat them and abused them,

600
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,840
 and they were ultimately rescued,

601
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,880
 but something really interesting happened.

602
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,640
 The hostages wouldn't testify against

603
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,040
 those who held them captive.

604
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,920
 There was some weird bond that was created between them,

605
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
 and they defended them.

606
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,140
 And that was birthed a phrase called Stockholm syndrome.

607
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,440
 Stockholm syndrome, I'll read you the definition.

608
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:38,360
 Defined as strong emotional ties

609
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 that develop between two persons

610
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
 when one person intimately harasses, beats,

611
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,000
 threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other.

612
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,280
 I'll give you another modern example of Stockholm syndrome.

613
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,120
 Often when girls are trafficked into the sex trade

614
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,760
 and made sex slaves, they're beaten, abused,

615
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,840
 they're fed drugs, they're raped for profit on the daily,

616
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,440
 sometimes urinated on, and just terrible things,

617
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,040
 unspeakable things, and when they go to be rescued,

618
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,240
 a lot of times they will reject the rescuer

619
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,960
 and say, hey, I want to stay with my pimp.

620
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
 It's called Stockholm syndrome.

621
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,660
 And you say, well, that's crazy.

622
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,040
 I know what you're thinking right now.

623
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,560
 You're like, man, that's crazy, I would never do that.

624
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,860
 You do that every day.

625
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,400
 Jesus shows up and says, hey, I want to pull you

626
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,960
 out of the club, I want to pull you out of that life.

627
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,240
 I have a better life, I want to pull you

628
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,080
 out of that relationship, I want to pull you away

629
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,120
 from that website, away from that hashtag,

630
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,680
 away from that social media, away from that debt,

631
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,640
 away from that buying, away from that coping.

632
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,920
 I have something better, and you look at him

633
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,460
 and you say, Jesus, no thank you.

634
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,680
 I love my sin more than you.

635
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,700
 Jesus, I want to stay here with Jesus.

636
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,540
 Would you just leave me alone in this season?

637
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,280
 Maybe you and I will get right in another season,

638
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,480
 but right now I'd like to keep doing this.

639
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,940
 I love my sin too much.

640
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,480
 Stockholm syndrome, you're a slave.

641
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,620
 You're a slave to sin.

642
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,500
 You've been deceived by the enemy.

643
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,140
 You've believed his lies, and I'm trying

644
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,420
 to wake you up right now.

645
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,780
 We fall too deeply in love with our sin

646
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,400
 that when Jesus offers us freedom, we say no thank you.

647
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,580
 And consider your sins that we'd willingly

648
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,880
 walk into the trap of pornography or drinking.

649
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,720
 We begin to justify, well, Jesus drank,

650
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,200
 yeah, not shots of tequila.

651
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,560
 It's this weird thing that you wanted

652
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,200
 the freedom to do something that now you can't stop doing.

653
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,840
 I wanted the freedom to look at that image,

654
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,120
 but now I can't stop chasing those images.

655
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,040
 It keeps showing up every month or every week

656
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,920
 or every other month.

657
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,040
 I go back like a dog to his vomit,

658
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
 to this thing that's destroying me.

659
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,260
 What's wrong with me?

660
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,320
 Who will save me from this body of death?

661
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,680
 You can stay with me for just a moment.

662
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,500
 It's very prominent in our culture.

663
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,240
 There's this weird thing, the gender wars,

664
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,700
 that's going on on our time.

665
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,240
 If I was born a man and I feel like a woman,

666
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,520
 then my emotional intelligence determines my gender.

667
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,420
 It's no longer binary, right?

668
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,320
 Here's the problem.

669
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,360
 There's several problems with that.

670
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,020
 Let me give you a few just to think on.

671
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,040
 Okay, let's say someone was killed.

672
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,880
 We find the body and we're trying to identify the body.

673
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
 The first question we're gonna ask,

674
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,260
 well, is the body male or female?

675
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,100
 I don't know, they're dead,

676
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,600
 so I can't see their emotional intelligence.

677
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,800
 I don't know how they feel.

678
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,000
 I don't know if they felt like a man

679
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,960
 or if they felt like a woman.

680
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,780
 I don't know.

681
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,560
 In my effort to explain this to you,

682
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,960
 and this is where it gets tricky,

683
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,300
 see, some of you are turning me off right now.

684
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,820
 You're like, hey, you're marginalizing the transgender.

685
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,160
 No, I'm not, I love the transgender.

686
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,000
 What, you need a home?

687
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,880
 You got one, I'll give you one.

688
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,720
 You need some money?

689
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,540
 You can have mine.

690
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,380
 You need a meal?

691
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,160
 Sit down with my family and eat at our table.

692
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,740
 I love you.

693
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,920
 I don't hate you.

694
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,140
 Okay?

695
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,920
 We can say, hey, we can talk about same-sex attraction.

696
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,300
 Say, hey, you were born that way.

697
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,200
 I'm not here to argue that you were born that way.

698
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,440
 Do you know how I was born?

699
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,120
 Do you know how messed up and depraved that I was born?

700
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,920
 Born a polygamist,

701
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,740
 not able to be satisfied by a single woman.

702
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,360
 Oh, a heterosexual pervert.

703
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,260
 That's who's talking to you right now.

704
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,280
 Like, let me just ask you a question.

705
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
 Let me ask you a question by show of hands.

706
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,840
 How many of you would say you were a Christian in college?

707
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
 Like, if I would've met you in college,

708
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,080
 you would've said, hey, I'm a Christian.

709
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
 Just raise your hand if you were a Christian in college.

710
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,080
 Okay?

711
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,900
 A lot of you.

712
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,000
 A lot of you who would say you're a Christian in college.

713
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,800
 Okay, now, don't raise your hand on this one.

714
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,720
 I just want you to think about it.

715
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,840
 How many of you did something sexually

716
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,880
 that you knew would dishonor God in college?

717
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 You don't have to raise your hand.

718
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,680
 Just think, okay, I know I did, right?

719
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,080
 I did something that I knew dishonored God.

720
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,980
 Well, what did you do?

721
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,760
 You rejected the truth.

722
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,160
 You believed a lie,

723
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
 even though you called yourself a Christian.

724
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,920
 And the most loving thing that I could do

725
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,360
 in that circumstance is to intersect and say,

726
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,400
 hey, God loves you.

727
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,640
 This is not who you are.

728
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,580
 This is not his best for you.

729
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,200
 He has something better for you.

730
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
 And your sin is no different

731
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,440
 than any of the other sins I just said.

732
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,940
 It's also where the church has missed it,

733
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,160
 where it's gone and made some kind of sexual,

734
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,400
 or some kind of special categories for some sins.

735
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,900
 No.

736
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,180
 All of our sexual sin goes into the same bucket.

737
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,020
 We're all messed up.

738
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,040
 We all need a Savior.

739
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,060
 Praise God we have one.

740
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,360
 The remnant knows the truth.

741
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,660
 The truth is a person.

742
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,940
 His name is Jesus.

743
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,980
 His name is Jesus.

744
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,640
 This is Romans one, verse 25.

745
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,300
 It says, "They exchange the truth of God for a lie."

746
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,560
 Go and read Romans one later.

747
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,420
 There's a homework assignment for you.

748
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,980
 The truth will always sound like hate

749
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,520
 to those who hate the truth.

750
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,440
 And a lie will always sound loving to those who live a lie.

751
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,220
 But the problem with living a lie, friends,

752
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,920
 is it's not who you are.

753
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,560
 It's not who you are.

754
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
 Now listen to me.

755
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
 The third point from this text

756
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,680
 is the remnant are God's relatives.

757
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,140
 This is a beautiful truth straight from this text.

758
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,360
 The remnant are God's relatives.

759
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,200
 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family,

760
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,380
 but a son belongs to it forever.

761
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,340
 So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

762
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,960
 See, the slave, a slave is an employee.

763
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
 A slave comes and goes.

764
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,800
 A slave is at convenience.

765
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,080
 But a son, there's nothing that son can do

766
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,600
 to not be a part of the family.

767
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,680
 And who makes you a son to God most high,

768
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,280
 the creator of the heavens and the earth

769
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,320
 is his own son, Jesus Christ,

770
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,920
 adopting you into his family by his death and resurrection

771
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,560
 for the forgiveness of your sins

772
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,260
 so that you might be adopted sons and daughters.

773
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,720
 This is the beautiful truth of this verse.

774
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,920
 And so the world that you exist in, here's the truth, ready?

775
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,680
 The world that you exist in, it was created by God.

776
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,600
 He made humanity in his image.

777
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,680
 He designed them beautifully to function

778
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,800
 in a particular way.

779
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,040
 He made their parts and he made the parts

780
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,840
 to fit with the other parts the way they do.

781
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,920
 He invented sex.

782
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,680
 He made it feel the way that he does.

783
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
 It was his idea.

784
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,040
 He has a design to it.

785
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,640
 It's just, it's brilliant.

786
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,520
 It's mind-blowingly brilliant.

787
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,760
 And he created the earth.

788
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,080
 And it was lost to our sin,

789
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,720
 but he's gonna come back and repair it, make it perfect,

790
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 and create a place for you to live forever

791
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,660
 and ever and ever, that when you die,

792
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,480
 you can live with God forever.

793
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,920
 Or you can live separated from him forever.

794
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,680
 And that's the reality that you live in.

795
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
 And if you embrace that truth every day,

796
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,680
 you renew your mind around that truth,

797
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,480
 you better believe it's going to impact how you live.

798
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
 And God loves you so much,

799
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,200
 you have the freedom to do anything in this world,

800
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,200
 anything that you want, and glorify him except sin.

801
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,520
 Did you know that, that anything that you do

802
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,820
 other than sin glorifies the Father?

803
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,360
 He looks down at you, or he looks at you,

804
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,120
 and he is pleased, he finds great joy

805
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,520
 in the way that you work and in the way that you play

806
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,420
 and the things that you do except sin.

807
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,240
 Because he's truth.

808
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,720
 And no loving parent wants to watch

809
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,240
 their children believe a lie.

810
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,440
 And he designed the world, he's the source,

811
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,300
 he's the creator, the originator.

812
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,280
 And he gets to determine the way that life should be lived

813
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,860
 so that you might experience it to the fullest.

814
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,840
 And if you're here and you're the remnant,

815
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 you're the only ones who know the truth.

816
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,200
 And the truth is that Christ sets you free from sin.

817
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,240
 That immediately upon trusting in Christ,

818
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,280
 he sets you free from the penalty of sin.

819
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,860
 You don't have to go to hell,

820
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,600
 you get to be with God forever.

821
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
 And as you continue to walk in him and know the truth,

822
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,460
 he sets you free from the power of sin

823
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,160
 that one day, like a dog to his vomit,

824
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,680
 you continue to return to sin,

825
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,320
 but as you trust in Jesus, you begin to,

826
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,160
 as you trust in his spirit, be able to resist sin.

827
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,520
 And one day, friends, he's going to set you free

828
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,840
 from the presence of sin,

829
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,460
 that you will be somewhere with him in his presence

830
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,040
 where nothing remotely will remind you of sin, praise God.

831
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
 And so you follow him, even if,

832
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
 and I need you to hear this, this is really important,

833
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,360
 even if, and I'm talking to you,

834
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,800
 in fact, close your eyes for just a minute

835
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,280
 so you can hear this, like I'm talking to you,

836
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,580
 I'm talking straight to you,

837
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,940
 even if you're the only one,

838
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,940
 even if you're the only one on the planet Earth,

839
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,980
 you follow him.

840
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,980
 If the entire world says he's not the way,

841
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,780
 you say, I believe he is the way,

842
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,280
 and I'm going to follow him.

843
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,620
 It's like Noah.

844
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,540
 Noah was the only one, right?

845
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,380
 He built the ark.

846
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,220
 They said he was crazy.

847
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,040
 It hadn't even rained.

848
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,300
 He's building a boat in the middle of nowhere.

849
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,260
 You be like Noah.

850
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,980
 You say, God told me to build a boat.

851
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,080
 I'm building a boat.

852
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,740
 I'll spend decades and decades and decades of my life.

853
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,580
 You believe that a man died for your sins

854
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,560
 and rose from the dead and that you get to live forever.

855
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,280
 The remnant knows the truth and his name is Jesus.

856
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,580
 And friends, listen, something can be true.

857
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,420
 I want you to listen.

858
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,240
 You can look at me now.

859
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,240
 Something can be true, even if no one knows it.

860
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,720
 Something can be true, even if no one admits it.

861
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,260
 Something can be true, even if no one agrees what it is.

862
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,220
 Something can be true,

863
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,980
 even if no one on the earth follows it.

864
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,520
 And something can be true,

865
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,200
 even if no one but God grasps it fully.

866
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,020
 It comes from a book, "True for You, But Not for Me."

867
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,500
 And so you belong to Jesus.

868
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,460
 That's your reality.

869
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,960
 It's a beautiful reality.

870
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,300
 You get to be brothers and sisters to Christ.

871
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,380
 I think David told you last week

872
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,980
 that two weeks ago we were in London.

873
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,040
 One night, it was late, about 11 p.m. there,

874
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,460
 and we were walking back to our hotel

875
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,100
 and we passed this homeless couple

876
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,480
 and they were in bad shape.

877
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,780
 Almost looked like they were playing a homeless couple

878
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,540
 in a movie, really thin.

879
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,540
 He had red hair and she was a brunette

880
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,180
 and they were there on the side of the street

881
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,500
 and they were begging everyone that came by,

882
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
 could you have any change?

883
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,540
 In this thick English accent,

884
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,420
 do you have any change, do you have any change?

885
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,540
 I walked by and said, I don't have any change.

886
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,060
 The Holy Spirit convicted us.

887
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,220
 We said, why don't we go back?

888
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,680
 And we went back and engaged with them and said,

889
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,720
 hey, we don't have money, but can we get you a meal?

890
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,580
 Are you hungry?

891
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,620
 And they said, yeah, we're hungry.

892
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,820
 And said, what would you like?

893
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,060
 And she said, KFC.

894
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,940
 She was real specific.

895
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,860
 I said, all right, we'll find a KFC.

896
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,900
 They got those in London.

897
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,660
 And so, around the corner, there was a KFC

898
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,900
 and we went in and ordered a bucket of chicken

899
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,900
 and biscuits and mashed potatoes and green beans

900
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,340
 and two large drinks and we carried them back to them

901
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,380
 and they were so elated.

902
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,260
 They said, you came back, no one ever comes back.

903
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,100
 And I said, of course we came back.

904
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,260
 And we gave them the bucket of chicken

905
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,820
 and we sat down and what happened was gross, kind of.

906
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,820
 I mean, they just were hungry

907
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,020
 and they just grabbed and mashed potatoes

908
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,220
 and just green beans and chicken.

909
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,300
 It was all over their face

910
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,620
 and we're trying to engage them with the gospel,

911
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,220
 but they weren't even, it was just like eating,

912
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,860
 the sound of eating.

913
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,200
 (congregation laughing)

914
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,460
 Imagine for just a moment, if I would've looked closer

915
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,420
 and I would've realized, wait a minute,

916
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,900
 are you Prince Harry and Meghan?

917
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,020
 What do you, imagine.

918
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,580
 That's not what happened, but just imagine with me.

919
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,420
 Imagine, imagine, imagine if that's what,

920
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,820
 what God, wait, hold on, guys, this isn't,

921
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,740
 this isn't where you belong, you know?

922
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,580
 You belong in Kensington Palace.

923
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,740
 I mean, you don't yet 'cause you're not married,

924
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,380
 but you belong there, Kensington Palace.

925
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,940
 You're a prince, like you should go to the,

926
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,580
 hey, how dare you say where I need to be, man?

927
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,420
 If I wanna be on the street, I'm a homeless person.

928
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,660
 I'm a beggar, who are you to tell me,

929
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,780
 who are you to come at me and tell me I'm a prince?

930
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,540
 I'm not, no, no, you don't understand.

931
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,340
 I'm just trying to define reality.

932
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,700
 You're a prince, like you belong in the palace.

933
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,520
 You have a home there.

934
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,020
 You shouldn't be out here begging for scraps.

935
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,640
 You should be in your palace.

936
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,740
 You're for kingdom.

937
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,260
 You're an heir, you're royalty.

938
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,060
 You'll soon be royalty too.

939
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,860
 This isn't who you are.

940
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,060
 It's not who you are.

941
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,060
 You understand?

942
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,100
 You trusted in Jesus, what he's done for you.

943
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,300
 You become an heir to his kingdom.

944
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,140
 You are a prince and a princess.

945
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,540
 If you weren't made for strong drink and for the party,

946
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,740
 like the pagans,

947
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,380
 if you weren't made to experience

948
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,540
 and experience in different positions

949
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,740
 and different pleasures, the pagans,

950
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,060
 if you weren't made to return

951
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,160
 to those two-dimensional images of women and men

952
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,660
 who don't belong to you,

953
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,100
 created in the image of God to his sons and daughters

954
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,420
 so that you might have your way with them

955
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,660
 in the privacy of your home,

956
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,540
 sitting at your computer, on your cell phone,

957
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,520
 you weren't made for that, man.

958
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,300
 If you weren't made to return to that deadly relationship

959
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,780
 or to find identity in men

960
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,620
 or to continue to dress that way,

961
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,900
 to give away your body so that people would notice you,

962
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,860
 that you would walk out of a room and wonder,

963
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,240
 they're thinking about me.

964
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,300
 You're loved by the king, man.

965
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,140
 The king, he's crazy about you.

966
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,780
 He's like, what do you want me to do to prove it?

967
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,940
 I'll give my son for you, my only son.

968
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,700
 I'll give him to purchase you to me,

969
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,180
 to buy you from your sin, to set you free.

970
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,980
 I'll do that for you.

971
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,260
 It happened.

972
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,380
 It really, really happened.

973
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,380
 God gave his only son because he loves you.

974
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:39,860
 In summary, the truth will set you free.

975
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,980
 Satan deceives to make you a slave.

976
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,620
 And the remnant are God's relatives.

977
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:58,980
 In writing this message, I was reminded of my own story.

978
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:06,280
 A slave to relationships, a slave to pornography,

979
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,540
 a slave to sex, a slave to money, a slave to stuff.

980
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,540
 I wanted a nicer car, a swaggier place, a better suit,

981
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,860
 watches for every day of the week.

982
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,060
 A slave to what you thought of me.

983
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,340
 Are they thinking about me?

984
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,580
 Do they like me?

985
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:32,540
 This is what I was, but here's the deal.

986
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,900
 If you would have seen me, you wouldn't have seen a slave.

987
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,300
 You'd be like, man, he's got it together.

988
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,700
 Mr. Dallas right there.

989
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,420
 Like everything wrong with Dallas in one person, that was me.

990
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,460
 And I stumbled into a church.

991
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,300
 I sat in the back row.

992
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,260
 I was hung over.

993
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,140
 And this guy's telling this story about a horse,

994
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,620
 a silly horse, a story about a horse.

995
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,580
 And this horse just wanted to be free.

996
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,500
 And in his pursuit of freedom, he had to hunt for food

997
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,900
 and hunt for water and hunt for shelter.

998
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,700
 He didn't wanna be captured.

999
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900
 And one day this cowboy came up,

1000
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,100
 and as this preacher talked, he said,

1001
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,280
 he successfully captured this horse.

1002
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,580
 And he took him home.

1003
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,660
 And he loved him.

1004
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,420
 And he cared for him.

1005
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,260
 He provided for him.

1006
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,640
 He protected him from the elements.

1007
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,160
 He gave him food and water.

1008
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,620
 He learned to ride him and lead him

1009
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,980
 to the things that he needed.

1010
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,500
 And it was this line right here that got me.

1011
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,340
 You ready?

1012
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,340
 He said, and it wasn't until he was fully submissive

1013
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,740
 to his master that he truly experienced freedom.

1014
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,740
 And I just said, man, God, if you're real,

1015
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,540
 if there's a God that I wanna give my life to you,

1016
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,060
 you drive, I don't wanna drive.

1017
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,940
 You take my life.

1018
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,140
 You do with me whatever you please.

1019
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,900
 I know that I'm not doing the things that you desire for me.

1020
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,820
 And so all I really knew at that point was there was a God,

1021
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,300
 but I really didn't think he was the Christian God.

1022
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,980
 I went home, I bought a book on world religions.

1023
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,020
 I looked at the Hindu faith, the Buddhist faith,

1024
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,860
 the Jewish faith, the Islamic faith,

1025
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,220
 Mormons, Jehovah's Witness,

1026
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,420
 Church of Christian Science and Scientology.

1027
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,980
 And as I explored those world religions,

1028
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,340
 I kept tripping over the truth of Jesus.

1029
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,980
 I looked into the Bible and I was blown away

1030
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,500
 by the evidence that supported that it hadn't been changed,

1031
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,860
 that it was preserved, and that the message in it

1032
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,620
 was this truth that led to life.

1033
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:32,820
 That 2018 years ago, on Jesus's birth,

1034
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,300
 the calendar reset and every atheist you know

1035
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,220
 acknowledges him by the date they put on their checks.

1036
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,860
 I was blown away by the evidence.

1037
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:49,180
 And I said, Jesus, I believe that you lived.

1038
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,460
 I believe that you died for me.

1039
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,820
 And I believe that God raised you from the dead.

1040
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,820
 And Jesus, I'm desperate for your Holy Spirit

1041
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,780
 to come into my life, to help me,

1042
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,020
 to free me from my slavery, to pornography,

1043
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,660
 to stuff, to money, to girls, to sex, identity.

1044
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,460
 Would you give me a greater purpose

1045
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,860
 and help me to live for you?

1046
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:22,060
 And Jesus recruited me to the remnant by revealing truth.

1047
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,300
 And I can remember sitting on my friend's couch.

1048
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,820
 I was in Waco, Texas and I was sitting there

1049
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,580
 and it was like the scales had fallen from my eyes,

1050
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,700
 like I was living in the Matrix.

1051
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,100
 I'm like, none of this is real.

1052
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,180
 Jesus is gonna come back and finish the work here.

1053
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,540
 What else matters?

1054
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,380
 What am I gonna do?

1055
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,100
 I should just start sharing the gospel

1056
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,220
 with every breathing person alive.

1057
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,720
 I should give away all my money

1058
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,380
 and leverage it for the kingdom.

1059
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,140
 I should begin to live completely

1060
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
 and radically sold out for him.

1061
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,980
 God began to do a work in my life.

1062
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,860
 What else are you gonna live for?

1063
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,480
 Is it true?

1064
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,820
 If it's not true, then you are wasting your time here

1065
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,060
 on a Tuesday night.

1066
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,100
 You need to be, they got $2 margaritas out there, man.

1067
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,660
 You need to go just shred it.

1068
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,620
 Go hard.

1069
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,340
 Sin more.

1070
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,360
 Experience more momentary pleasure.

1071
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,540
 Guys will love you.

1072
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,420
 They will use you and abuse you.

1073
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,720
 They will delight in your body.

1074
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,420
 Drink it up.

1075
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,220
 Girls, man, pull out your wallet

1076
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,140
 and buy them some drinks and soak in their attention

1077
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,580
 like there's nothing else.

1078
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:36,780
 But if it's true, you stop it.

1079
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,260
 And you start living for him.

1080
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,260
 Because anything else you do is a complete

1081
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,660
 and total waste of your life,

1082
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,860
 waste of your talents, waste of who you are.

1083
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,360
 In fact, it's not who you are.

1084
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,220
 It's not who you are.

1085
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,060
 It's your heads.

1086
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,740
 Let me pray that you would know that.

1087
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,820
 Father, would you help us to believe that we're yours?

1088
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,480
 Would you help us to live for you?

1089
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,620
 Would you help us to know you?

1090
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,400
 Would you help us to walk with you?

1091
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,820
 I pray, God, please, right now,

1092
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,220
 that you're recruiting your remnant,

1093
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,420
 that you're pulling them together here in Dallas

1094
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,620
 and in Fort Worth and in Tulsa and in El Paso

1095
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,900
 and in Oklahoma and in Houston and Houston

1096
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,420
 and then in South Africa and Australia

1097
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,700
 and in Rhode Island and all of the places

1098
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,340
 where people are listening right now.

1099
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,400
 You're just recruiting your remnant, God,

1100
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,620
 that we would lock arms

1101
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,220
 and that we would live radically for you tomorrow, God.

1102
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,700
 That we would boldly declare there is a truth

1103
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,260
 and I know him and I'm gonna live for him.

1104
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,120
 Because, God, you, we are, God, we are who you say we are.

1105
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
 Sons and daughters, not slaves.

1106
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,760
 We are who you say we are, God.

1107
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,560
 Your sons and daughters, princes and princesses,

1108
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,000
 not slaves to this world, not slaves to our sin,

1109
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,600
 not slaves to Satan.

1110
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,640
 We're yours, God, and you're enough.

1111
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,180
 And you're enough.

1112
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,880
 Would you remind us of that?

1113
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,720
 Amen.
