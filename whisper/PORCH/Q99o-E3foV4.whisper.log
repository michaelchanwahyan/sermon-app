[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000]   >> Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [ Cheering ]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Let's go.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Let's go.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500]   So good to be with you.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000]   Brilliant video, by the way.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Brilliant video.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Man, let's give those guys a hand.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Porch Arts Team, Team Landscape.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   If we don't know each other, I got to spend, I guess, a little over a decade up here just kind of having a front row seat, learning about young adults,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   very passionate about the topic of relationships, made a ton of mistakes.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I'm going to share some of those with you today, still make mistakes on occasions.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I'll share some of those with you today.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But I want to take you back to me in my sophomore year in high school.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I'm in anatomy class, all right, anatomy and physiology.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Anybody take anatomy?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I was failing.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I desperately needed to pass this class to graduate or to have to take it again the next year.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Had a huge crush on this girl.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I'm going to change her name, okay, to protect the innocent.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Kelly, we'll call her.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Huge crush on Kelly, all right.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   The sun would come in through the window, hit her just right.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Her blonde hair, like everything was just in place.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Like there were no crazy wispies, you know.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It was just like everything, and she would sometimes like kind of throw it back,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and it would throw this scent in my nose.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   She just smelled good, you know.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   She always had style.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And every now and then she'd like turn around.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm two rows behind her.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   She has these huge dimples, you know, and I'd catch a glimpse of that smile.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It made me just feel all kinds of crazy ways.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I'm failing the class because I'm studying the wrong anatomy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so here's what's going to happen.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   There is a big project, and I need to get an A on this project to pass the class.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's all coming down to this moment, and the teacher is pairing people up.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   A guy with a girl, a guy with a girl, a guy with a girl.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So I become very religious, and I start, "Lord in heaven, God,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   please put me with Kelly.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   God, please, like if you can hear me, put me--partner us up.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   May she be my partner.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Lord, would you please do that?"
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Teacher, Ms. Peruthi, starts going around the room, you know,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   "Jennifer and Sean, Kimberly and Travis, Kelly,"
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and I'm like, "And Jonathan and Jonathan and Jonathan."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That's my real name.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   "And Jonathan," and she says, "And Jonathan."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   [applause]
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Like this is the story we're going to tell people.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You know, they're going to be like, "How did y'all meet?"
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   When our two kids, Tyler and, you know, a cool girl's name.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   When we're just hanging--they'll be like, "How'd you meet?"
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'll be like, "Well, we were in anatomy class," you know.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And so there we are.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We're partnered up.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   This is awesome, and here's the problem.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I didn't consider the assignment.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I didn't know the assignment.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We were going to be dissecting frogs,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   and we were going to be graded on our partner's participation,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   how we got to share responsibilities.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Now, I knew how Kelly's hair smelled.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I knew about her dimples.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I knew about her style.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I didn't know that she didn't like frogs.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   She didn't want to touch any kind of frogs,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   especially the dead ones.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   She didn't want to get frog juice on her, right?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And here's what that meant is when we kind of partnered up
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and we got the scalpel and we stood at the table,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   she didn't want anything to do with it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I was like, "No, no, no, no.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You don't understand.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I need you to be really, really good at this."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And she's like, "That's too bad.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm not touching that thing."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And so I failed the class.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I want to ask you two questions up front.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Why did I fail the class?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Because I didn't understand the assignment.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   On what criteria did I want Kelly to be my partner
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   for the assignment?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   What was she bringing to the table?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   What would you say?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   She was pretty.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That was the skills and capabilities that she had there
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   in anatomy class.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   She was pretty.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And I'm here to tell you that her beauty did not benefit me
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   at all when it comes to dissecting a frog
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   or the assignment that was in front of us.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I think when it comes to marriage,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that men do not consider the assignment
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   when they're choosing a partner.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I believe this is one of the biggest problems
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   in dating today, that we have been brainwashed
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to look for the wrong things.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I get it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You want her to look like Zendaya or Kendall Jenner,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   have Sadie's faith and Taylor's game, right?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And you want her to work out and be fit
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   but not be able to beat you in pig, right?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so you have all of this criteria.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You want her to have style but not kind of out,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   you know, to look good at the party with you.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You want your boys to be jealous that you're with her.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And if you're honest, your number one criteria,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   even in those of you that have studied the Scripture,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   you've memorized the Bible, you go to church,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   you're a member, you're in a small group,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   your number one criteria is how she looks.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's not serving you well.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I was enslaved to pornography.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Enslaved to it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I would take off work to look at porn.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I am here to tell you that that epidemic
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   is bleeding throughout the culture
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and ruining your marriage
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   long before you even met your girlfriend,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   long before you've even met the prospect.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And you continue to move through that.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   You struggle with porn and masturbation
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and all of a sudden you look up and you're like,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   "How long have I been struggling with this?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   "Oh, it's been since the fifth grade
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   "and I've not done anything about it."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And so we're in this series, his and hers.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And today I want to talk, tonight I want to talk with you
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   about his pursuit of a wife.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   The message is what to look for, guys.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   The message is who to be, ladies.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Right when I say that, who to be, ladies,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   shame, guilt, oh, here we go, eye roll.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   You know, this is you, Proverbs 31.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Calm down, I know, I heard you.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   All right, calm down, take a deep breath.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I've got no agenda.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Whoever finds a wife finds what is good
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and receives favor from the Lord, Proverbs 18.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Men, if you're here and you desire a wife,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I want you to find what is good.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's not arrogance, I hope it's not.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I hope I can stand before you in all humility.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I care deeply about you.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I'm so sick of doing marriage counseling.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I'm so sick of talking someone through divorce.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I'm a simple guy, okay, I'm not the smartest guy in the room,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   but I have seen a lot of relationships.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I've seen what works, I've seen what doesn't.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I've studied a culture, I've seen where we're moving.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I've had the opportunity to write a book on this, okay.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I've arranged couples, I've done more marriages,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   more weddings than I can count.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's who's talking to you.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I'm not saying that to boast, I'm just saying, listen,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and by the way, for the last 20-something years,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I've been a student of this book,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and I have found it just proven perfectly
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   when it comes to relationships.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You do what it says, you are blessed.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   You go against what it says, it doesn't go well for you.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Time and time and time and time again, test me.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I'll be right here afterwards, and I don't mean this arrogantly.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm not picking a fight with you.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm just saying I'll be right here afterwards.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   If I'm wrong about any of that, you come right here, show me.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I'll stop saying it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I'll stop saying it.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   But if you find something true in here,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   because some of you, you've got an attitude,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and it's just going to keep you single.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And then all of a sudden you act like you don't want marriage.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Yeah, I don't even need that.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   I don't even need no guy.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I'm like, good, that's going to work out for you.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   You know?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And my only heart is to help you.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Okay, I'm not the bad guy.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So when I say something and it sounds old-fashioned,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   hang in there with me.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Be patient with me.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Let me explain it.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I am indeed going to be in your favorite chapter of Proverbs 31.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   When I was your age,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and I'm always hesitant to tell too much of my story.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I mean, like I'll tell you anything,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   but I think people are going to be like, well, it worked out for you.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You don't understand the scars.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You don't understand the pain.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   You don't understand the sleepless nights.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You don't understand the anxiety.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You don't understand the road to this point.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Okay, when I was your age,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I was so enslaved to pornography that I wanted someone that looked like a porn star.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Because I thought, I was just so dumb,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   that I thought marriage was about sex,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and I thought sex was better with an attractive person.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Now some of you are going to be thinking about that for the rest of the time.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Is it better than with a--
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Come back with me.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Here's the problem.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   In marriage, if you have a healthy, thriving sex life,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   a healthy, thriving, better than average sex life,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   you're going to have sex 0.6% of the time.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   That's 0.6% of the time.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Okay, so you better be really good at the other 99.4% stuff.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Okay, yeah, preach it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You've got to be really, really good at that stuff.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Okay, so let's dive in.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'm going to be in Proverbs 31.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Let me set this up.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   As you guys think about who you're looking for,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I just see so much paralysis by analysis.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   You have this fear of missing out.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Well, what if I pass up--
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   What if I commit myself to her and then someone else better comes along?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Someone else better will come along.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   There's always someone prettier, someone nicer, someone kinder,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   someone who likes you more.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   You're always going to meet that person.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You're not trying to find the best person.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You're trying to find a godly person, a God-fearing person,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   someone who God has her heart.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And I'm just telling you, if you can flip that switch in your mind,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   it's going to serve you very well.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Proverbs 31 was not written to women.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Contrary to popular belief, it was written to men.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Anyone know who wrote it?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Huh?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Solomon.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   King Lemuel.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   King Lemuel is a popular answer.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I thought that for a long time.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Did you know we have no historical evidence of a king named Lemuel?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   That that name means "devoted to God,"
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   which means these words that you're about to read were spoken probably by Solomon's mom,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   who is a character that you may have heard of named Bathsheba.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Proverbs 31 is a poem.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It's an acrostic.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   There's 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And so as you work down the line, every sentence starts with the first Hebrew letter,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   like "A" is for apple, as an example.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   That's the kind of poem that Proverbs 31 is.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And it's to teach you, and when we start here in verse 10,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   it's to instruct a guy of what the golden standard of a woman is.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Now, ladies, listen, because I'm going to say this a few times,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   because afterwards you're going to say, "I didn't say it enough."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It's not all non-negotiables.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It's okay.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Like if some of them, you're like, "Oh, I fall short there."
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   That's okay.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's okay.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   God is still good.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It doesn't mean that you're cursed and no one's ever going to find you.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   That's not what that means.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   There may be some things that I say that you go, "Oh, I can work on that."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "Oh, yeah, I bet I can get better at that."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   "Oh, there might be some areas for improvement."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   There's really only two non-negotiables today, and the first one is for the guys.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So I'm going to give you six points.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It's a note-taker sermon.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Write these down, okay?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Six things to look for in a wife.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Six things to be as a wife or a prospect of a wife,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and the first one is actually for the guys, and that will make more sense in a minute.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   The promise of this text, you find this woman, it says, for guys, it says this, verse 23,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   "Her husband is respected at the city gate where he takes his seat among the elders of the land."
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Ladies, free advice.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Men want to feel respected.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That's universal across the board.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's the way God made us.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   We have this deep desire to feel respected.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And then for the ladies, it says in verse 28, "Her children arise and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praises her.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gates."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Men, women want to be cherished.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   There's a deep desire in them.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   God placed it there for them to be treated like a princess,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   for you to love them and cherish them and bless them and honor them and keep them.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And that is the offering of this text, if you can understand it.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   But the problem is, guys, we don't know what we're looking for.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And most people in marriage, and I've done this study, and I've done survey after survey after survey after survey,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   of tens of thousands of people, most people are looking for a feeling.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I want to meet someone who makes me feel special.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And at the root of that is narcissism, and it's not working out for us as a culture,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   as people are getting married later, people are getting married less, and marriages aren't lasting.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And I just want to help you from the Scripture.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So six qualities to look for.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I'll start in verse 10.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It says this, "A wife of noble character, who can find she is worth far more than rubies?"
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And where it says noble character, it means a capable wife.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And where it says who can find there, guys, this is really important.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You're to find her, which means how do you find something?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   You have to look for them.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So some of you think you're playing PlayStation 5, she's going to fall through the roof on your lap
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   because you've got a really healthy prayer life, and that's not how it works.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You've got to shoot your shot.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You have to say, "Hey, would you like to go on a date with me?"
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   You can use those words, it removes all the confusion.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think you are really interesting.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I've observed you from afar, not in the stalker kind of way.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And I would like to take you on a date.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And so you can say yes, no, or let me think about it, but there is the proposition.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   "Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It's speaking to her worth and to her value.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   So guys, this first one of the six, this one is yours.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   The rest are for the ladies.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   This one is yours.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   You shouldn't even start looking for a wife until you view women as priceless.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Until you rightfully understand their value, you should not even begin to look for a wife.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Porn is going to tell you they're worthless.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They're a sex toy for your pleasure.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Look at a two-dimensional image and have your way from this buffet or this hub of all kinds of dark desires that are ruining you.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And it is a worship of Satan.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And I'm begging you to stop.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It is amazing. Consider this.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   What if all the people in here, and women, it's a women problem too.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   What if you walk through those doors in just a minute and you never look at porn again?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What if the only pair of breasts you see until you're face-to-face with Jesus are your wives?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   What if you never even watch a movie again with nudity?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   You take it that -- you can do that.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It is available to you.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I've done it. I've gotten there.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I've fought vigilantly.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I've gone from every single day to that, like, gone behind me.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   When I'm tempted, I confess, I ask for a prayer.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   If I see something I shouldn't, I'm watching a movie, comes across.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Hey, guys, here's what just happened.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Would you pray for me?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Would you help me?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Guys, it's available to you.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   You can do it.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I know you're like, I can't.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I'm struggling.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   How are you struggling?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   How do you look at porn?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Where's your phone?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Euphoria is not going to help you see her as priceless.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   You taking dating advice from Post Malone, not going to help you see her as priceless.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Stop it.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Please.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Please.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   1 Thessalonians 4 says this.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins as we told you and warned you before,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   for God did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   That is a stern warning from the Scripture.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Holy Spirit, preserve that for you tonight.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   It's ironic that I would be teaching this to you today.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I didn't sleep well last night.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I don't feel real well if I'm honest.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I got in a conversation with Monica, that's my wife, we've been married 18 years, right before bed.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And it's been a really busy season, really hectic, a little chaotic.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And she just said this to me, and it really crushed me, honestly.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   She said, "Hey, I don't feel super valued by you right now."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And I just thought, really all night, I mean at 3 in the morning I was thinking,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   "What have I done?"
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Like I'm going to tell all of these young adults that their view of women is priceless,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   and my wife is telling me she doesn't feel valued.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I've got to change this.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And I asked her forgiveness.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   And you guys can pray for us.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   She would feel that I would make her feel priceless.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Verse 13, "She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Flax is used to make linen.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Eager hands means she enjoys her work.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   "She is like the merchant ships bringing her food from afar."
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   She's setting the table for the family.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's not hamburger helper, like she's done work.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   "She gets up while it is still night.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   She provides food for her family and portions for her female servants."
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   She's able to assess the needs and meet the needs.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   "She considers a field and buys it.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Out of her earnings, she plants a vineyard.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   She sets about her work vigorously.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Her arms are strong for her task."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   She's got big arms. Put that on the list.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   "She sees that her trading is profitable.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And her lamp does not go out at night.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   In her hands, she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers."
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   That's something you would use to make clothes.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And then verse 24 says, "She makes linen garments and sells them
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and supplies the merchants with sashes."
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Girl boss, man.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I mean, truly, she's corporate.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I mean, she's doing stuff right here.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   My second point is she's resourceful.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   You want to look for someone who is resourceful.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I'm not saying that she has more than 3,000 followers and she's super fun.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I'm saying that she can figure out how to feed a family with an empty pantry.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   She looks at a challenge and she meets it.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Genesis 2 says you're looking for a helper,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   that God made women to help men.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And women thinks that's really chauvinistic.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I think it's pretty insulting to men because it says we need help.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And that word "helper," as you are offended, be careful,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   because that word "ezer" in the Hebrew is the same word used to describe the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It's the same word for God.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   God is our helper.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   So it's not an insult at all.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It's actually a compliment.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   You would come alongside somebody
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   and you would not complete them but compliment them.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Here's the truth, friends.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Marriage is much more pragmatic than you ever want to admit.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's two people partnering together in life because life is hard.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And it's easier when you have a partner that's good at things that you're not good at.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And that's why I say this.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Much of the rest of the list until we get to the last one, they're not necessary.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   If you're like, "Hey, I'm not very good at this," great. Find someone who is.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   So you guys can compliment each other.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   She's solving problems here. She's on it.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   She's a room mom. She's making clothes.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   She's planting. She's cooking. She's trading. She's selling.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I'm not saying that you have to marry Suzy Hallmaker.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   But I am saying you want to audit what am I bringing to the table,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   and I want to make sure that if I don't have it,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   that I find someone with it so that we can compliment each other in this.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   In our marriage, neither of us really like to cook.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And so this is where we find ourselves 18 years in.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I'm no chef, and she's great at a lot of things.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   That's just not one of them.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And so we eat out a lot, and we need to go in eyes wide open,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   understanding this is the lot that we have for ourselves,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   or we need to take some cooking classes, which we haven't done yet.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It says she makes sure the needs of her family are met.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Does she like kids? How do you know?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Does she serve in children's ministry?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Does she want to keep your sister's kids?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Or is she like, "No, I don't really want a family,"
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   because sometimes that can be a sign of selfishness.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   "I don't want anyone to put me out."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   No, it's like, "Hey, I don't really want a family because I want to be the best aunt ever."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   That's different.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   "I don't want a family because I want to use our home as a foster house."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Oh, man, that's way different.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   "I don't want my own family because we're just going to create this discipleship hub in the community."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   That's amazing.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   "I don't want my own family because I want to be a dog mom."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   That's different.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Yeah, that's--you know, and so you want to be aware,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   because here you say, "Well, do I have to want kids?"
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   You have to view kids as a blessing.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   That's Psalm 127.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Children are a blessing from the Lord.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   That's what the Scripture says.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   If the Scripture is authoritative in your life,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   so much of marriage is about discipleship in the home.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I think we think of marriage like, "Oh, I got someone fun to go to Paris with."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   David.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Just kidding, dude.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Just kidding.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   No, but marriage is so much about discipleship.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And so you want to go in eyes wide open.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   You want to understand the assignment.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I've got a job.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I've had different jobs, corporate America, worked for AT&T.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I've sold different things along the way.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I've, you know, served with the porch ministry.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I've served in this church, and then I have the privilege of pastoring a church.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Some would say my job is hard, lots of travel, you know, hearing people's problems,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   those kinds of things.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Here's the deal.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   My wife, she works in the home as a mom, takes the kids to school.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Right now she just picked one up from a basketball game.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I saw that text right before I walked up.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I don't want to trade her not at all.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Like her job is so much harder than mine.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   In fact, sometimes, like every now and then she'll travel, and I'll have to do her job.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Like I've become this overnight Uber driver, and I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And I write my letter of resignation before noon, but then I don't have anyone to give it to.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And so it's hard work.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And if you don't like hard work, you're not going to like marriage because it's hard work.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   You're like, well, being single is hard.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Being married is probably harder.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   You're like, well, you don't know.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   You weren't single.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   What?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I wasn't.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I indeed was single as a young adult in Dallas, Texas.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Absolutely, I was.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy, verse 20.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   This shows her compassion.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Number three, she's empathetic.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   She's not bossy with an attitude.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Some guys are like looking for that, which is weird.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Like I want a diva, you know.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Where's the gentle and quiet spirit in that?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's a strange day we live in.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   I want someone who is super bossy.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That's weird.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Does she text encouraging things to people when they need it?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Does she write notes?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Does she give to those in need?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Does she serve?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Is she always looking to serve?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   That word serve is really important.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Genesis 24, when Abraham sends Eleazar to find a wife for his son, Eleazar goes to look.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Like this is how they did it in the olden days.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   He's like hey, go find me a wife.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   He's like well, what if there's no chemistry?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   We'll figure it out.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   He's like hey, go find him a wife.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Goes where all of the people go to serve, the well.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And God says to him, find the one who will get you water, which was hard in that day.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You have to hike all the way down the well, back up, and then give water to your camels.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Find the person who serves.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And some of you are like, oh, that's chauvinistic.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   You're saying that I have to be a servant.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   No, I'm saying Jesus was the chief servant again.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You get to carry the character traits of God.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And in Ephesians 5, it says the man's job is to sacrifice, that he's to die for you.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   So if your husband, future husband ever says, see, the Bible says you're to submit to me, just elbow him back.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He says, well, the Bible says you're to die.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   My bride's super sensitive to the needs of others.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It's her superpower.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   She walks into a room, finds the most vulnerable person, moves to them, and meets their needs.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Sometimes it's the elderly.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Sometimes it's a baby.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Sometimes it's a sick person.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   She has no regard, no fear of getting sick herself.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   She will go.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   She will hug them.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   She will love them.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   She will make soup for them.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Like this is who she is.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   It's amazing to watch her do it.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   One of the biggest challenges, actually, in our marriage, truly, the biggest fights we've had have been because about six years ago, we got a labradoodle for Christmas.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And she cares so much for that dog.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I mean, she wants the water to be a comfortable temperature.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So she'll put ice cubes in it.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Yeah, that's my bride.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And she doesn't want her to be lonely, so she'll leave the TV on.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   You know?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   So, right, this is -- she cares deeply for the comfort of this animal.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And it drives me crazy, but I'm so thankful for that character trait because I see it when our kids are sick all night.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And it costs her nothing to go without sleep, to care for those children, to do whatever it takes to make sure everyone in our home is safe.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Everyone in our home is comfortable.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Verse 21, "When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   She makes coverings for her bed.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   She is clothed in fine linen and purple."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   This is something about aesthetics here because it's talking about she's clothed in scarlet, she covers her bed, she's clothed in fine linen and purple.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   These were, like, really expensive colors.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I would say number four, from the scripture, and it's kind of a strange one, she's tasteful.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   She's tasteful.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I'm not saying, like, she has $600 shoes and lip injections, like, Insta-Filler.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I'm saying she makes things pretty, which is just a fact.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Guys, when you get married, like, right now, here's the weird thing.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Right now, on your bed, there is one pillow.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Okay?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Maybe, maybe you're one of those dudes, you got two, right?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   On my bed right now, I've got 11 pillows.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   My pillows have pillows.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I've got pillows for pillows, right?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Like, you may have a mat in front of your door.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I've got rugs stacked on top of rugs.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   I've got rugs rugging rugs.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Like, I don't even know what the rug underneath is doing, right?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   But there's just something about the aesthetics that my wife brings to the table.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And so, ladies, you know we need help here, right?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Because you've been in his apartment, and you're like, "Do you mind if I use the restroom?"
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And you walk in, and then you walk out.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Because you're like, "What is that science experiment in there?"
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You're growing mold.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   And you pull out dishes out of the cabinet, and you're like, "Have you washed these?"
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And he's like, "Yeah, I wiped them off."
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   "No, but in the dishwasher, like hot water."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And he's like, "Oh, is that necessary?"
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And so, we need some help in this area.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   But right about now, some of you ladies are like, "Actually, I'm really dirty. Oh, no. He's going to call me out."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   We know you're here.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   [Laughter]
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And I would just say, "That's fine."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   But you're probably going to want to find somebody who's clean.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Otherwise, no one's going to come see you guys.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   [Laughter]
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Again, not all non-negotiables.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Suggestions.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Things to consider.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   We just built a house.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Everyone walks in our home, the second home we built.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Everyone walks in and says, "Hey, Monica, did you get to pick out all this stuff?"
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Here's the truth. I care about that way more than she does.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And so, sometimes it's just different.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And so, the only degree I have is in art.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   I care about the aesthetics.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And so, that's okay.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   You can play those different roles in your marriage.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   It's not a sin.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Verse 25.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   "She is clothed with strength and dignity.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   She can laugh at the days to come.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness."
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   She's not lazy.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   She doesn't eat the bread of idleness.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   There's this preparedness in this text.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   She's clothed with strength and dignity.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   There's the days to come.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Number five, she's thoughtful.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Webster's defined these words as giving careful consideration to opportunities.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   She is thoughtful.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   If her primary concern is self-care, right, she might be selfish.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   If she's constantly thinking about the next Manny and Petty over who else she can care for,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I don't know that she's going to be the best wife for you.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   But the problem is, you're like, "But I really like her fingernails shiny."
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And that's cool, all right?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   But you want to give careful consideration to is she thoughtful, right?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And so if you're not prepared, if you're not thoughtful, you're here, you're a woman,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   you're like, "Hey, that's just not my gift.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I'm artsy," you know, that's fine.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   But you're probably going to want to find a guy who is.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Or your bills aren't going to get paid.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And your electricity gets turned off.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And your home gets foreclosed on.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And you're like, "He was right.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I should have found somebody who was thoughtful."
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And she needs to plan well, not OCD.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It's okay if she's spontaneous.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Enneagram 7s can make good wives, right?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Yeah, she's here.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I'm just saying, and here's the good news, lady.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Let me tell you something crazy.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Let me tell you something crazy.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I'm an Enneagram 7, by the way.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Yeah, me and you.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And you can grow through this.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Like, it is a learned skill.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Like, the Holy Spirit can produce this in your life.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Like, you can become less self-centered, more others-focused.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   You can even grow in your ability to plan.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Like, I -- this season's been crazy.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   So, in the last five weeks, we've gone to four weddings.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I just got back from Colorado.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I didn't even unpack the bag.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I just threw in an extra sweatshirt, turned around, got back in the truck,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   drove up here to Dallas.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's just been a whirlwind.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And I'm not the best planner.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   I may be the worst on the face of the earth.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And on our island, in our kitchen, is a calendar, an old-school one with, like,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   boxes and numbers.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And beside the calendar is a thing of markers, six of them.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   They're all different colors.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And my wife does work on that calendar every single night.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   She stands there at the island, and she just starts crossing stuff out and
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   stuff, and she's doing calculus over there.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But it's greens and blues and purples and oranges, and everything's color-coded.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And she makes sure all the planes land on time.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And, like, she's like, "Hey, don't forget, porch tomorrow.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   You need to be there by this time, you know?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Hey, you're going to stay here, and then you're going to come back."
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And this is super helpful to me.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And people are like, "Does your wife work?"
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I'm like, "Absolutely, more than I do."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Absolutely she does.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Verse 30, "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Lord is to be praised."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You guys care so much about chemistry and beauty.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   How does the Scripture value beauty?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   You've got to answer that question in your heart.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And then maybe say, "Man, what if I'm off?"
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Because I know, you understand, I've had these conversations, like, literally
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   hundreds of times.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Like, "Wait, is it not important?
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I don't understand.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Am I supposed to take one for the team?"
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   And I would just say, yeah, like, it can be important.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Like, here's an example.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   This is kind of a sermon within a sermon, right?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Think about your hand.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Everybody give me a hand right here.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Just put up a hand.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   This will be helpful to you, okay?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   You're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Here's some things to consider.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Your thumb, it's an opposable thumb.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   You can't pick something up without it, all right?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   It sits on the other side of these fingers.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So you want someone complimentary, like someone who compliments you,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   like someone who has gifts where you don't and you have gifts where they don't.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Like your thumb.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Okay, your pointer finger, this is like how you give direction.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   You want someone going the same direction as you, all right?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   You're both running hard after Jesus together.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   You're equally yoked, okay?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   This middle finger, this is something you can communicate something with really fast, all right?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Communication is important in marriage, all right?
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Communication really matters.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   You want someone that you communicate with.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   This ring finger, this is your finger of commitment, commitment.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   You want someone who's committed to you.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   They're not going to go outside the marriage.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   This pinky, it's attractive.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You want someone you're attracted to, okay?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Now, pinky is important.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Like I'd rather not go through life without it.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But, I mean, if I've got to lose a finger, you know, take the pinky, right?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And so there's a place for it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's just not first, second, third, or fourth place, all right?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And so many of you guys have put it in the first place.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And it's why the divorce rate's what it is.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It's why your marriage satisfaction rate is what it is.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Guys, I'm trying to help you guys, okay?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   There's a place for it, but it's just not first, second, third, or fourth place, right?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   The most beautiful girl you know may be a miserable wife.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And the 17th most beautiful girl you know may be the best wife ever.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Pay attention.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Look for her.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Number six, is she yielded to God?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Is she yielded to God, meaning does everything in her life stop as she fears the Lord?
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   She's a woman who fears the Lord.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   She is to be praised.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Ladies, you may be feeling beat down right about now.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And I would just say this one is the only non-negotiable for you.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Actually, if the Holy Spirit comes in your life, he can reduce some of those other things.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   You have to have this one.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   This is the non-negotiable.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Your life has to be yielded to God.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   When I met my wife, neither one of us were following Jesus.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And we were both miserable at these list of things.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Neither of us--we were both self-centered.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   We would have made miserable spouses.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   What happened is I stumbled into this place.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   I was at a club in Dallas 20 years ago.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Someone invited me to watermark.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I sat in the back row, hung over, smelled like smoke from the night before.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And I ended up surrendering my life to Jesus.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Here's what that means.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   I looked at the cross, and I thought, "Oh, that was a payment for my sins."
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   He paid for my porn addiction.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   I don't have to suffer in eternity for my porn addiction.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   He paid for my alcoholism.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   I don't have to suffer in eternity for my--
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   He paid for my drug use.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I don't have to suffer--He paid for my materialism.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And I realized he went in the grave in an event that the whole world acknowledges.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   He showed back up to life.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And this carpenter born in Bethlehem, lived in Nazareth,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   became the single most polarizing character in the history of history.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Every atheist you know acknowledges him by the date they put on their checks.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   2,022 years ago he was born.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   He reset the calendar.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And when Monica and I gave our lives to that reality,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   the Holy Spirit, God himself, came and lived within us and began to produce fruit--
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And so you understand this is the most important thing.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Are you--and you know if you are or not.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   You know how worldly you are.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You know what your struggles are.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Are you yielded to God?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   And if you're not, right now can be that moment where you just say,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   "God, I know that you died for my sins.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   I know that you raised from the dead.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   I surrender my life to you right now.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Would you send your Holy Spirit in me to produce these things that I cannot produce on my own?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I can't leave here and by my bootstraps just produce this by my own grit.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I need your help, Holy Spirit."
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And he will do it.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I've seen him do it.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I know he can do it.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   I did an arranged marriage.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   It's very controversial, evidently.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I don't know why it was controversial, but I did one.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I wrote a book on dating.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And as a part of that, I've always been a fan of arranged marriages because they're biblical.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And I just said, "Hey, I'm going to arrange a marriage."
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And so that's a true story.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I know some of you are like, "What, is he crazy?"
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   No, I really did.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I'm not joking.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   It's not a joke.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We had, you know, well over 1,000 applicants.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And we put together a team to go through those applicants.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And I just want to let you in on how we did it, okay?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   We tried to find the most godly guy and the most godly girl.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   That's all we did.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   We didn't care what they looked like.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   We didn't care what they did.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Like, that was it.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   It was just like who, based on these questions, then we interviewed friends and their families.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   We kind of narrowed it down.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   We tried to find the most godly guy and the most godly girl.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And we did.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And I told them to come over.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   They met at my house in my living room.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   They each brought their friends with them, which was really cool.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And then, you know, she lived in Houston.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   He lived in Del Rio.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He's in the Air Force.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   There were a lot of things working against them.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   But as they realized the Holy Spirit was at work in their life, they got married.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   True story.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Like, they're happily married right now.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And so just kind of like what it does is solidify things I've been saying for a really long time.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   What am I, just supposed to marry the most godliest person I know?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Sure.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Yeah, do that.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   You would be so much better off than marrying the hottest person you know.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Okay?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   The richest person you know.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   The smartest person you know.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   You will win every time, 10 for 10, out of any of that other stuff.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Isn't that mind-blowing?
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Wait, hold on.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   What did he say?
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I said, "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Because that's what the scripture said.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I want to redefine what is pretty.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I want to redefine what is pretty.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Do you see her in summary?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Do you see her as priceless, guys?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Is she resourceful?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Is she empathetic?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Is she tasteful?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Is she thoughtful?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Is she yielded to God?
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Okay?
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Can we redefine what is pretty?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   [Applause]
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   High school is funny.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   You get to see where people end up.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Kelly, she married a guy who wasn't a Christian.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Kind of followed along through Facebook, you know.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   They struggled in life.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   It's been hard.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   It's been a tough go.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I think about who I didn't want to be with.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Jennifer was in there.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I changed her name too.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   She had acne.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   She was a little overweight.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   She was kind of dressed, frumpy clothes, you know.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   She's smart.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   She understood the assignment.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Whoever partnered with Jennifer won.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   They got an A.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   She passed.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   I think she was salutatorian actually.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I get to see where she goes in life.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   She found a guy who loves Jesus.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   They got married.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   The Holy Spirit is at work in their life.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Lots of happiness in their home.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Lots of love.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Lots of joy.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Lots of peace.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Lots of patience.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Lots of goodness.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Lots of faithfulness.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And lots of self-control.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Gentlemen, I've been saying this for 15 years.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And I'm not going to stop and I'm going to say it again tonight.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Because I've seen it serve people really well.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It's the truth.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   If you're here and you love Jesus, men.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   If you're doing well.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   You're walking in purity.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You're praying.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   You're reading the Bible.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   You're in community.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Doing life with other people.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   You're a member of a church.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   You're serving.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   That's you.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And you desire marriage.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   If you don't desire marriage, no problem.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You can be single for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   That's amazing.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Amazing.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   And I want you to marry her.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I'm kidding.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Don't marry her.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   [Laughter]
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   How about we start with asking her out.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And so here's the words.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I'm going to give them to you because you'll get nervous.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   You can write them down if you want.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Will you go on a date with me?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   [Laughter]
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Okay.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And you can even use me if you want.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I don't mind being that guy.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   You can say, hey, so JP at the porch said I'm supposed to ask you out.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That's fine.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   You can totally run that game.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   That's all good.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Yeah, so my pastor said that I'm supposed to take you on a date.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And just see how it goes.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Ladies, for God's sake, man asked you out.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Go to coffee with him.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   If you don't want to go again, that's okay.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Tell him why.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Use words.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Be specific.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Say, hey, as I'm seeking a husband,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   you're not what I'm looking for.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But I'm thankful.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Just honor him.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Be respectful.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   But you can use words.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   We can be adults.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   It's okay.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   You know?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   And so that's my prayer for you.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   I pray that it would happen.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I'm not trying to create insecurities.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Like ladies, we'll leave here.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Like nobody asked you out.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   You're like, I must not be godly.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   It's not what it means.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   It's not what it means.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   God sees you.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   He hasn't forsaken you.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He hasn't forgotten you.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   He's with you.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   He's for you.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   He's got you.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Okay?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Pray.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Don't obsess.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Continue to work on these things.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Ask the Holy Spirit to work on these things in you.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   And my prayer is it will go well for you.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Let me pray that it would.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Lord, would you just, if nothing else,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   help us to surrender to the truth of who you are
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and what you did for us through your son.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   We love you.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And we're thankful that you love us.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And there is an epidemic among us where we obsess with the pretty.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Would you help us to define it, redefine it,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   in a way that honors you?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Thank you for this text that you've preserved that is helpful,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   written not for women but for men,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   to know what the golden standard is of what you would have for us.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   We love you, God.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   We praise you, God.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   We ask this and all things in the name of your son, Jesus.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.060]   you
