00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Fayetteville, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas, Cedar Rapids,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Iowa, El Paso, Fort Worth, Boise, Idaho, and all the Ports

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 and all the Ports, live locations, everybody tuning in

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 online.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We are doing something special tonight.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Let me start us off by telling a story that happened this past

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 week that will give us direction for where we are going to go.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 There is something that has come on the scene, I don't know if

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 it's the past two years, five years, or just I missed it for

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 like a decade and it's been here for a while.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It's called an escape room.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Anyone familiar with an escape room?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is a thing.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 If you are not familiar, it's basically you pay somebody $200

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 to lock you in a closet and figure out how to get out of

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 there.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And they are making a killing off of this thing.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 It's a team bonding experience.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 This past week we went to an escape room, Escapeology, in

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 the heart of Dallas.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Went in there and given the instructions on our room.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And we go into this room.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 If you have never been in one, you have to figure out how to

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 break -- you have to figure out the mystery.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I really should have thought this through.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I was going to explain it.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You have to think through how to get out.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You have to follow certain clues and read and diagram in order to

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 solve the mystery.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Ours was a murder mystery.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 You have to solve who murdered the person in order to get the

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 eventual code that allows you out of the room.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 But there's all these different turns and things that are

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 involved in trying to figure out the story.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So it's you and five people.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You have one hour to make it happen.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And you're trying to get it done.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 This was the most challenging escape room I have ever even

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 heard of.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Whoever came up with this thing intentionally made it to where

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 it would be impossible to get out of there without asking for

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 clues or asking for help.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 In other words, in the escape room, you can hit a button at

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 any time and say, hey, we're stuck.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Give us some way of getting out of here.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Give us the next clue.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Because we can't make the next thing.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And this one was so challenging.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I was insulted by the clues they would give.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Turn this thing around.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There's Braille in the background.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You want to figure out how to read Hebrew.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And walk through it.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And you thought we were going to get here on our own by doing

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 this.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Every single time it was designed to where without help from the

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 outside you were not getting out.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And you thought, what does that have to do with what we are

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 talking about tonight.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We are in a season of life, just in general as our country and

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 really for the last number of months where a lot of us have

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 felt like in life we are stuck.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're covered in anxiety.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 The rates of suicide.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I was reading it before and talking with a friend.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 One in four young adults in the last 90 days have contemplated

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 suicide.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Things have gotten so bad and so overwhelmed and so anxious.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 They thought about ending their life.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 One in four.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Think about that.

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Antidepressants are up 600% since COVID hit.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 The number of young adults before COVID who were

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 experiencing anxiety was through the roof and now it's just

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 exploded.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And all of us coming to the room with different degrees to the

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 level of which we are feeling anxious, uncertain, overwhelmed.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And we're stuck in our head.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And what I want to do for the next handful of minutes is talk

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 through what it looks like to conquer some of that anxiety and

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 those anxious and fearful thoughts and conquer the toxic

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 thinking.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Because so often people will -- in attempting to help people

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 get unstuck from overwhelmed and trapped in my head and sad and

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 battling depression.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 People come along and well-meaning and give messages,

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and positive things.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Sometimes pastors who go into a self-help mode.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 While it may feel good in the moment, it doesn't lead to

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 transformation.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And it makes me think no weapon formed against me will stand.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I will conquer this and get the job and not get sick and

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 everything is perfect.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And then it doesn't happen.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And those truths were never helpful and didn't help me get

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 out of the room.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And I'm going to do something positive.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 But what if there was a way to get help from the outside?

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And by that I don't mean a specific speaker myself or a

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 friend I'm about to bring up.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I mean from God's word on the clues of how to conquer and work

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 through and get out of some of the toxic anxious thinking and

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 feelings that mark our lives.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 The good news is the Bible says that there is a way.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And it doesn't come from self-help or positive thinking.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It comes from the truth contained in God's word.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And what I want to do in a few minutes is walk through a

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 crucial topic with a gifted friend and minister who has

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 devoted the last 18 months or long amount of time studying

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 what it looks like and how all the ways that our toxic thinking

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 God's word really does give us the clues to help break out and

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 experience freedom from some of the anxiety.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 My guess is if you came in the room and I said, hey, if you hit

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 this, most people would hit it.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And it may not be that simple but it is clear in God's word,

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 he gives us paths that we can choose to get on and choose to

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 battle against anxious fearful thinking.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So I'm going to bring up a friend, her name is Jenny Allen.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And Jenny, as she gets up here, let me tell you about Jenny.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 If you are not familiar with Jenny, she leads an organization

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 that helps hundreds of thousands of women around the country.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 She's a New York Times best-selling author and a mom of

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 four and a tremendously gifted minister and a gift to our body.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And a member of Watermark.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And every now and then you run into people, man, the spirit of

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 God is at work through them.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And Jenny is someone that every time I'm around her, I sense

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 that and see that and constantly encouraged.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head and I asked her,

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 what is it that you can do to help us talk through.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Because you put into word form practically how God's word helps

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 us and why it's so important that we get out of our head.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Welcome to the stage, Jenny Allen.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 [Applause]

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Thank you, David.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Come on.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Great to be here, guys.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 How you doing?

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So Jenny wrote a book, man, I left it down there.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Get Out of Your Head.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Jenny has written a number of books and been a part of

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Watermark.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And I mean everything that I said, Jenny, such a gift to the

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 church and generation.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 If you don't know about if gathering and you're a girl,

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 for girls, you need to know about if gathering.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Check that out, I think in March or at some point.

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I read through this two different times and so encouraged

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 by it.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Because this generation in particular, everybody right now

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 is stuck in our head, feeling anxious.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 There's uncertainty.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And no, I don't think uncertainty is increased.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Because we all live in 100% uncertainty every single day.

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Like everything is uncertain.

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Whether, you know, we realized it or not, COVID has made things

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 feel and the climate has made it feel uncertain.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So just wanted to launch into this conversation and talk up

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 to you, what made you decide to write this book and open into

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 the conversation of anxiety.

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And why is -- in the book you call it the battle, the most

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 important battle of this generation is taking place in

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 the mind.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Most people don't realize it.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But it is shaping your future, it's shaping your life.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's shaping who you're going to marry, who you're becoming.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's shaping all of your life right now.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So just why is that so important?

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Why would you say that?

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And what made you passionate about it?

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah, well, you know, this is the thing.

176
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 This is so random.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I'm going to start with a really interesting funny story.

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So one of my friends sent me an article in Cosmo where they

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 talked about my book.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Which is really interesting because it's very Jesus.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 In fact I have a whole portion about it not being self-help.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It's interesting that Cosmo shared my book.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And what they said is, it's like Jenny Allen knew that you know

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 what was going to hit the fan.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 This Christian book is in Cosmo with a cuss word about it.

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And I think the funny thing is, I didn't.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But God did.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Like God knew that this book would come out two months before

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 COVID hit.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And I can't explain that.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 There's no way I could ever, you know, make this happen in life.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 You just know that there is a God that cares about people.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Because this topic, it wasn't even the book I was supposed to

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 write.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I shifted gears two years before and went to work and put my head

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 down on this book.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And put another book that I was almost done with to the side.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And so God knew the timing was going to matter.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And I start with that story because the timing matters.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And what he just said is exactly right.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 What happened is the lake drained.

202
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And we all saw it was at the bottom of our lakes.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And what was at the bottom of our lakes was a lot of mess.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And so I think it's not new stuff.

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I think it was already there.

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 But I do think that what we found was, wow, I have been

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 anxious probably for a long time.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I may have been busy enough that I didn't notice.

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Or I have been depressed for a long time.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And we're starting to even consider maybe I need to get

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 some help.

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I think that's what is powerful about COVID.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 What you said was so right, David.

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I don't think we found ourselves in a unique moment that has

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 produced a lot of anxiety.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I think we found ourselves in a moment that revealed the anxiety

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 we already felt.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Why did you write it?

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 I know you have a lot of things on your mind.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 What shifted or led you down that journey?

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I know you talk about doubt and that wrestle.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And I think that's part of the reason.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 How would you say?

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Two things.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 One, my daughter Kate is 18 years old.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 She's a freshman at A&M.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And for five years -- yeah.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 For five years, I'm a razor bat.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 [Laughter]

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Just throw that in there.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I'm a razor bat.

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's hard, y'all.

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I got two Aggies.

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 What did I do?

235
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 God's people, man.

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Anyway.

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So my daughter is in seventh grade and she gets this passion

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and heart for neuroscience.

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And she starts reading and watching Ted Talks on it.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And so I start doing this with her.

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And it's so interesting.

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Because when I started doing the science work on this book, I

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 thought it was going to be in opposition to the Bible.

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But it actually completely revealed what the Bible says is

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 true.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 That our brains can change.

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 That our brains physically are changing based on what we think

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 about.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So our chemistry, our body is very connected to the brain that

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 God built.

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That's not surprising to Christians.

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Right?

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Christians know that God built all of this to work together and

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 for others good and for his glory.

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And so when something is broken in our mind, it begins to affect

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 every part of us.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And I think that's where I started to get so passionate.

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I minister to women and I talk about emotions.

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 My first Bible study was stuck and walks through the emotions

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 we face.

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 But I didn't see our side of the church really talking about the

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 mind.

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And about how we could shift it.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And yet everything I was reading in science and psychiatry and

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 all of these things were absolutely echoing what the

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Bible says.

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 They just completely fell short.

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And I was like, I don't know how to introduce this.

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 They would end the book.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 It would be biblical in the sense that you can change your

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 brain and your brain can change.

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And towards the end it would say, so what you need to do is

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 think positive thoughts about yourself.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That you are awesome.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And all of these positive self-esteem things.

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And I was thinking, well, I just am not.

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So I don't exactly know like how that's supposed to help.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 If I don't feel awesome about myself.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Am I just supposed to tell myself that I'm worth something?

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And so I think watching my daughter for five years, five

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 years she was pursuing this.

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I saw and read a lot and I realized the church is afraid of

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 this topic and yet it is absolutely biblical.

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 So that was the first thing.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 The second thing that happened was I went through a season of

286
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 doubt for 18 months.

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Following a crazy story that it was just dark.

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And so I entered into this season of just wrestling with my

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 faith.

290
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And for 18 months I woke up in the middle of the night and

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 asked myself, is this true?

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Does it fade to black?

293
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Why are you wasting your life on this if it's not?

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And that sounds very alarming.

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But somehow, you know, in my experience the devil never likes

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 to be noticed.

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He wants to do things in a very subtle way.

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And so looking at that over time, I don't think I let

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 anybody in or I talked about it.

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But it wasn't because I was embarrassed or hiding it.

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 It was that I didn't think it was a big deal.

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And yet 18 months later I feel my faith eroding.

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I would be speaking on stages about Jesus and in the back of

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 my head I would be questioning, am I selling a myth?

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Y'all, let me just tell you, you don't know my faith.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 You don't know my story.

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 But I have gotten to be someone who has walked on waves and

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 seen God do complete miracles.

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 The fact that I was questioning my faith did not equal the life

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I was leading at all.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And I don't tell anybody and 18 months later I do finally open

312
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 my mouth and say this has gotten pretty bad.

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Now the irony is the reason I finally told people was I

314
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 watched the second to last Avengers movie.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Yeah.

316
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And it's the one, I'm sorry if y'all don't know this but you

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 are really late and I'm not going to protect you from the

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 spoiler.

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 The second to last one, y'all know what happens.

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Some of the superheroes and half the earth evaporates into dust.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 That's the worst.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Yeah, it's a bummer.

323
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And then they leave you there.

324
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So I see that movie, you guys, and I go home and I can't

325
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 breathe.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And for two to three days I'm having panic.

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Because that's what I'm afraid of.

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I'm just afraid it goes to dust.

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And that none of it mattered.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And I'm like, I'm not going to watch that movie again.

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And finally I start talking and realizing this is really

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 affecting me.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 My fear of death.

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I can't even watch a Marvel movie without having panic

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 attacks.

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And so I mention it to a friend and what happens when I bring

337
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 somebody into it.

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Two things.

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 First thing that happens is I said it out loud and as I heard

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 myself say, I don't know if I even believe in God anymore.

341
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That's how dramatic it was.

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I love wrestling with stuff like that.

343
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It was dramatic when I said it.

344
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And as the words came out of my mouth, I started laughing.

345
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And I was like, that's not true.

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I believe in God.

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Like I literally heard myself say what I had been saying in my

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 head for 18 months.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I said it.

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And I was so aware that it was not true.

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And my sweet friend that heard it, she watches me live and

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 she's like, Ginny, that's not true.

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I watched you live the last two years.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 You love and trust God.

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And then the second thing I said, I think I have been under

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 spiritual attack.

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Yeah.

358
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I mean it was obvious and I totally missed it.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And so after that, to answer your question, I got angry.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Like this wasn't any longer just this situation of you know what?

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 We all think negative thoughts.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Let's be authentic about it.

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 What are you thinking negatively and what is your anxiety.

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Let's talk about it.

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It turned to war.

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I was like no, no, no.

367
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 This is the enemy and he got me alone in the dark and told me

368
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 whatever he wanted.

369
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And I am not going to let that happen to half the church.

370
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Or you know there is a bunch of guys here, I will bring you into

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 it too.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I am not going to let that happen.

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Because if we are in a place where the enemy can tell us --

374
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I grew up in a church where they said don't talk about the devil

375
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 too much.

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And I read Ephesians and dark cosmic forces are coming for us.

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And I thought let's talk about it a little.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And on this subject, I think we need to bring that in.

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And I will tell you why in a minute.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Because there is scripture that brings it in clearly.

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That we are not fighting flesh.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 That we are fighting spirit.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And we have to recognize that there is a war for our minds.

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000

 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

583
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

585
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

586
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

587
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

588
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

589
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

590
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

591
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

592
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

593
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

594
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

595
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

596
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

597
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

598
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

599
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

600
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

601
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I am reading this verse again...

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Do we believe that?

603
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Like if we don't believe that church, we don't have anything

604
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 else to stand on.

605
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Like the medicine, it doesn't matter.

606
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 The other stuff is only going to be a fix for a little while.

607
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 The practical ways that we can be grateful instead of negative.

608
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 All of that, those practices are powerful.

609
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And God taught us about these practices that help us be

610
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 grateful.

611
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And help us train our minds and discipline our minds.

612
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 The scripture is full of that and we will talk about some of

613
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 those.

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But if we don't understand first and foremost that we are at war

615
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and there is an enemy and he wants to kill, steal and destroy

616
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 you.

617
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And you have power and authority and divine weapons that destroy

618
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 strongholds.

619
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And I am like, that's where -- let's wake up to that first so

620
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 that we quit playing defense.

621
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And honestly we are not even playing defense.

622
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 And like he's just beating us up.

623
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Like that's what I did for 18 months.

624
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 He just beat me up for 18 months and I let him.

625
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And that's where I am going, okay, let's change our posture.

626
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Let's start with this.

627
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That one, do you realize that the spirit of God is available

628
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 to you.

629
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And that he wants to work with you and fight the enemy with

630
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 you.

631
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And that there are people that want to help you fight the

632
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 enemy.

633
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And that there is a word that teaches us how to fight the

634
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 enemy.

635
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But it's all going somewhere.

636
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And it's not like I am going to get fixed today.

637
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 That's what I am going to do.

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 That's how we read scripture, we want it to fix us.

639
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Rather than we are at war.

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And everything you think and everything you feel and every

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 behavior you have and every relationship you have, it's

642
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 playing into that war.

643
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And so the cost if we don't fight back, if we just let the

644
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 enemy stick us in a corner with anxiety and make us obsess about

645
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 ourselves and our problems.

646
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Instead of the power of God in me and through me and what can

647
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 happen.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 That is terrifying and it shuts us down.

649
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And so what I love about scripture is it starts with this

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 big story and narrative.

651
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Hey, let's start with Hebrews 12, part of the narrative.

652
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Run the race that is set before you, fixing your eyes on Jesus

653
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 and throwing off the burden and weight that is set before you.

654
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And I think as we are going, as we realize, okay, all of this is

655
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 supposed to fit into this bigger story where there is a plan and

656
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 it is to take me out.

657
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 There is a plan and it is to take you out.

658
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So we have got to start with -- and let me tell you why this

659
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 matters.

660
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Because then you hate it.

661
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Then you are like motivated.

662
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 It's not just about your happiness.

663
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 It's not just about your freedom.

664
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 It's not just about the way you have a greater impact on the

665
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 kingdom.

666
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 It is about eternity.

667
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And if you realize that that anxiety -- I don't mean to put

668
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 too much weight on it but I think we haven't put enough, right.

669
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I can see y'all, are y'all with me?

670
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Okay.

671
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 So I think we put too much of just this passing idea that we

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 are just victims and how we feel and how we -- you know, what

673
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 we are thinking about.

674
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 All of these things, this is my lot.

675
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I struggle with anxiety.

676
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And I am like, all right, how are we going to fight that?

677
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Let's start fighting that.

678
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And let's not take that for granted and struggle with this

679
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 for the next 50, 60 years we have on earth.

680
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And if we change our posture, yes, there are things we can

681
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 do that help in that fight that scripture is clear about.

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 But I think what I hope you hear from this and what I hope you

683
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 take away is that you have a lot more power than you think.

684
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And I think what I hope you take away is that so many people that

685
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 have processed this and read the book and gone through months

686
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 after that and what it looks like for them is that you will

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 start to sense that you are anxious like I did today and

688
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 you will say, you know what, I don't want to stay there and I

689
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 don't want my brain to stay there for more than a day.

690
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 So I am going to go -- I am going to make a priority for my

691
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 mind today and sit down with somebody that loves me and sit

692
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 down with somebody that loves me and I will be able to do that

693
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000

 >> 2,000 years before Freud or any of you came along, welcome to where we have been for 2,000 years.

1001
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And so that's why this is such a crucial and important topic.

1002
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 And anything you would add on that?

1003
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 >> Oh, that's good.

1004
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Yeah, I just -- I feel like --

1005
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 >> I thought so.

1006
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 It was well delivered.

1007
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 >> Well done.

1008
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Yeah.

1009
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 I mean, here's the thing.

1010
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 We're all trying so hard to work on our behavior.

1011
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 And this is why if you have never done the work in your life.

1012
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 If you have been abused in any form.

1013
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Any form.

1014
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 If you have -- you know, for all of us.

1015
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I bet most of us can remember a time when everything changed.

1016
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 You may not have been physically abused.

1017
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 But you can remember when you picked up one of those lies.

1018
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 I was 12 years old.

1019
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 I'm sitting in my dad's recliner with him.

1020
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 And I felt so safe.

1021
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 Safe enough to sit like really close to my dad.

1022
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 And just sit there and talk to him.

1023
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 And we were looking at the ceiling.

1024
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 I remember it had popcorn.

1025
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 We were in my childhood home.

1026
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 And I remember he started asking me questions like this.

1027
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 12 years old.

1028
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Do you think you're going to make homecoming court this year?

1029
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Do you think, you know, so-and-so likes you?

1030
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 How are your grades?

1031
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 He was running through a list of things that I could tell.

1032
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 He thought if you maximize those things, then you're going to be a good daughter.

1033
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Then you're going to be a good human.

1034
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 And as a little girl, it's the first time I remember feeling like I am not safe.

1035
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And I am not enough as I am.

1036
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 And that began a journey for me that I struggled with until 30 years old.

1037
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Where I felt like I could not hit an invisible line that kept moving.

1038
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And I was chasing it with all my guts.

1039
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And I loved God.

1040
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And I was a competing idol of approval.

1041
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 That ran right beside my love for God.

1042
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And that verse in Hebrews 12, that it hindered me.

1043
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 And was it my fault that I picked that up?

1044
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 No.

1045
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 But was it my fault that I didn't fight it?

1046
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Yes.

1047
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 So there's probably a moment that you can remember when that lie entered in.

1048
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 And so we've got to do this work.

1049
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 I know some of you guys are like, oh, my gosh.

1050
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 I'm going to have some deep talk with my girlfriend tonight.

1051
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 I feel it.

1052
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 But I promise you it is worth going back and figuring out what did you pick up?

1053
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 And where did you pick it up?

1054
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Because if it is from the enemy, which all lies are from him.

1055
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 John tells us Jesus was really clear, he's the father of lies and it's his native tongue.

1056
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 It's how he speaks.

1057
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 So if we just let those lies grow in us, we don't want to live with that anymore.

1058
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Yeah, that's good.

1059
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 And I think that's a really important thing.

1060

1270
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Yeah.

1271
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 So you have been married to Zach?

1272
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 23 years.

1273
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 23 years.

1274
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Razorback?

1275
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 No, we met at Canica camps.

1276
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 Nothing like a good camp love story.

1277
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 We were kissing in the K-Dome.

1278
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 Wow, that definitely violates camp policy.

1279
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 It did.

1280
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 Sorry, Joe.

1281
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 It ended up working out.

1282
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 And you guys have four kids.

1283
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 What would you say to most of the room by far is single.

1284
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 And in terms of qualities that drew you to Zach.

1285
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 No marriage is perfect.

1286
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 I know you guys have been shared here before.

1287
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 We're all on a journey.

1288
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 But what were the qualities that drew you to Zach other than he

1289
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 was a good French kisser in the K-Dome.

1290
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 He was.

1291
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 That was a joke.

1292
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 He is.

1293
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Okay.

1294
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 Save the e-mail.

1295
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 What qualities would you say, man, these are the things to look for.

1296
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 Because you have a daughter.

1297
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 And you have young adult kids who you would say, these are the qualities to look for in a husband.

1298
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Absolutely.

1299
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 This is a little bit secret story I don't think I have ever told.

1300
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 Right before we got married, this is probably two months.

1301
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 So we didn't do save the date back then.

1302
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 That's a new expensive feature of weddings.

1303
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 So that hadn't gone out.

1304
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 But it was probably about the time that would have gone out.

1305
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 And I was having doubts that I should marry him.

1306
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 And I remember we were long-distance dating.

1307
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 And I was like, I don't know.

1308
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 And I remember we were long-distance dating.

1309
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 And so I barely knew the guy.

1310
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 We just -- it was scary that we were getting married.

1311
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 Except that the guy was godly.

1312
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 And I remember one day we were together.

1313
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 And I was like, Lord, I can't go into marriage wondering if I should be married to this guy.

1314
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 You have to seal the deal here.

1315
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 And I prayed.

1316
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 I remember that day going to war with it and saying, God, you have to be clear with me if this is the man I am supposed to marry.

1317
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 And of course a voice from the sky -- I am just kidding.

1318
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 That didn't happen.

1319
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 But what did happen is I opened my Bible and I began to go, okay, what do we know about marriage?

1320
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 What do we know about the kind of guy I should marry?

1321
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 And I just began to write a list in my little journal.

1322
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 And I was like, he needs to be humble.

1323
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 He needs to pray.

1324
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 He needs to be committed and surrender to Jesus and do whatever he says.

1325
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 Check.

1326
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 He needs to honor me.

1327
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 He needs to believe that I have, you know, gifts and that he's going to partner with me in those.

1328
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 Check.

1329
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 And I was like, okay, I am going to do that.

1330
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 Because it was super simple things.

1331
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 And at the end of that, I looked at the list and I was like, is this who he is?

1332
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
 And the answer was absolutely yes.

1333
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
 I mean, he's not perfect in any of those things.

1334
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 In fact, we went on to have difficult first five years of marriage and did get some counseling, a lot of counseling after that.

1335
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
 But he was a godly man.

1336
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 And he loved him and he was going to follow him and I knew it.

1337
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 And so I committed to marry the man.

1338
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 And I'm saying this because I think we think there's some special feeling that will come over us at some point that's like, light, shine from heaven, anoint the girl, this is her.

1339
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
 And I'm having these conversations with my kids.

1340
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 I was like, it doesn't work like that.

1341
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 Look around and see who's following God.

1342
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 I don't know if you're attracted.

1343
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 Yes, maybe that's a part of it.

1344
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 But no, that's not really a biblical part of it.

1345
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 Marrying a girl that loves God and is spending her life doing that.

1346
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Because the purpose of marriage is that we display the relationship between Jesus and the church.

1347
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 And if it is not sacrificial, if it is not committed no matter what to biblical story lines that he's given us, then I don't see -- it's just what the TV teaches us.

1348
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 It's just what, you know, it's just what culture teaches us.

1349
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 That's not love.

1350
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 What love is, is two people committed to God and committing to each other for all their life.

1351
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 And it won't feel -- because here's the thing.

1352
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 If you get the attraction, good.

1353
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
 But it will go away.

1354
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 So it's like why chase something that's fickle.

1355
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 If you get a guy, and I did, and I was attracted to him at different times.

1356
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 But I did -- he's going to kill me.

1357
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 He's watching live.

1358
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
 I love you, baby.

1359
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 I'm so attracted to you now.

1360
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 Oh, my gosh, I'm in so much trouble.

1361
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 But it wasn't -- what did you say?

1362
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 Nothing.

1363
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
 I'm not going to repeat it.

1364
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 But it wasn't about the attraction.

1365
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 It was that I just felt confused and I didn't feel sure.

1366
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 And what made me sure was not feelings that seemed to come and go.

1367
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 It was the character of God that I saw in his life.

1368
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 And I think that is what has seen us through 23 years.

1369
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 And I look at him now, y'all, and I am totally attracted to him, baby.

1370
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
 I am so attracted to you.

1371
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 I cannot wait to get home tonight.

1372
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 But -- but -- but it isn't about that even today.

1373
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 Because if that goes away tomorrow, I don't care.

1374
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 Like I'm in this with this man to be for the good of people and the glory of God.

1375
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 So it's just a different way to view marriage.

1376
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 And we are such teammates and we have fun and we are running the race.

1377
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 But it was built on a vision of obeying God together, not on feelings.

1378
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 So good.

1379
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 Okay, last question, just as we wrap up.

1380
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 Your ministry has given you a platform.

1381
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 You speak to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people a year.

1382
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
 A lot of them are young adults.

1383
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 You have young adult kids.

1384
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 Anything you would say to encourage, sharpen, challenge,

1385
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
 just if you had a few minutes to just share anything with this group and those listening.

1386
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 I would say this.

1387
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 That go build a life that is building heaven.

1388
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
 And leave the details out of that.

1389
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 If you can look around at your life.

1390
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 And I'm not talking about vocational ministry, for goodness sakes.

1391
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 I'm largely ministering.

1392
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 We largely minister to Christians.

1393
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 You know, you guys are the ones in the trenches.

1394
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
 What we're supposed to do is equip the saints for the work of the kingdom.

1395
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 I'm just talking about in everything you're doing, like spending it in this eternal story we've been talking about tonight.

1396
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 And the reason I say that is, guys, I don't know how much longer we have before Jesus is going to come back.

1397
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 And my sense is I'm spending a lot of time actually with Gen Z right now.

1398
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
 That's a lot of who we minister to is college students.

1399
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 I'm looking at Gen Z and some of you are in that category.

1400
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
 And I'm going, we may be preparing them to usher in the kingdom.

1401
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 There's that sense in me of just, I want you to be Daniels in Babylon.

1402
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 And I want you to know God and to be disciplined and to care about -- I mean, when that becomes the storyline,

1403
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 when you're like, you know what, Jesus could come back soon.

1404
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 I work with Bible translation too.

1405
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 I'm a big translator for a people group in a jungle.

1406
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 I'm just kidding.

1407
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 I just give them money.

1408
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 But I do think that in 13 years they're saying that we're going to have reached every single language.

1409
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 13 years, which is one of the things that has to happen before Jesus can come back.

1410
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 So the fact that we're closing in on almost everything that we would need for revelation to happen,

1411
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 for Jesus to come back, means that we should be taking our lives very seriously.

1412
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 And so the addiction, the distraction, the anxiety that I see in the church,

1413
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 I want to fight it not so that you can live happier lives, so that we can usher in the kingdom of God together.

1414
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 Because we might just be up.

1415
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 Like it might be the calling of our lives.

1416
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
 So take it all seriously.

1417
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 Take it all seriously.

1418
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Because we don't want to be those that are sleeping when he comes back.

1419
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 We want to be those that are running and we're out of breath and we're not surprised.

1420
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 We're like, hallelujah, I don't even have to die.

1421
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 Like I get to just fly up to heaven.

1422
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 You know?

1423
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 Let's be that.

1424
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
 And I think if we could take it that seriously, you know, I just -- gosh, the world needs hope right now.

1425
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 And we could be that hope for them.

1426
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 >> So good.

1427
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Would you mind -- yeah.

1428
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
 Would you mind praying that that would be the case and praying in particular for anyone who is trapped,

1429
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 whether they would say that or not, just in the spiral of fear or anxiety or lust or anger or just sad.

1430
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 >> Yeah.

1431
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 I'm going to pray on my knees.

1432
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 Because we are fighting spiritual forces.

1433
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 Because the greatest desire of the enemy would to cause every single human that hears my voice right now to be stuck

1434
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
 and helpless and hopeless and distracted and addicted, checked out.

1435
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 And, God, that is against your will for us.

1436
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 And I believe things are at stake that we can't imagine, and yet you imagine them and you know them.

1437
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 And so I pray for your spirit to set us free, God, and not in some magical way,

1438
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 but in participation, choices that we make every day to pursue you instead of pursue the world.

1439
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 To pursue you instead of pursue our flesh and what it craves and what it wants.

1440
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 God, I pray for a holy people set apart and blameless, God, not perfect, but covered with the blood and living like it.

1441
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 Believing it, God, not just saying, yeah, I'm a Christian, but believing that that changes everything and letting it.

1442
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
 God, I pray against half-heartedness.

1443
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 I pray, God, that our whole hearts would be surrendered to you.

1444
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
 And at any place that they're not, God, would you root it out, would you show us, would you help us name it.

1445
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 The place that we've loved something more than you, that we've let the enemy lie to us,

1446
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 that we've completely submitted to darkness in a way that is not pleasing to you.

1447
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 God, show us, make it so clear where we can't shake it and help us confess it.

1448
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 Help us surrender it.

1449
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 God, I pray for every person hearing my voice, God, would they not be apathetic?

1450
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 Would they walk out of here, would they grab people by the shoulder and say, how can I fight for you?

1451
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 How can I pray for you?

1452
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 How can I help you love Jesus more?

1453
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 Would we be those kind of people for each other?

1454
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Would we believe that you are more powerful than the enemy that is seeking to kill, steal, and destroy us?

1455
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 And would we act like it?

1456
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 And would we go to your word constantly?

1457
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
 God, not even daily, but hour by hour, would we be going to it constantly?

1458
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 Because it is the only hope that we have.

1459
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 Without it, God, we are hopeless, we are helpless, we are worthless, we are unlovable.

1460
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 But because of you, we are the most loved people on planet Earth.

1461
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 So help, God, that love go and reach out to the ends of the Earth.

1462
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
 God, I just, I picture everybody in here, and I'm picturing this generation, and I'm picturing us in heaven.

1463
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
 And I just, I want so badly, more than anything else on Earth,

1464
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 I want so badly for us to get up there and like high-five and be like, "We left it on the field."

1465
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 Like, "We did everything we could to build the kingdom of God while we were here."

1466
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 And so anything prohibiting that in me, in us,

1467
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 God, take it out and help us be faithful to choose you day after day.

1468
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1469
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 - Amen. - Thanks, guys.

1470
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 - Thank you, Jenny.

1471
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 Can you guys give it up for Jenny Allen? Thank you, Jenny.

1472
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,000
 I'm just going to wrap this up, and we're going to close in song.

1473
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
 I think some of us in the room, we're in that escape room.

1474
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 And you're in that place, and you feel stuck.

1475
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 And I want you to know it's because you are.

1476
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
 And it may be stuck in depression.

1477
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 It may be stuck in anxiety.

1478
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
 It may be stuck in a pornography addiction.

1479
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 It may be stuck in a really toxic relationship.

1480
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
 It may be stuck in that there's so much trauma from sexual abuse you've never told anybody about.

1481
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 It wasn't your fault, but you've never dealt with that.

1482
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 And now it begins to bleed out into your life.

1483
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
 You don't trust people because of what your dad did.

1484
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,000
 And you're stuck, and you're in those walls, not physically, but inside of your mind and inside of your life.

1485
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 And it's impacting the rest of your future and your current reality.

1486
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 And you're going to be there, and you're going to be stuck until you do what we had to do in that escape room,

1487
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 where you're willing to say, "Hey, I don't care. I need help. I need help. I need a clue.

1488
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
 I need something from the outside to help me get unstuck."

1489
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 And you go to God's Word and God's people, and you know what you're going to find?

1490
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 You're going to find steps towards freedom.

1491
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
 And you don't have to stay stuck, but let me be abundantly clear, you're going to,

1492
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
 until you're willing to do what the Bible says is called "surrender."

1493
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
 I can't do it all on my own. I can't fight this on my own.

1494
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
 You weren't made to fight it on your own.

1495
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 You were made to go to God's people, to God's Word, and to say, "I need help."

1496
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 And tonight is a chance for you to do that.

1497
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 And if you take those steps, your life and your future is going to change.

1498
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 And if you don't, let me be clear, if you're 30, 10 years from now, you're going to be the same.

1499
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
 That thing you're hiding, eating disorder, past abortion, shame and guilt you carry,

1500
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
 they're not going away.

1501
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 If anything, they may just grow and grow until you're willing to say, "I need help."

1502
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 And what you'll find is God, His Word, His people, will come rushing in.

1503
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 And tonight I wanted you to hear, there are steps that you can take.

1504
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:11,000
 But you've got to be willing to say, "Man, I want to be free. I need help."

1505
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
 Others of you, you're in a place where you need to know that you,

1506
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 the greatest thing you need to surrender is the fact that you think that you could earn a relationship with God.

1507
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
 You've never put your faith in Jesus. In fact, you don't even know what the Bible teaches.

1508
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 You think the Bible teaches good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.

1509
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 I just need to be a good person. This place has pretty cool vibes.

1510
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 And you know, they don't make me wear a suit in church. That's kind of cool.

1511
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 So I'm coming in here, and you think that God is angry at you, can't forgive you.

1512
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
 You need to read your Bible and attend church, and then He'll love you more.

1513
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 Then you could have a relationship with Him.

1514
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
 And you have bought a lie. The Bible doesn't teach that.

1515
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
 It teaches not good people in heaven, bad people in hell.

1516
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 Forgiven people go to heaven.

1517
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 And the only way you get forgiveness is by putting your trust not in what you have done,

1518
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
 or what you did, to be the thing that keeps you in relationship with God,

1519
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 or keeps you out of heaven with God.

1520
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 That's never been what Christianity teaches.

1521
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
 It teaches, you know who gets to have a relationship with God?

1522
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
 You know whose life begins to change?

1523
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
 You know who spends eternity in heaven?

1524
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
 People who go, "I'm not enough. I surrender.

1525
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 If I'm ever going to have a relationship with God, it's only because of Jesus.

1526
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 I think I'm a good person, try to be nice, pay my taxes."

1527
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 Not enough.

1528
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 The Bible has never taught those things matter.

1529
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
 It's never taught those things change how God feels about you.

1530
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 It teaches people who say, "I'm a sinner.

1531
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 My life is full of messed up decisions I made.

1532
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 I have hurt people. I've done things I'm ashamed of."

1533
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 But because Jesus on that cross gave his life for me,

1534
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 paid for my decisions, my sin,

1535
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 all of those have been forgiven.

1536
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 God doesn't hold them against me.

1537
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 Any sin in my future, already forgiven.

1538
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 Because on that cross, the Son of God came to this earth,

1539
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
 was crucified, was buried, and he rose again.

1540
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
 And you know what that shows?

1541
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 He paid for all sin ever.

1542
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 He conquered all sin. He even conquered death.

1543
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 When he rose from the grave, it's like the check cleared.

1544
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 The credit card went through.

1545
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 It was more than enough.

1546
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 People who accept Jesus paid for their sin.

1547
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
 Those are people who spend eternity with God.

1548
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 Those are people whose life changed.

1549
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
 But you know what it takes in order to do that? It's a really hard thing.

1550
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 You've got to say, "I need help.

1551
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 I can't do it on my own.

1552
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 I can't do it on my own."

1553
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 And you know what? You can't.

1554
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
 And he's done everything that he can to say, "You can't.

1555
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
 That's why I gave my life for you."

1556
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 If you'll trust in that,

1557
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
 your eternity will change,

1558
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 and your present reality will begin to change.

1559
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
 Let me pray.

1560
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 Father, thank you that you are more powerful

1561
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
 than any thought,

1562
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 any thought pattern,

1563
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
 any cosmic forces of darkness,

1564
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 any enemy in this world.

1565
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
 You're more powerful than any evil that could take place in the hearts of people.

1566
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 You're more powerful than sickness, than sin, than death.

1567
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
 You are victorious,

1568
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 and nothing can stand against you.

1569
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
 And you have allowed us, through your Spirit,

1570
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
 the weapons to wage war in the mind.

1571
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
 So I pray tonight that those who are battling anxiety,

1572
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 they would experience freedom.

1573
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 Not just in a moment, but in a day by day, moment by moment,

1574
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
 second by second, thought by thought, war.

1575
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
 By holding on to what is true, what's noble, what's pure, what's lovely, what's right,

1576
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 you begin to create pathways and change the way that they think,

1577
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 and therefore change the way that they live,

1578
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 and you would set people free.

1579
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
 I pray for those who've never put their faith in Jesus.

1580
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 Tonight, they would realize they're a sinner.

1581
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
 They've done things that you, according to your Word,

1582
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
 you say, "Man, the wages of sin or the repayment for sin,

1583
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
 the consequences is separation from God."

1584
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
 Unless you're willing to say, "I need help,

1585
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
 and I accept what you did for me,"

1586
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 that they would receive the payment your Son gave,

1587
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
 the Savior of the world, the King of kings,

1588
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 and they would find rest in your hands, in your plan, in your love.

1589
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 Father, we need your help, all of us.

1590
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 We've got 60,000 thoughts a day, many of which, maybe most of which,

1591
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
 are not in a direction that's leading us to the life that we want.

1592
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 They're not captive to your Spirit, so we ask and invite,

1593
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 just plead that you would help us, God.

1594
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 Thank you that you provided your Word and your people.

1595
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 Help us to go to war.

1596
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 We love you, in Christ's name, amen.
