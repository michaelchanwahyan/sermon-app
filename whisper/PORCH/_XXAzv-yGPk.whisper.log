[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.260]   - All right, what's up guys?
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.720]   Welcome everybody that is tuning in online
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.080]   or wherever you are joining us from,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.920]   and we are excited to continue this series, Therapy.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.560]   We kicked it off last week
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.200]   and we began to explore a crucial topic,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.400]   especially right now, and that's mental health.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.720]   And how the church and really the Bible
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.260]   speaks to these issues,
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.560]   because it does over and over and over.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.160]   This is an issue that we had planned before, you know,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.360]   COVID and Corona had even happened,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.900]   doing a series called Therapy,
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.760]   addressing mental health,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.140]   specifically these first few weeks
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.600]   we're camping out on anxiety
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.680]   'cause it's too big of an issue to hit in one night.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.360]   But furthermore, we had planned this
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.380]   even before COVID happened.
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.220]   And then it was like,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.240]   if our nation ever needed to go through therapy,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.420]   it is now, this is a time where we all need to do some work.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.520]   And specifically as it relates to anxiety and depression
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.480]   and having mental health.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   God cares about you.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.760]   He wants you to experience that.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.440]   And so we're gonna look for the next few weeks at his word.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   There was a study that was done,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.360]   I referenced last week of just how important this is
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.960]   is anxiety is not going away.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.400]   If anything, it's getting worse.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.080]   And it referenced that the average psychiatric patient
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.840]   in 1950 had the same levels of anxiety
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260]   as a young person today.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.100]   Think about that.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.320]   And yet for Christians,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.080]   God over and over talks about this subject
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.500]   where he says, I want you to experience a life
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.160]   that is not ruled and owned by fear or anxiety.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.140]   We start by telling a kind of funny thing
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.240]   that's relevant to our team.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   I know y'all have all heard it, but the term dog mom.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.280]   I don't know how long, how long has dog mom been around?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   Like a while?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.920]   Maybe years.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.680]   It feels like this thing just came onto the scene
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.020]   and people went from like, oh, I just really love dogs
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.680]   to no, this is my fur baby.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.320]   I see them not as my pet, but as my child.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.240]   There's this phenomenon of dog moms.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.600]   How do you know if somebody is a dog mom
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.440]   or what does this look like?
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.640]   It looks like what it sounds like.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   It's somebody who sees their pet as like, this is my baby.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.980]   They set up other play dates with other dog moms
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800]   for them and their fur babies to go play together.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.320]   They're thinking about Christmas presents for their dog.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.180]   They're thinking about Halloween costumes,
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.620]   months in advance, gourmet food.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.080]   They go to the nines 'cause they see this dog,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.280]   not as a dog, but as their own pet.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.080]   The most extreme example of this in my life,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.300]   I've joked about before,
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.720]   is a girl that was on our team named Emily.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.880]   Emily was extra as it related to her dog.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400]   She had picked out her Halloween costume
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.360]   for her dog months in advance.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.720]   Every time she went to Target, she said, and I quote,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.220]   "It's like a chance for me to go get a little toy
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.720]   "for my little baby."
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   If that wasn't enough, she gave her dog,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.500]   she's got two middle names.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.960]   In other words, yeah, I said last week
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.440]   that counseling should not be the first line of defense
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   for anybody, but if you're giving your dogs middle names,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.840]   it may be something you consider.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.160]   But she gives her dogs like double names.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.060]   Like if you're from the South,
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.840]   you probably have heard of people that go by two names.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360]   They're like, "Hey, my name's Mary Claire,"
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   or "I'm Sarah Beth," and you're like, "Oh, hey, Sarah."
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.560]   And they're like, "Actually, it's Sarah Beth."
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480]   This is what Emily does with her dogs.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.920]   So if you're around her dog, Cooper James,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.120]   can't even believe that I'm acknowledging that,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.320]   and you're like, "Oh, hey, Cooper,"
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.040]   she's like, "It's actually Cooper James."
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.240]   She's just so extreme.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.040]   She's the most extreme version of a dog mom I've ever seen.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.280]   She loves her dogs incredibly.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   Now with that in mind, let me ask you
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.400]   kind of a funny question.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Do you think that she loves her dogs
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.480]   more than God loves you?
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   Do you think she thinks about her dogs?
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.920]   Like that's pretty extreme.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.120]   If you're thinking about, "I'm going to Target.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.880]   "I can't wait to go get him a toy."
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.440]   You're thinking about that dog.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.800]   Do you think she thinks about her dogs
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.480]   more than God thinks about you?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.520]   She really values them.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.720]   Like she's like, "Hey, you can burn the house down.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.160]   "Do not take the dogs."
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.800]   Do you think that she values, truly?
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   Do you think she values her dogs more than God
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.760]   values you and your life?
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.560]   I think most of us would say, "No, no, no, no, it's crazy."
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.960]   But functionally, a lot of us live that way.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.840]   We don't walk around with the mentality of like,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.120]   "Hey, God loves me.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.280]   "He's in control of everything.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120]   "He's for me.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   "He's going to provide for me.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.160]   "I'm good."
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.800]   Most of us walk around like,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.840]   "Hey, and if I don't do enough, it's not going to happen.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.520]   "And I'm so concerned and my life's going to fall apart.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.040]   "What if I lose my job?"
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.400]   And we don't have the mentality of like,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.600]   "Man, I have a providing father who loves me."
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   What's funny is when Jesus started his sermon on the Mount,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.640]   he started with a question that's almost as abrupt
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   as what I just asked you.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.840]   If like, "Hey, do you think that she loves her dogs
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.680]   "more than God loves you?"
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.720]   He asked a strikingly similar question.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   That's why I asked this one to his audience.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.200]   Now to recap, last week we opened up
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.400]   and we covered first couple of verses
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.760]   of what Jesus taught on anxiety.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.320]   Sermon on the Mount, Jesus's most famous sermon,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.680]   taught it from a mountainside.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.320]   It's covered a lot of topics.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.720]   One of them was anxiety.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   People have been anxious for a long time.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.840]   And in the middle of his conversation about anxiety,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.040]   he asks a question related to the value of an animal
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.720]   and God and his value of you.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.560]   Here's what he says.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.680]   This comes from Matthew chapter six, starting in verse 24.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   After saying, "I tell you,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.400]   "do not worry about your life,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.680]   "but what are you gonna eat, what are you gonna drink,
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   "what you're gonna wear," all that stuff,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   we covered last week, he says,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320]   "Look at the birds of the air."
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   So remember, they're outside.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.960]   My guess is he sees some birds overhead and he's like,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.400]   "Man, let me try to explain to this audience what I mean."
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.880]   They don't sow or reap or gather in barns.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.120]   Now we don't use sow and reap
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.200]   'cause most of us live in the city,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.320]   but that's basically like, hey, they don't plant crops
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.720]   and then harvest and pull up those crops
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.600]   and then store 'em up and calculate
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.840]   how much food do we have for the next winter.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.040]   All of which Jesus' audience would have done.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.520]   And yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.480]   Are you, here's the question,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.000]   are you not much more valuable to God than a bird?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.360]   Jesus asks.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.320]   It's like he says, "Hey, look at those birds.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   "See them flying up there?
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.640]   "They don't do any of the responsible things that you do
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.960]   "in terms of food, providing, but God provides for them."
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   Are you not more valuable to God than they are?
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   Won't he provide for you?
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.400]   Hey, tell us, he wouldn't say food
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.120]   'cause most of us, we don't wake up worrying about food,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.200]   but he'd say, "The birds, they don't store away
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.760]   "for a 401k in retirement someday.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.040]   "They're not on Bumble and Hinge
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.720]   "and trying to put themselves in feelers out there
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.240]   "to make sure that anybody who's available,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.200]   "they know that you're available and get a mate.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   "They're not saving up and following a budget
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.360]   "to get out of debt.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.480]   "They're not filling out applications
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.320]   "and trying to get a job.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   "They're not doing any of the responsible things
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   "that you do and God provides for them."
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.280]   It's like Jesus saying, "The birds, they don't even really try.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.480]   "They don't even try and God provides for them.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.720]   "They just fly around and they're like,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   "'Oh, look, there's a worm and I'll eat the worm.'
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.440]   "And then they find a spouse, not through match.com,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.480]   "but through like, 'Oh, look, she looks kind of hot.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.520]   "'I'm gonna mate with her.'
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.360]   "And then got little baby birds and then it gets cold."
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.720]   And they're like, "I think we should go south."
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.600]   And yet God provides for them.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.480]   Do you not think you're more valuable to God
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.000]   than those birds he provides for?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.280]   Most of us probably again would say,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.600]   "No, no, no, I think I am."
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.800]   But Jesus would say, "When you're worried,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.520]   "you don't really believe that.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.760]   "You don't really think God has promised to meet your needs."
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.400]   What we're gonna look at for the next handful of minutes
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   is one idea.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.920]   Normally I do three points
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.240]   and here's the things I wanna break down.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   I wanna hammer home one of the most significant truths
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.480]   you can believe in this entire series.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.440]   God, if you're a Christian,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.360]   remember your heavenly father
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   has promised to provide for your needs.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.160]   You've gotta remember as you go through life,
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.640]   when you turn this off tonight,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.880]   you could take a deep breath
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.520]   and I wonder how your life would change
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.440]   if you really went,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.120]   he's gonna provide for everything I need.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.800]   My heavenly father will provide for everything that I need.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.160]   Not everything that I want,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   not everything's always gonna go the way that I want it to,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.680]   but if I need it, I'll get it.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.560]   'Cause my heavenly father controls everything
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.640]   and he has promised to provide for everything that I need.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.560]   Jesus is not saying, "Hey, don't try at life.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.960]   "Don't work hard, don't stay on a budget."
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.160]   It's not some weird life coach being like,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.120]   "Oh yeah, just sit on your hands,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.600]   "everything will go fine, you'll get everything you want."
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.440]   No, it's not.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.600]   If I wouldn't teach that, it says, "Be responsible,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.240]   "fill out applications, get on a hinge."
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.880]   I probably shouldn't even speak about a hinge
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.800]   'cause I don't know anything about it.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.320]   But do all of the things that you're gonna do responsibly.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   But at the end of the day, God has promised,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.800]   he's gonna meet your needs.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.040]   He will provide for what you need.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   And you can trust him.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.320]   You are more valuable to God than a bird
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.560]   and he provides for them.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.840]   When God looks at you,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.180]   he looks at someone that was made in his own image,
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.680]   someone distinct from all of creation.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.680]   Do you know how valuable you are to God?
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.400]   When people see the Grand Canyon, they're like,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.200]   "Oh my gosh, this is amazing, it's incredible."
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.480]   See the Rocky Mountains, like, "Oh wow, that's astounding."
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.020]   When God sees those things, he's like,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.160]   "Ah, Jan, they pale in comparison to you.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.240]   "You were made in his image.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.400]   "You were the one that he died for.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.080]   "That's how valuable you are."
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.040]   And he's promised, "I will meet your needs.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.120]   "You're more valuable to me than a bird."
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.000]   What I love about that question is,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   did you know that Jesus,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.060]   and I know I talked with some of y'all before this,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.840]   Jesus actually talks about the value of a bird,
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.680]   like the specific monetary amount of a bird
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.120]   in the book of Matthew.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.720]   It's one of the few times in the Bible
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.020]   where something's monetary value is actually said.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.180]   And like most of the time, we're not told like,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.340]   "Oh, you know that oranges go for like a baker's dozen
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.880]   "to get to $2."
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.480]   It's one of the few times we're told,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.440]   "How much do birds cost?"
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.400]   In Matthew chapter 10, in case you're wondering, like,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.140]   "Oh, well, hey, am I more valuable to God than a bird?
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.000]   "Well, how valuable is a bird?"
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.500]   Jesus says four chapters later,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.280]   "Two sparrows are sold for a penny,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   "yet not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.140]   "outside of your father's care.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.340]   "Even the very hairs on your head are numbered.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.760]   "So don't be afraid.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.560]   "You're worth far more than many sparrows."
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.860]   Jesus says, "You guys are worth,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.200]   "you know how much a bird is worth.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.720]   "Two for a penny, I'm not the best at math,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.120]   "still count my fingers sometimes,
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.620]   "but even I know, oh, it's half a penny.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.260]   "How much is a bird worth?
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.660]   "Are you more valuable to God than half a penny?"
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.460]   He gave the life of his son.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.280]   There's nothing more valuable in life,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.780]   in the world, in creation.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.960]   It's how valuable you are to God.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.280]   And he's promised, "I will provide for your needs.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   "I got you.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.940]   "You're worth more than many birds,
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.720]   "and I will provide for everything you need.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   "You can trust me and rest and remember."
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.840]   This is the whole point, if you take notes, just one.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.320]   "Your heavenly father will provide for your needs."
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.280]   He drives home the same point when he goes into clothes,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.240]   talking about, they're worried about food,
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.840]   worried about clothes, covers both of them.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.760]   He says, "Why do you worry about clothes?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.160]   "See how the flowers in the field grow?
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   "They don't labor and spin,
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.540]   "which is like they're not over there knitting
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.760]   "and putting things together,"
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.920]   which his audience would have done.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.220]   "Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all of his splendor
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.680]   "was dressed like one of these."
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.580]   So Jesus points and he's like, "You're worried about clothes.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.580]   "Look how fine-looking those flowers are over there."
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.260]   And he says, "Not even Solomon
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.960]   "looked as good as these guys."
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.120]   Now, you may not know who Solomon was.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   Solomon lived 1,000 years before Jesus.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.360]   He was a king in Israel,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.080]   and he was known for being the guy who had,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.660]   he was the richest of the rich,
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.600]   arguably one of the richest people, say, in history, period,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.960]   but certainly the richest in all of society
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.360]   and ancient Jewish history
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.680]   and the richest person in the Bible.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.000]   And he says, "Not even Solomon was dressed that way."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.480]   In other words, Solomon was the guy on MTV Cribs,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.840]   if you showed up and they did pan in at his house,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.120]   Solomon would be sitting out front in front of his Lambos
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.720]   and his posh crib and be like, "Welcome to my place,"
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.160]   just decked out in the finest clothes, Gucci everywhere.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.120]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.880]   And just the finest clothes you could have.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.560]   And Jesus says, "Not even the guy
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.320]   "who would have won best dressed in high school
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.360]   "or in the Old Testament compared anything
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.680]   "to these flowers over here."
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.480]   God's gonna dress the flowers of the field.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.160]   He's thinking he doesn't care about you.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.440]   He's promised he'll meet your needs.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.240]   You could trust him.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.120]   The fire, he says, let me read it.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.840]   "If that's how God clothes the grass of the field,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   "which is here today and tomorrow's thrown into the fire,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.280]   "will he not much more clothe you?"
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.800]   And just a side note, in case you're reading this
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.640]   and you're like, "Wait,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.520]   "why are they throwing flowers into the fire?
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.840]   "That is weird."
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   And that would be an appropriate question.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.620]   Oftentimes we read the Bible so much, like Christians,
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.760]   that we're so desensitized to things like this.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   Like, yes, oh yeah, it is.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.680]   That's exactly what I do with flowers.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.000]   I throw them in the fire.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.180]   Why would you throw flowers in the fire, Jesus?
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.480]   Well, the word fire is a Greek word for oven.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.040]   And the way that you would cook back then
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.160]   is every home had a little oven inside of it.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.920]   And the way that you would get the fire started
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.880]   is you'd put kindling underneath,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.480]   and that kindling would have been made of wild flowers.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.040]   You take those wild flowers, you put them underneath,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.360]   and that would be how you start a fire and begin to cook.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.760]   Jesus is basically saying,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.080]   you know, the flowers that you guys bring home,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.040]   like back then, if you brought home roses,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.680]   a bouquet of roses, it wasn't like,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.800]   "Oh, honey, I love you so much."
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.200]   It was like, "Hey, I brought home cooking supplies."
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.440]   And Jesus says, "You know, you guys,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.160]   "these cooking supplies,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.660]   "here and then they're gone, we burn 'em.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.520]   "You're way more valuable to God."
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.480]   Something that just disappears.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.280]   You're so valuable, He died for you.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.800]   And you don't think He's gonna provide for you.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:46.320]   He then says this, "Oh, you of little faith."
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.360]   This is a really interesting term.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.840]   The word, "Oh, you of little faith," it's only two words.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.400]   In English, we translated it to five,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.040]   but in the original Greek, it's only two.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.920]   And did you guys watch "Seinfeld" in here?
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.080]   Were you alive when "Seinfeld" was on?
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.960]   Did you watch "Seinfeld"?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.400]   Ah, this is not an endorsement of "Seinfeld,"
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.000]   but I have seen every episode of "Seinfeld,"
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.160]   whether or not I would endorse or encourage that,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.000]   but it's probably the only show
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.960]   that I've seen every episode at least one time.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   I think it's the funniest comedic show of all time.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.600]   It destroys friends in "Gilmore Girls."
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.400]   Let me get that out of the way for everybody,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.700]   talking to you, and yeah, so savage.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.160]   But inside of the show, there were just like
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.520]   all these comedic, hilarious things.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.080]   There's Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, George.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.360]   In one of the shows, there was this moment where,
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.080]   part of the, man, I'm just talking with friends,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   my favorite show, in one of the episodes,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.480]   Elaine is dating a guy, you guys following me?
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.160]   And every time you date somebody, you're kind of like,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.280]   is this relationship gonna work out?
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.800]   And in "Seinfeld," there were always these
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   hilarious quirks that would end the relationship.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.400]   Like one girl had man hands, or Jerry was dating her,
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.880]   and he was like, "Her hands are just too big,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.720]   "I just can't get over it."
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.460]   And another person was like, they,
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.200]   I can't even remember some of the different reasons
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.080]   why they ended up breaking up.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.320]   But this one was one where Elaine, the girl,
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.560]   was starting to date this new guy, he's introduced,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.360]   comes over, and we're introduced to him,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.340]   and all of a sudden, everyone sees he's a close talker.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.600]   Like they begin to pan through, like he's meeting everybody,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.680]   and every time he would talk, he'd be uncomfortably close
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.000]   to that person and talking.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.920]   And the joke was, he's a close talker.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.260]   And the guy ends up leaving, and Elaine is sitting there
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.480]   with the guys, and everyone basically is like,
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.240]   you need to break up with him, he's a close talker.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   He's one of those guys that all of us have
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.120]   this person in our life where they have no sense
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.240]   of like personal space.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.520]   They get so close that you end up having to back up
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.640]   a little bit, and you can feel their breath breathing on you
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.920]   'cause they're a close talker.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.880]   And it's hilarious.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.360]   Well, why is it hilarious?
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.480]   Well, close talker is not a term in the dictionary.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.160]   It's a made up term.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.760]   But my guess is everybody here, even when I said that,
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.260]   you knew exactly what I meant.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.160]   Right?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.920]   That's essentially what Jesus does with this word
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.880]   of you of little faith.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.800]   Now, here's why I say that.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   Just like close talker is not in the dictionary,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.680]   it's just two words that you hyphenate,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.360]   and you're like close talker.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.840]   That's what you are.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.880]   Jesus, and the term for OU of little faith,
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   involves the word for little and faith or faither.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's a word that only Jesus in the entire Bible used,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   and nowhere else in any Greek literature
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.400]   do we have the word that he just said there,
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.320]   that OU of little faith.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.240]   They're like, oh, that's normal.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.400]   Nope, Jesus made this word up,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.840]   and it was a combination of two words, little and faither.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.960]   And just like close talker, or just like,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.520]   oh, you're a Debbie Downer, where it's like,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   oh, I know what you mean when you say that.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.800]   His audience knew what he mean, where Jesus says,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.840]   you believe God provides for all of these things,
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.240]   but he won't provide for you.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.400]   You're a little faither.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.560]   In a comedic way, he's pointing out like, man,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.160]   you think God holds the moon, sun, stars, all of gravity,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360]   like he created it all, everything incredible
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.160]   that you've ever seen, the majesty of just the stars
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.800]   at night, the intricacy of the human body,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.720]   and the fact that reproduction or birth,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.880]   I don't know if you've ever thought about that,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.780]   but all the things that are amazing,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.960]   and you don't think that he will provide for you,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.160]   you're a little faither.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.880]   And he points out there's a relationship
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.720]   between the size of our faith and the size of our worry.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.320]   And he says, you can trust me.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.160]   I got you.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.120]   I will provide for your needs.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.320]   Your heavenly father is in control.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.760]   Listen to me.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.000]   He will provide for everything that you need.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.760]   If you need it, he will provide it.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.860]   He showed how clearly that is true
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.920]   when he died on the cross for your greatest need.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.300]   The greatest need you will ever have in life
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.960]   is the fact that every action, every sinful decision
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.880]   that I've made and that you have made
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   have put us in debt to God or deserving of punishment.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.100]   Just like anytime you were a kid
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.800]   and you acted up against your parents,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.720]   there would be consequences or deserving of punishment.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.560]   Just like anytime you break the law,
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   there's punishments, consequences, fines, jail time,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.620]   things like that.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.840]   All of us through our own decisions have broken God's law
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.040]   and deserve to be punished.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.060]   And God has said, I will allow you to not have the punishment
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.960]   because I'll give my son to take
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.100]   and pay for your punishment, pay for your sins,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.300]   pay for your crimes.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.360]   That's how far I'll go to provide for your needs,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.520]   your greatest need.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.620]   You don't think I can help you
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   with the presentation you got this week?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.320]   You're a little faither.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.700]   You don't think I can get you a job?
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.540]   You don't think I can provide for your needs?
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.620]   You don't think I'm big enough to handle
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.180]   whatever you're walking through?
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.840]   You're a little faither.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.060]   And in a comedic, brilliant, clear way,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.280]   Jesus says, you can trust your heavenly father.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.700]   He's got you, controls everything.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.100]   He will provide for your needs.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.060]   Even by saying the idea of don't worry,
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.860]   which he says four times in this passage,
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.020]   four different times, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.960]   He's implying, I got you.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.200]   Why do I say that?
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.960]   You cannot be a good God and say, I got you,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.660]   but I'm not gonna provide for you.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.640]   Why do I say that, or why do I say that?
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.820]   You can't be a good friend and say that.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.160]   Like, here's what I mean.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.400]   If we were leaving tonight, and we were all going to eat,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.360]   and we were getting ready to drive together,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.600]   and I was like, dude, you can ride with me.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.860]   And as we're walking out to the parking lot,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.680]   you begin to realize, oh man, I forgot my wallet.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.080]   And I looked at you and I said, don't worry about it.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.880]   Get in the car, drive to the restaurant,
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.320]   get to the restaurant, sit down, eat.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.080]   At the end of the meal, waitress comes up,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.680]   hey, you guys want one check or two checks?
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.760]   If I look at her and say, we'll take two checks,
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   you would look at me and go, what do you mean two checks?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.480]   I told you I didn't have my wallet,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.960]   and you said, don't worry about it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.080]   And if I responded with,
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.080]   (laughs)
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.920]   you thought I was gonna pay for you?
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.600]   No, I'm not gonna pay for you,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.680]   I just didn't want you to worry.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.840]   Worry's never a healthy, productive use of time.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.680]   It doesn't make you feel good,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.560]   it's bad for your blood pressure.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.240]   You would look at me like, you're a bad friend,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.880]   and a little crazy, and you would be right.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.360]   'Cause you can't be a good friend and say,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.820]   don't worry about it, but I don't got you.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.160]   You can't be a good, perfect, heavenly father
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.060]   and say, don't worry about it, but I don't got you.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.320]   He's telling you, I will provide for your needs.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.960]   You can trust me.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.760]   He hammers this home in the final verses
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.600]   of the passage where he says,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.680]   therefore, do not be anxious about anything.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.160]   Or do not be anxious saying, what should we eat,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   and what should we drink?
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.280]   What should we wear?
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.320]   Where am I gonna work, where am I gonna live?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.160]   Who am I gonna marry?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.000]   Will I be able to have kids?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.880]   Don't be anxious about those things.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.520]   For the Gentiles, that's a word for people
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.480]   who don't have a relationship with God.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.760]   Christians, we would use the word non-believers.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   Non-believers run after all of those things.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.440]   And your heavenly father knows that you need them all.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.760]   He will provide for you.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.120]   You can trust him.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.760]   He's invited all of us.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.400]   Work hard, be responsible.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.080]   Fill out the job application.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.640]   Get ready for the presentation.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.240]   Do everything you can to prepare for interviewing.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.320]   But at the end of the day, you don't have to worry.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.840]   He's promised he will provide for your needs.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.920]   He's the one who says, get in the car.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.200]   You don't need your wallet.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.040]   You can ride with me, I'll drive, and I got you.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.880]   You can trust me.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.440]   You know what the second most repeated command is?
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.200]   You guys know this 'cause, Alison, do you know?
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.520]   What's the second most repeated command in the Bible?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   I wouldn't have known it had I not been preparing for this.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.560]   The most repeated command in the Bible
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.520]   we've talked about is do not fear.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.280]   There's an Olympic ceremony.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.120]   Number one, who would get the gold medal in the Bible
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.040]   for most repeated command?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   Do not fear.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.320]   The second most repeated command in the Bible,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.040]   who'd get silver?
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.840]   Remember, remember, remember.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.920]   This whole message.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   Remember who your heavenly father is.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.360]   Remember God will provide for your needs.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.920]   Over and over and over, he says, remember.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.040]   Remember what he has done.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.920]   Remember who your God is.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.480]   Remember what he can do, what he will do.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.280]   Remember his promises to you.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.480]   Over and over, he says, remember,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.840]   and he probably does because he knows
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.240]   we are people with very short attention spans.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   Even before this, we were joking
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.320]   that the iPhone has not helped.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.520]   It's made our attention span like that of a goldfish,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.120]   or even shorter than a goldfish.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.000]   We're so quick to forget and to move on.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.480]   It's hard to remember what I had for breakfast,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.160]   let alone God's provision, his promise, who he is.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.760]   He says, remember, I've got you.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.720]   When you're feeling anxious, when you're feeling concerned,
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.800]   let the promise that I've given you,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.600]   I will provide for your needs, wash over you.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.240]   Not all of your wants, we're gonna talk about that
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.200]   in weeks ahead, everything you need, I got you.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.720]   You can trust me.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:35.680]   A promise that he most clearly kept on the cross.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.520]   You know, the idea of a dog mom,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.440]   and I'll close the plane or land here.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.200]   The idea that Emily loves her dog,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.440]   or the fact that God loves us more
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.080]   than Emily loves her dog,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.680]   it's not really hard for me to believe that.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.640]   I think that's true.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   It's pretty easy for me to be like,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.160]   yeah, God clearly loves us more than she loves her dog,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.200]   if she won't admit it.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.720]   But the idea that God loves us more
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.800]   than any parent loves their child,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.720]   that stretches my faith.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.400]   I've got two kids.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.080]   I can't even put into words how much I love my kids.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.880]   The fact that God loves me more than I love my kids,
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.160]   like I wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.880]   and I get sad thinking about how my,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.600]   I got a four-year-old son, a two-year-old daughter,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.280]   and they're at that stage in life,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.840]   you don't even probably know what I'm talking about,
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.560]   their baby fat is just like disappearing.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.080]   You're like, oh no, God, please don't let it go too fast.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.880]   And I wake up thinking of just heartbroken over,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.480]   there's gonna come a day I'm gonna be separated from them.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.160]   If Jesus doesn't come back, one of us will die soon,
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.520]   or one of us will die before the other.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   All of which is for the point of, I love my kids so much,
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.120]   it's hard for me to imagine that God could love me, you,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.800]   more, like it makes me irrational
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.120]   how much I love my kids sometimes.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.240]   Like my wife came home recently from swim lessons
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.480]   for my son, who's four, who was going through it,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.080]   and she began to explain as I asked her,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.200]   like how did swim lessons go?
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   He's trying to learn to swim.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.720]   She was like, oh, it kind of went okay, didn't do great,
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.160]   like he didn't really like the drills,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.320]   he didn't do great at 'em,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.940]   wasn't as good as the other kids,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.840]   and I just feel like he had a bad attitude
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.480]   because of that the whole time.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.080]   I hear that, and a normal person would be like,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.040]   oh, well, I'm sure I'll get 'em next time.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   As his father, because I so love him,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.000]   like an irrational protectiveness snaps in on my head
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.200]   where I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, really?
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.280]   Really, swim lessons?
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.160]   That, hey, you're gonna do me like that, huh?
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.280]   Who do you think you are, swim lessons?
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.440]   We don't need you.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.360]   We don't need to swim.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.400]   We ain't living in an island somewhere.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.620]   Why are we even doing swim lessons?
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.360]   If anybody's gonna mess with my, who,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.820]   I'm gonna go find swim lessons right now.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.200]   Right now I'm gonna find it.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.280]   As though swim lessons is something like bully from school,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.320]   but as his dad, it's hard not to.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.100]   I love him so much.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.480]   Snap into a protective mode that doesn't even make sense
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.880]   'cause I love him.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.400]   And the Bible says there's no parent on the planet
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.780]   who loves their son or daughter more than God loves you.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.400]   There's no husband who loves their wife
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.600]   more than God loves you.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.680]   There's no wife who loves her husband
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.080]   more than God loves you.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.600]   There's no person who loves their family member
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.360]   more than God loves you.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.200]   He proved it.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.440]   He's promised, I will provide for your needs.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.560]   We're gonna talk in this series
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.400]   about a lot of different things related to anxiety,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.860]   but you have to know if you're a believer, you can rest.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   God has promised you, listen to me.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.760]   I got you.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.440]   I will provide.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.760]   I love you.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.560]   I provided by giving my life for you
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.920]   and I will provide for your needs.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.320]   Trust me.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.180]   Remember.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.160]   Let me pray.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.120]   Father, I pray for anyone right now.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.760]   And there are thousands
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.140]   who are hearing this and will hear this message
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.360]   who are anxious.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.400]   They're afraid.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.380]   Feels like they can't conquer it
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.820]   and they run back to it every single day.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.380]   They're flooded with emotions and fear and their heart races.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.340]   You would help them remember in those moments
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.580]   who their father is, your promise, your provision.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.720]   You're in control.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.740]   They can trust you.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.460]   And that they would rest in that and they would trust you.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.560]   I pray that you throughout this series
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.800]   would become bigger and more real
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.720]   than any fear or anything in their life.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.960]   And you'd have all of us to trust you.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.640]   The father who loves us, who made us,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.560]   who wants more for us and more peace in our life
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.260]   than we even want for ourself.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.440]   Help us to experience that.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   Pray for anyone who's never trusted in Jesus.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.540]   This would be their night
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.680]   and they wouldn't just experience earthly peace,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.160]   but eternal peace through being forgiven,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:09.200]   which they can accept when they accept
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.240]   the work that you did on the cross in their place.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.280]   We love you, in Christ's name, amen.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
