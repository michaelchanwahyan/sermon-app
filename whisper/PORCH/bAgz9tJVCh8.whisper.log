[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.160]   Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.560]   We doing OK tonight?
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.760]   Come on, let's go.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.720]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.960]   The brave and the bold, man.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280]   You decided that you're not going
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.840]   to let any cold weather keep you back.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   You decided to make it here in the room tonight.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.940]   So glad you did.
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.240]   Also, so glad that we've got some friends joining us
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.840]   online tonight.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.440]   Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.520]   Porch Live Indie, Porch Live Scottsdale, Porch Live Fresno.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.240]   We love you guys.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.680]   So glad that you're tuning in with us this evening.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.200]   Well, chances are, if you're going to move cities,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.480]   you're more than likely going to do so because of work
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.840]   at some point in your life.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.340]   That's the case for some of you here.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.880]   Like you're in Dallas, Texas because your job brought you
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.380]   here.
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200]   You didn't necessarily choose to be here.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.160]   Your job required you to be here.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.600]   Or maybe you're tuning in and it's not that you live here.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.160]   You live wherever it is you are.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.480]   And it's because work just required it, man.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.920]   You decided to make the move.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.440]   This happened for me a little bit later in life
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   than it did for many, many young adults.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.840]   You see, I went to Texas A&M University.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.560]   There you are.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.200]   Can always count on you guys.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.440]   And I actually lived in College Station
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.840]   for a little bit of time after I graduated.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.560]   I decided to hang out, catch a little bit more of the scenery.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.440]   But eventually, I did get an offer
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.960]   that took me away from the city and into Houston, Texas.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.200]   I didn't know anything about Houston.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.720]   Brooke and I, we're not from there.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.400]   We were unfamiliar with the area.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   So all we know is that at some point,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   the Astros decided to cheat in pursuit
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.040]   of winning the World Series.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.880]   That's all we knew.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.040]   We didn't know much else.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.720]   And so what we decided is we've got
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.920]   to get to know the landscape of the land a little bit.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.600]   And we have to find an apartment as soon as possible
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.880]   because my transition was coming very, very quickly.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.920]   So we took a weekend.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.760]   We booked a bunch of reservations.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.400]   We decided to go through a variety of apartments.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   And we landed on one that felt really good.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.260]   You see, the apartment that we found,
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.640]   it was in a really good location, a nice pocket of town.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.440]   It was near good restaurants, not far from my workplace.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900]   It was a first floor unit,
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.800]   which is great if you're carrying groceries.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.400]   And so we were really excited about it,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.960]   except there was one minor catch.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.460]   And that catch is we weren't actually able to tour
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.100]   the unit that we were planning to lease,
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.940]   which I don't know if you've ever been in that spot,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.740]   but that's a pretty uneasy feeling
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.380]   because you don't necessarily know what you're going to get.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.720]   Sure, you can look around
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.700]   and you can assess some of the quality of the place,
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   but you really want to step foot into the actual apartment
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.400]   that you're going to call your own.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.760]   Our property manager understood our uneasiness.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   And so to assuage our fear,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.000]   she decided to take us through a model unit,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.520]   a unit that was identical to the one we'd be moving into.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.400]   And so we walked in and it was nice.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.480]   Like it was like freshly painted walls and cleaned floors
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.680]   and new light fixtures.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.040]   And there was a fireplace in the living area.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.880]   It felt great.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.060]   So we decided, you know what, let's take the risk.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.780]   We're going to sign the lease.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.120]   So the weekend finally comes.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   We make our way from College Station.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.940]   We drive down to Houston, Texas, and we're excited.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.060]   Like this is a new chapter of life.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.460]   Like this is a new adventure for Brooke and I.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.800]   Like this is a new job, yes,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.000]   but it's also a new city and it's new people.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.800]   And this is a new home for us as well.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.720]   And so we decide to get to the apartment
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.060]   and collect the keys and make our way to our unit.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.580]   And as we go to unlock the door,
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.160]   we push it open and to our horror,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   it looked nothing like what we had been promised.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.120]   We had been promised one thing,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.480]   but we were given something else entirely.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.760]   Like in place of the walls being freshly painted,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   they were freshly stained with, I still don't know what.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.760]   It was gross to look at.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.820]   Instead of the floors being perfectly cleaned,
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.260]   there were little hairballs floating around
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.700]   in the corners of the apartment.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.320]   So much so that I can actually tell you the color
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.780]   of the previous tenants hair.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.860]   Where we thought that we were gonna get an apartment
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.460]   that backed up to this running trail
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.740]   and this quaint little Creek
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.220]   that kind of cut through the woodland forest.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.220]   Like what we found instead was a stinking smelling swamp.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.800]   We were set into an apartment,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.140]   the likes of which not only missed our expectations,
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.020]   but like mocked our expectations.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.660]   Like we had been promised one thing,
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.620]   but we were given something else entirely.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.980]   You ever been in that spot?
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.560]   Has that ever been your reality?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.880]   Maybe it's not the place you live.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.720]   Maybe it was instead a show that you loved.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.280]   Like you watched every episode.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.220]   Like you made sure to track with the characters.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.840]   You felt like you grew up alongside of them.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.220]   And then finally the final season shows up
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.280]   and you've been waiting for this moment.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.360]   You can't wait for it to all drop.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.920]   And you sit down and you're like,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.400]   what the heck just happened?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.760]   This show did not finish the way
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.260]   that it was supposed to finish.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.100]   Maybe it wasn't that.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.880]   Maybe it was instead you bought a piece of furniture.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.240]   You know, the perfect final addition to your living space.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.880]   It was at the perfect price.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.280]   And sure it came from Ikea,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.280]   but it said some assembly would already be completed.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   And yet it showed up on your doorstep
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.360]   and you realize no, no assembly has been completed.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.120]   All assembly is in fact required.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   Maybe it's not something so trivial.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.000]   Maybe it's actually something
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.120]   a little bit more material than that.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   Maybe it wasn't that you moved jobs
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   or you moved to a new city because of a new job,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.280]   but you actually earned a new promotion.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.120]   It was like, oh my gosh,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.820]   like this is everything that I've wanted.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.480]   Like I'm in a new city, sure.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.000]   I'm in a new department, great.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   But man, I'm finally getting to work in the position
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.120]   that I've longed for to a boss that I actually respect
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.840]   until you realize that boss is a real piece of work.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.660]   And the job is not nearly as fulfilling as you thought.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.880]   That's a material disappointment.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.720]   Maybe it wasn't that.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.000]   Maybe finally you got up the courage to ask her out.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.580]   You've been reading the signs.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.880]   You knew like the moment had arrived.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.440]   And so you boldly walked across the room
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.680]   and you asked her if she had plans Friday night
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.240]   and you to your horror learned
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.340]   and she didn't have any interest in dating you.
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.480]   She only had interest in flirting with you.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.720]   But what do you do when the disappointment
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.120]   goes even further than that?
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   Like when the disappointment,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.920]   it affects more than your life alone.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.580]   It actually affects your soul too.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Because the disappointment, it isn't just situational.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.440]   Like it's not just out there in the world.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.380]   It's actually spiritual.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.040]   It's in here in a room like this
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.160]   amongst a people like us coming from a guy like me.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.700]   What do you do when you face disappointment in the church?
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.760]   When you trusted that pastor,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.680]   you felt safe with that leader,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.200]   you thought your peers, the Christians around you
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.660]   were supposed to be innocent until they weren't.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.440]   What do you do in that moment
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.420]   when you face that level of betrayal?
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.040]   Well, for many of you, you deconstruct.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   You do what we described as a week one.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.380]   Like you went through a crisis of faith
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.120]   that led at least to a reevaluation of your Christianity
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.320]   and at most to a total abandonment of it.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.540]   And honestly, like who can blame you?
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.120]   Like I won't bore you with the stats,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.200]   but if you look at the trends in our culture,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.220]   more young adults today are leaving the church,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.080]   not because their devious atheistic professor
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.140]   finally got to them,
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:01.520]   but because a religious altruistic minister
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.860]   actually failed them.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.920]   Many people are leaving as a result of that.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.880]   Like whether it was perpetuating a system of abuse
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.400]   instead of calling out sin,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.000]   defending some political power
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   rather than loving their neighbors,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.280]   frequenting massage parlors for secret sexual favors,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.480]   controlling the headlines to hide some hypocrisy,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.500]   or defending a leader as opposed to holding him accountable
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.720]   for his actions.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   Many in our generation, some of you included,
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.080]   you just can't get on board with this.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.320]   Like if this is what's true of them,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.640]   then why would I ever want that to be true of me?
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.480]   If that's you, I'm really glad you're here.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.080]   Because though that may be true for the ethereal them,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.420]   it's not at all true of him.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.440]   It's not true of Jesus.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.400]   Like yes, the church can hurt, but Christ can save.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.520]   Christ can save, and so often he saves those
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.480]   that the church tries to hurt.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.440]   You see it all throughout his life.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.560]   Like he identified with Zacchaeus, that wee little man.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.000]   Like he decided that despite everyone's ridicule,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.480]   he actually wanted to go and be hosted at his house.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.960]   Like he healed the bleeding woman,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.920]   the very woman that the rest of society
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.760]   had decided to extort instead.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.440]   He wanted to heal her.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.480]   He touched the leper,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.220]   that guy that nobody wanted anything to do with.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.080]   Don't touch him, he'll make you unclean.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.040]   Jesus said, "No, I won't only heal him.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.320]   "I will actually touch him myself,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.480]   "and I will identify with him personally."
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.080]   He pursued the demoniac,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.560]   that guy that lived in a place no one went to,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   and he did some things that nobody wanted.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.600]   Jesus decided to go for that guy all by himself.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.900]   He defended Mary.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.180]   Like when she sat in the seat of the disciple,
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.680]   at his feet, listening to his teaching,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.360]   and the rest of his disciples ridiculed her,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.760]   he actually defended her instead.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.600]   He welcomes tax collectors, sinners, prostitutes.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.560]   He breaks bread with them,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   though the rest of the religious
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.400]   would scrutinize him for it.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.960]   You see, Jesus did for them
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   what I think he wants to do for some of you tonight.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew 23.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.120]   Matthew 23.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.160]   Let me just say this too, from the outset,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.400]   we've got some technical difficulties.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.600]   The scripture will not be behind me tonight.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.040]   My points will not be behind me tonight.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.280]   Some of you look really disappointed in that reality.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.880]   You had expectations, and they just didn't get met tonight.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   Here's what I would say.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.160]   As we were fielding this issue a moment ago,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.020]   I think the enemy really doesn't want this to happen.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.280]   I think he's really terrified about the possibilities
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.800]   of what could take place in this room
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.280]   over the course of these next few moments together.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.100]   So be patient with us.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.920]   As we read, I'll go slow.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.400]   Why Matthew chapter 23?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.800]   Because we've been in a series called "Deconstructed."
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.960]   And the whole idea behind it
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.160]   is we wanna help you rebuild your reality.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.440]   You see, we think there's a way
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.760]   to actually question your faith without losing it.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   Like, I think it's actually possible
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.400]   to contend with your confusion, to face your frustrations,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   and not just deconstruct parts of your belief,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.080]   but actually reconstruct something strong instead.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.220]   And if you were here two weeks ago,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.280]   then what you know is that this is part two
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.720]   of a talk rooted in this specific passage
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.920]   that we're looking at tonight.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.120]   In this passage, Jesus comes to the Pharisees
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   and the scribes, and he calls them out.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.000]   Pharisees and scribes
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.800]   are some of the religious leaders of his day.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.440]   And so he decides to call them out,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.880]   confront them through a series of woes.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.560]   And what we know is that the context of this conversation
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.480]   is the last week of Jesus's life.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.640]   It's actually a Tuesday in Holy Week.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.040]   Jesus is repping Tuesdays, you know?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.880]   And so he decides to call out these religious leaders
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.280]   the last week of his life.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.720]   Now, if you had one week of life to live,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.600]   what would you do with it?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.080]   My guess, I could be wrong,
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.000]   but my guess is you're probably
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.760]   not exposing religious corruption.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.320]   But that's what Jesus does.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.120]   Like, you think you have an issue with Christian hypocrisy?
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.400]   Jesus has more.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.480]   And what we see as he calls out the religious leaders
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.200]   is that he pronounces seven woes against them.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.240]   A woe is a judgment.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.360]   And so he calls them out for a variety of ways
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.400]   that they've led the people not closer to God,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.680]   but further from God.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.320]   And as he pronounces these woes,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.920]   we know that we caught four of them
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.200]   the last time we were together.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.040]   And those four, just to recap,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.120]   to keep you up to speed in case you missed it,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.360]   were that you should beware of those
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.000]   who stress aptitude over attitude.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.240]   Beware those who stress aptitude over attitude.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.720]   That was the first thing that Jesus warned us of.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.440]   The second thing was beware those
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.960]   who convert to their cause rather than the kingdom.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.320]   Beware of those who convert to their cause
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.160]   rather than the kingdom.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.480]   The third of those woes was beware of those
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.360]   who leverage authority to escape accountability.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.340]   Beware of those who leverage their authority
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.040]   to escape accountability.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.240]   And then lastly, beware of those
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.960]   who emphasize small matters over big ones.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.440]   Beware of those who emphasize small matters
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.760]   over big matters.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.000]   Those were the first four woes.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.480]   We talked about that two weeks ago.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.400]   You can go catch the message
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.440]   if you wanna actually hear the explanation,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.520]   interpretation of all of that.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.160]   Tonight, we're gonna be looking at the last three.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.200]   Here's what you need to know about these seven woes.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   These seven woes are warnings for us
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.020]   against the dangers of religiosity.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.720]   But it's not just that it's gonna provide a warning,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.520]   it's also going to provide a way in which we should walk
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.440]   as we move in faith.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.280]   That's what we're gonna see.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.080]   So the last three woes are what we're gonna find here
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.640]   tonight.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.380]   Now, I should say this before I hop in.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:03.380]   It is sobering for me to teach through Jesus's,
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.660]   Jesus's judgments against the religious leaders,
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.360]   knowing full well that I am no exception,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.600]   that I myself stand in a seat where these same truths
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.520]   would apply to me very directly.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.960]   It doesn't escape me the reality that that's the case.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.720]   I'm grateful for the way that God has worked to refine me,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.520]   even just in studying it.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.800]   And so we're all subject to what this teaches tonight.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.680]   This is a scripture of great consequence for me
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.040]   as it is for you.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.640]   So let's get into it together, okay?
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   Matthew chapter 23, if you have a Bible,
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.880]   we're gonna start in verse 25.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.720]   It says this,
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.160]   woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.560]   for you clean the outside of the cup and the plate,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.640]   but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.400]   You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.800]   and the plate that the outside may also be clean.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.820]   The first thing that Jesus warns us tonight
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.280]   is that we should beware of those who prioritize image
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.460]   over innocence.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:10.600]   Beware of those who prioritize image over innocence.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.120]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.960]   but when I read a couple of verses like that,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.400]   I love it whenever the Bible
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.600]   just kind of jumps into my reality.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.800]   Like it engages me right where I am
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.460]   because I'm pretty particular when it comes to the dishes.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.920]   I'm not the guy that takes dishes with crumbs and food scum
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.200]   and just throws them in the dishwasher.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.400]   I don't believe that that works very effectively.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.480]   You may be like-minded to myself.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.040]   You believe that it needs to be scrubbed
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.400]   very cleanly on the inside.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.920]   Otherwise the dishwasher is not gonna get the job done.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.720]   Jesus is kind of talking about that,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.800]   but he's also talking about a little bit more.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.680]   You see, what you need to know
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.000]   is there's a deeper layer of meaning
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.420]   to the analogy that Jesus is addressing here.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.860]   He's targeting very directly the Pharisees
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.560]   because according to Jewish law,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.100]   different rabbinical camps at this time,
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.720]   they argued when a cup or a plate
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.040]   was considered ritually clean.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.920]   So one camp, they said that that cup was ritually clean
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   whenever the outside of it was cleansed.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.240]   The other camp said, no, no, no, that's not the case.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.040]   This cup is ritually clean
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.120]   whenever the inside of it is ritually cleansed.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.960]   Why does that matter?
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.720]   Because Jesus launches into that debate and he says,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.760]   guys, it's not so much about the cup.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.120]   This is much more about you.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   You clean yourself up on the outside,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.540]   but you are filthy on the inside.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.080]   You might look externally beautiful,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   but you are internally wicked.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.160]   You see, Jesus wants us to know
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   that true faith is about so much more than basic obedience.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.840]   It's about so much more than just doing the right things
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.860]   and saying the right things and looking the right ways.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.680]   It's about so much more than basic obedience.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.280]   It's actually about innocence.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.720]   Innocence, that you don't just do the right things,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.960]   you mean them, like they come from a pure heart within.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.120]   That it's not just what you do that matters,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   but it's how you do it that ultimately matters.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.040]   So let me give you some perspective
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.080]   on what Jesus is trying to say here with this cup analogy.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.760]   You've read about the Trojan War, in case you haven't.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.700]   What you need to know is that the Greeks
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.160]   are squaring off against the city of Troy
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160]   and they decide to leave a surprise gift
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.100]   for the city of Troy.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.440]   They create a Trojan horse.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.880]   It's an infamous gift because the city of Troy looks at it
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   and says, "This is a peace offering,"
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.740]   because it was beautiful on the outside.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.840]   And yet tucked away within,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.320]   that Trojan horse was not something beautiful,
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.060]   but something very lethal.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.160]   You see, it looked like it had all the trappings
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.240]   of innocence on the outside,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.400]   but inside it was anything but innocent.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.040]   It was filled with soldiers
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.840]   that could not penetrate the walls,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.560]   lest they tricked the city of Troy into letting them inside
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.720]   and they raided the city from within.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   And Jesus is looking at the Pharisees and the scribes
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.640]   and he's saying, "Hey, that's kind of like you guys.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.080]   "You look beautiful out here.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.260]   "You look trustworthy,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.240]   "but you're actually quite treacherous."
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.160]   That's why he calls them hypocrites.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.960]   Like in the original language,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.340]   when you read this in the Greek,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.280]   well, that's not quite the original language.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.040]   It's the earliest manuscript that we have.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.160]   When you read it there, the word for hypocrite,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.840]   it is the idea of an actor or a pretender.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.600]   It's someone that looks like something on the outside,
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.400]   but is actually something very different on the inside.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.560]   Like they have all the markings of good men,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.680]   and yet they have none of the motives.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.160]   Instead, they're motivated by what Jesus says is greed
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.120]   and self-indulgence.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.200]   Like they have a lust for public recognition
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.400]   and they lack self-control.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.380]   So much so that earlier in the chapter,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.540]   Jesus warns the rest of the crowd,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.820]   people like you and me,
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.260]   of what we should look out for
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.540]   when it comes to people like this.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.720]   He says in Matthew 23, if you go back up to verse five,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.980]   "They do all their deeds,"
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.540]   talking about the religious leaders,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.260]   "to be seen by others.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.760]   "For they make their phylacteries broad
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.540]   "and their fringes long."
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.300]   These are markings of piety.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.060]   It's a way that you would demonstrate your holiness,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.240]   a phylactery was a little leather box
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.000]   that they would wear on their forehead
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.780]   and they would wear on their arm.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.620]   And it contained copies of the scripture within it.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.180]   The tassels were signifying of their distinction
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.300]   as God's people.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.100]   And they love the places of honor at feasts.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.380]   They love the best seats in the synagogues
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.620]   and greetings in the marketplaces
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.420]   and being called rabbi by others.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.620]   Jesus is looking at the crowds and he's saying,
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.860]   "Hey, beware of those that carefully curate
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.300]   "their religious image."
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.180]   You be aware of those that only associate
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.840]   with the influential, that love to sit in the seats of power,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.660]   that want to be identified by very specific titles
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.640]   or professions that interact
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.340]   with a very exclusive group of people.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.160]   You see, Jesus knows that, as it was true then,
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.220]   and so it is true today.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.020]   People have always used God's platform to build their own.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.820]   People have always used God's platform to build their own.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.380]   So just to bring it all the way home for us,
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.860]   if the leaders in your life only ever sit
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.240]   in the green room backstage and they never traverse
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.020]   the halls where the rest of the people are,
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.900]   there's reason to be careful.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.220]   If they only ever repost clips of themself
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.460]   where you view their grid and it's only pictures of them
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.840]   and no one else, you have reason to be careful.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.580]   If they only interact with the socially significant
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.280]   other influencers, you have reason to be careful.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.200]   You see, Jesus wants us to know that it's not so much
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.020]   the prosperity gospel of times past
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.860]   that we should be concerned with,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.040]   instead it is the popularity gospel of times present
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.560]   that we should be more concerned with.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.020]   It's the fact that people, they will actually follow God
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.340]   to promote themselves.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.380]   And yet that's not what Jesus did.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.380]   Jesus never did that in his own ministry.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.980]   He never followed God to promote himself.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.340]   He followed God to promote you,
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.580]   to move you from death to life.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.300]   That's a pretty significant promotion.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.420]   From enemy of God to child of God,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.980]   that's a pretty significant promotion.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.220]   From belittled to beloved, from lost to found,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.500]   from slave to free.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.300]   Like this was the heart of Jesus for you.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.540]   He wanted to promote you out of your desolation
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.340]   and into exaltation.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.780]   He wanted to bring you closer to God
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.080]   than you could ever do on your own.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.220]   Now, let me be clear.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.220]   There's nothing wrong with excellent production
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.340]   and really, really, really impressive worship
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.340]   or buildings, the likes of which you're pretty awestruck by.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.420]   There's nothing wrong with those things.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.200]   Unless they only make much of the man
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.100]   and they never make much of the king.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.000]   Then there's an issue.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.120]   So I remember I had a dear friend,
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.840]   he was a pastor of mine,
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.080]   that was the best at prioritizing his innocence
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   rather than his image.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.320]   And he would tell me, "Kylin, whenever you preach,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.700]   "don't see the empty seats.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.480]   "See the full seats instead."
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.840]   He would tell me, "Kylin, whenever you walk
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.280]   "through the halls, move very slowly.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.340]   "If you're in a rush, people don't think
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.520]   "they can approach you, but if you go slow,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.000]   "they might actually come close."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.840]   And my favorite, he would tell me,
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.880]   "Kylin, collect uncommon badges of honor.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.360]   "A little makeup dust on the shoulder
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.740]   "from hugging a widow is of much greater value to God
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.900]   "than any number of compliments
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.500]   "you could earn after a sermon."
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.600]   We should desire to live lives of innocence,
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.940]   not ones that promote our image.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.540]   You see, what we need to know is what my friend knew,
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.380]   that what matters to God is less the magnitude
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.300]   of our ministry and more the magnitude of our hearts.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.220]   Because man looks on the outward appearance,
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.400]   but God looks at the heart.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.020]   He doesn't care simply that we do the right things,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.760]   he cares that we do them from the right reasons.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.680]   So what's the way that we should walk?
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.780]   We've heard the warning, the way you should walk
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.900]   is you should aim to be innocent at heart
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.020]   and not just impressive in life.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.420]   You should aim to be innocent at heart
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.100]   and not just impressive in life.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.940]   That's the first one.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.780]   How we doing, we doing okay?
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.180]   Chalking with me, here we go.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.500]   Verse 27, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.620]   "you hypocrites, for you are whitewashed tombs,
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.680]   "which outwardly appear beautiful,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.580]   "but within are full of dead people's bones
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.120]   "and all uncleanness.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.500]   "So you outwardly appear righteous to others,
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.900]   "but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.740]   So here's the thing, at first glance, this woe,
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.100]   it feels very similar to the last one, does it not?
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.860]   They feel very similar in nature,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.340]   and yet there is a major difference.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.660]   It's subtle, but it is there.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.640]   And here's the difference.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.700]   The first woe that we read tonight,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.700]   it's about doing the right things from the wrong heart.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.540]   This one is about doing the right things
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.740]   from no heart at all.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.140]   You see, Jesus is warning us to beware of those
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.200]   who teach dead religion over true grace.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.300]   Beware of those who teach dead religion over true grace.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.460]   Now, at the time that Jesus is speaking,
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.700]   contrary to popular belief, tombs were not whitewashed
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.000]   for the sole sake of beautifying them.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.380]   You see, that was a side effect
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.020]   of why they actually whitewashed them.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.420]   They would whitewash tombs
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.340]   because they wanted to make sure that as Israelites
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.600]   were traveling from foreign lands back to Jerusalem,
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.580]   they could make their way free of the danger
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.380]   of stepping on something that would make them unclean,
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.660]   namely a tomb or a gravesite.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.060]   And so they would whitewash them.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.100]   They would try to make sure, knowing full well
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.940]   that the consequence of being made unclean
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.220]   as someone's making their journey is so devastating
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.100]   that they could move towards Jerusalem
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.980]   and they could do so without fear
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.540]   of jeopardizing their journey.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.320]   You see, if you actually stepped on a grave,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.740]   if you actually engaged with a corpse,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.300]   it would make you for seven days unclean.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.660]   Now, for most other ritual impurities,
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.760]   they were pretty quick and easy ways
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.200]   to find yourself clean again.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.460]   But corpus impurity was the one that,
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.520]   it was kind of the granddaddy of defilement, if you will.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.820]   It was the one that was not so easily resolved.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.160]   And so if you and your little family
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.720]   making a journey from wherever you live
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.760]   all the way to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.600]   happen to be leading your kids and one of them
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.540]   peeled off the path and decided to touch a grave,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.280]   your entire journey would be fruitless.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.580]   It'd be in vain.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.420]   And so the Pharisees are like,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.840]   "Man, we've got to whitewash these things.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.660]   "We've got to paint them up in chalk.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.720]   "We've got to make them look like
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.580]   "the ancient Near Eastern of skunks."
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.360]   Which may feel weird to you.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.200]   Why a skunk?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.020]   Well, think about it.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.860]   What is a skunk?
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.360]   A skunk is a cute little animal
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.260]   with very stark colors that alert you
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.180]   to come nowhere near them.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.160]   That's why they look black and they look white.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.760]   Like they're alerting predators,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   "You don't want to mess with me.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.480]   "I may be snuggly, but I will defile you."
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.640]   That is what a whitewashed tomb is.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.900]   It looks beautiful,
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.240]   but you don't want to get anywhere close to it.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.860]   There's a lot of whitewashing in the church today.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.980]   Beautiful buildings, impressive programs,
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.660]   breathtaking visuals, massive ministries,
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.640]   but there's very little life change
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.980]   in those places at times.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.720]   Like many in the church,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.360]   they've grown to a place
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.600]   where they know a lot about ministry,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.720]   but they know little about God
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.680]   because they've gotten really good
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.220]   at playing the Christian game,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.460]   but they're actually not putting any points on the board.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.980]   There's actually no difference in their work.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.800]   And let me just say this.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.720]   I'm highly aware of the fact that I am standing on a stage
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:44.620]   in a place that is big and is beautiful and is branded.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.020]   And I am terrified by that reality.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.840]   I'm so nervous by the fact
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.820]   that we could casually show up here on Tuesdays
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.600]   and see all of our friends,
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.500]   and we could share a message to the crowd,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.600]   and we could sing some songs,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.620]   and we could sell some merch,
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.440]   and no real difference could actually be made.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.000]   That we could actually spend time in this room,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.840]   and we can do all manner of other things,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.860]   but we could miss the thing
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.460]   that actually matters the most, meeting with God.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.100]   Like I am not interested in being the weekly entertainment.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.820]   Like I don't want this to be a place of dead religion.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.580]   I don't wanna spend our time
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.620]   professionalizing in our ministry.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.540]   That would be a waste.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.780]   Like what I want to be true in this room
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.900]   is a radical redemptive movement
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.220]   where we meet with God.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.900]   He moves among us,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.380]   and we feel like our lives are forever changed.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.540]   Like we behold his beauty.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.020]   We become more like him.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.660]   We belong to his family,
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.900]   and we actually save the world.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.260]   That's what I want here.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.340]   And yet what we know is we can miss it
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.400]   if we get so swept up in dead religion.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.920]   I don't wanna live a whitewashed life.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.980]   I don't wanna lead a whitewashed ministry,
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.620]   and I don't want you to be whitewashed yourself.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.920]   Yeah, here's the thing.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.540]   We are so prone to doing it.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.580]   We quote our Bibles, we pray our prayers,
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.940]   we confess our sins, we show up to group,
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.940]   we give our money,
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.460]   and we're casual about it the entire time.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.180]   We think about our religious busyness,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.500]   and yet what we feel is apathy and indifference.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.340]   Let me just ask you.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.100]   Do you think God is casual about you in any way?
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.260]   Do you think that Jesus looks at you and says,
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.980]   yeah, you know what, casual Christianity.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.500]   That's actually something that I wanna reciprocate.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.100]   No, like he doesn't have a casual bone in his body
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.900]   when it comes to you.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.860]   He loves you.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.260]   He's wild about you.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.620]   Like he's not apathetic, man.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.740]   Should I spend some time with him today?
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.580]   I'm not real sure.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.860]   Yesterday was pretty tough.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.100]   He doesn't approach you like that.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.140]   He's not indifferent over whether or not
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.500]   you actually should spend some time
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.540]   and visit with one another.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.580]   You know what, I spoke to him from the Word yesterday,
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.820]   but he didn't really listen to me later that afternoon.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.820]   So should I do it again today?
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.660]   That's not his heart.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.500]   He's not indifferent.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.860]   He's not passively interested in you.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.900]   He's not passively interested in you.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.940]   He's passively interested in the circumstances of your life.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.260]   He's not casual about you.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.460]   He is enraptured by you.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.860]   So much so that God would send his own son to save you.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.380]   If you don't believe me, listen to Paul.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.100]   He says in Titus 2,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.380]   for the grace of God has appeared,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.020]   bringing salvation for all people,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.820]   training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.500]   and to live self-control and upright and godly lives
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.660]   in the present age,
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.980]   waiting for our blessed hope,
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.780]   the appearing of the glory of our great God
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.820]   and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.980]   who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.300]   and to purify himself a people for his own possession
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.980]   who are zealous for good works.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.340]   Jesus is not casual about you.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.780]   He is not casual about me.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.340]   He is not casual about these moments.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.180]   He cares deeply.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.320]   He's not interested in dead religion.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.260]   One pastor said it so well.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.500]   What are the differences between cemeteries and hospitals?
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.460]   One is peaceful and quiet and calm because it's dead.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.220]   But the other, it is messy and noisy and loud and chaotic.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.340]   Why? Because people are fighting for life.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.240]   That's what grace looks like.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.740]   Grace looks messy.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.860]   It looks wild at times.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.580]   Like grace, it looks like wrestling through your doubts,
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.060]   confessing your sins, singing even if you're off key,
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.660]   dancing, though that might be a little bit undignified,
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.160]   speaking up at the risk of people thinking you're nuts.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.760]   It's reading the Bible, even when you don't understand it.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.360]   It's loving those that do not deserve it.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.120]   And it's pursuing God,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.220]   not seeking to be perfect for other people.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.780]   That's what true Christianity sounds like.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.300]   True Christianity, it does not sound flawless.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.420]   It sounds faithful.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.280]   It sounds faithful.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.740]   God isn't interested in you being successful.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.800]   He wants you to be faithful.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.420]   He wants you to buy into the grace that he gives.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.380]   He's warned you, man, don't worry about dead religion.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.140]   Instead, the way you should walk
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.700]   is you should live by the grace I give,
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.800]   not die by the good you can do.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.500]   Last one, verses 29 through 32.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:24.880]   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.860]   for you build the tombs of the prophets
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.400]   and decorate the monuments of the righteous,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.640]   saying if we had lived in the days of our fathers,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.060]   we would not have taken part with them
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.960]   in shedding the blood of the prophets.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.660]   But you witness against yourselves
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.380]   that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.900]   Fill up then the measure of your fathers.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.200]   The last thing that Jesus warns us
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.140]   is we should beware of those who cast judgment
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.320]   instead of give mercy.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.100]   We should beware of those who cast judgment
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.260]   instead of give mercy.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.180]   There's a lot of irony in this last woe
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.440]   because Jesus calls out the Pharisees
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.020]   for their dishonesty in this moment.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.860]   Like they look at Jesus and they say,
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.220]   hey, we know what our fathers did.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.980]   They killed the prophets, but we're not like them.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.340]   Like, no, no, no, we're better, we're kinder, we're wiser.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.860]   We wouldn't do what they did.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   And yet Jesus is looking at them and saying,
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.100]   hey, you will not only do what they did,
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.800]   you will do it in a matter of a week's time
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.660]   because you will kill God's greatest prophet.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.940]   You will kill me.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.780]   He calls him out.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.180]   He lets him know.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.880]   You think you give mercy, but in fact, you give judgment.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.380]   When I was studying this, I remember thinking to myself,
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.460]   this is the hardest woe to identify within our regular world
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.780]   because we're not really interested in killing the prophets.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.300]   Like that's not something we actually do today.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.820]   But then I realized we do condemn one another.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.300]   In a similar way, we kill each other all the same.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.980]   We're quick to enthrone ourselves
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.180]   upon the opinions that we have formed
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.500]   rather than receive the mercy and extend it instead to people
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.160]   the way Jesus has given it to us.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.360]   You find this issue across the spectrum of spirituality.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.380]   You can find it amongst the most contemplative of camps.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.140]   Leaders who, man, on the surface,
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.300]   they advocate compelling theological positions
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.940]   and a fidelity to God's word and a scriptural precision
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.980]   that is really, really interesting.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.420]   And yet all the while, they passively scrutinize
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.820]   other people, they openly cast judgments
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.260]   upon those that disagree with their doctrinal distinctives.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.660]   But it's not just in the most contemplative of camps.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.980]   It's also in the most charismatic of camps.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.740]   Like you can find people who, man,
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.060]   they motivate your morality.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.820]   Like they stir up your spirit.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.060]   They fan into flame.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.060]   Like that spot fire of faith in your life.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.980]   Like they're so good at it and yet they are willing to do so
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.820]   at great compromise to the scripture.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.700]   Like they'll do what they can to emotionally motivate
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:08.300]   yet ultimately not bring about the kind of conviction
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.140]   God's spirit can do through his word and his word alone.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.420]   They are seeking to serve their own agenda
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.180]   and they're willing to manipulate people to get it done.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.840]   You can find it also in yourselves.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.360]   You see, we're really quick to honor God with our lips.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.840]   But in the same breath,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:35.560]   we also tend to criticize, convict, and condemn one another.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.920]   James, he says this himself.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   He says, "With the tongue, we praise our Lord and Father
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   "and with it we curse human beings."
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.460]   We curse one another.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.360]   "Those that have been made in God's likeness
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.420]   "out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.740]   "My brothers, my sisters, this shouldn't be so.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.660]   "I know this was a problem for me
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.200]   "for several years of my life."
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.560]   So I grew up in the church.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.640]   And yet it wasn't until I got to college
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.520]   that I really began to read the Bible.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.500]   Like I got some theological exposure.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.520]   And with that, as is often true,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.120]   I got some theological pride.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.580]   I thought that I knew better.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.060]   I was wiser.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.400]   I had more discernment than the rest of those
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.720]   that I had grown up alongside.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.980]   And so what I decided to do is I decided to part ways
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.880]   with that group.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.340]   They were pretty conservative.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.480]   They held fast to tradition.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.440]   And yet what I realized is I studied the Bibles.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.020]   Man, it feels like they're pretty inconclusively
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:38.980]   studying the scripture.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.380]   And so I judged them and I joined instead
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.940]   a charismatic group.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.300]   I spent time around that charismatic group
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   and I was so motivated by the way they lived their lives.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.980]   And yet over the course of time,
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.940]   I began to grow skeptical
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.860]   because they were more interested in the gifts
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.860]   of the spirit and not merely walking with Jesus.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.080]   And so I judged them and I decided to join
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.780]   a gospel saturated group.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.660]   A group that really revered the Bible,
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.460]   that spent time studying the scripture.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.100]   And yet what I realized as I sat in Bible study
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.500]   and I read through the text is that this group of people,
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.900]   though they were really well-meaning,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.300]   they were pretty theologically shallow.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.140]   They hadn't read Luther and Calvin and Spurgeon
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.500]   and Edwards and Owen the way that I had.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.740]   And so it was good for me to actually part ways with them,
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.580]   cast judgment, join instead a very intellectual group.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.100]   And as I spent time amongst this intellectual group,
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.580]   what I realized is, man, you guys are stimulating.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.740]   You guys are interesting,
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.580]   but you're actually pretty insular.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.940]   You're not very missiological.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.380]   You're not very interested in what's happening
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.220]   out in the world.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.300]   And so wouldn't you believe it?
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.980]   I judged them and you get it at this point, right?
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.740]   Like this was my story for a lot of my life.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.980]   This was my journey of faith
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.520]   during my early, early, early young adult years.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.900]   And though it was largely unknown to me at the time,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.340]   I was quick to criticize other people.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.380]   I was quick to condemn them.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.740]   And I was quick to cast them aside
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.240]   in the pursuit of God's truth.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.700]   Some of you have experienced that same thing.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   Some of you were that same person.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.340]   Others of you have sat on the other side
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.700]   of the table from that guy.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.540]   And you were judged for something you did.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:27.300]   You were silenced because that sin is just too much.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.020]   You were belittled because you were a bit different.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.580]   You didn't categorically fit
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.580]   into the regular Christian circles.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:41.340]   And you had to become individually censored
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.620]   or else people would think you're divisive
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.820]   to the rest of the body.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:52.700]   And you're here tonight.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.340]   And all you can think is I'm done.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.840]   I've had my fill.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.820]   I've seen what the church offers.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:07.020]   And I'm still wanting.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.620]   I'm unimpressed.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.100]   I'm disappointed.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.440]   I'm even actually betrayed.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:20.280]   If that's you, then listen to me.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:25.940]   Jesus has not condemned you for your mistakes.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.380]   So do not condemn him for the mistakes of his people.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:39.940]   Like some of you have walked into places like this
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.620]   and your experience was like my experience
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.300]   when I walked into my apartment that day.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.380]   All you saw were stains.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.500]   All you smelt was foul.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.980]   All you saw was broken.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.220]   And all you felt was distrust.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:59.060]   Jesus is not trying to sweep in and save you out of that.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.200]   He wants to come in and he wants to clean the stain.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.420]   He wants to purify the foulness.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.220]   Like he wants to wash away the grime.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.940]   He wants to mend your hurt.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.300]   He wants to rebuild your trust
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.540]   because while Jesus himself was church hurt,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.820]   he didn't respond by hurting the church.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.600]   He responded by saving her.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.700]   And the reason we know it is because Jesus,
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.480]   he never worried about his image in life.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.500]   Instead, he worried about our innocence.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:40.020]   So much so that he himself was religiously ridiculed.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.380]   You feel religiously ridiculed?
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.480]   Jesus was religiously ridiculed for the sake of you.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.940]   Jesus, he never taught dead religion.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.100]   No, he taught about a living grace
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.940]   that reaches out to the spiritually wounded
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.420]   through his wounds himself.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.420]   And Jesus, he never came to condemn.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.240]   Instead, he was condemned in our place.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:16.020]   Jesus wants to save his church.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.140]   He wants to save you too if you'll let him.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:25.200]   I don't know how deep the wounds may go,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.260]   but you need only look to his wounds and realize he can.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.780]   He can save you, he can do it,
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.740]   and he can bring you back home.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.500]   Let me pray for us.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.940]   God, we love you.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.060]   Thankful for tonight, grateful for a chance
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.660]   just to sit under your word and to feel God the weight of it.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.440]   Like I don't want us to shy away from the hard scriptures.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.660]   I don't want us to just preach pleasant platitudes.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.300]   God, I want us to look at those texts, those scriptures,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.240]   which really weigh God, not just on our circumstance,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.000]   but even our soul.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.940]   We feel that tonight.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:12.800]   God, there's some people in here
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   that have been just deeply hurt by your church,
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.340]   by religious leaders, by the spiritually significant,
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.020]   and God, they are all but ready to give up.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.820]   I pray they would know while you can relate,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.360]   to their pain, you cannot relate to that choice.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.400]   For you, Jesus, did not come to condemn your church,
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.040]   you came to save her.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.920]   So what do you say at the end of this passage?
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.840]   You say, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,"
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.240]   that you would know the things which make for peace today.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:56.180]   I pray, Jesus, that we would lament the pain we've felt
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.480]   and the poor representation it is of you,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.320]   but we would not give up, we would lean in.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.840]   And then, Jesus, I know there are people in this room
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.560]   that are religious leaders, that do the work of ministry,
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.640]   that faithfully follow and seek to serve your flock.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.800]   I pray that you would be near to them,
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.320]   that you would encourage them, that you would secure them,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.560]   that they wouldn't look to the watching world
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   to find their identity, but they would find it within you.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.880]   You're a good King, and it's to you now
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.280]   that we sing, in Christ's name, amen.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.580]   Hey, porch, let's stand together, if you will.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.800]   Hey, we've got a team down to the left, down to the right,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.720]   they would love to visit with you,
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.840]   if you need to process, if you need to pray,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.860]   maybe you've never talked about this stuff with anybody.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.120]   We'd love to begin the conversation with you tonight.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.060]   Others of you used to sing, you'd be faithful,
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.920]   need not be flawless, but God wants to meet with you tonight.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.200]   Let's not entertain empty religion,
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.920]   let's engage with what really matters,
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.020]   let's sing to Him now.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.600]   (gentle music)
