00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 All right, how we doing tonight, Porch?

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Come on.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Shout out to downtown, shout out to Houston, El Paso,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 the other locations from around the country that are tuning in

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 to be with us tonight for The Porch Live.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 My name's Daniel Crawford.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I lead our college ministry here at Watermark and work closely--

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 you're out there, that's cool--

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 work closely with the Porch team,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and so it is a joy to be with you guys tonight.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Generally speaking, I would describe myself as more of a lover than a fighter,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 but I did get in one fight one time.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It was during my very prolific high school football career.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We were sophomores.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The game ended in somewhat of a controversial manner,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and the other team had a problem with that.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The referees didn't have a problem, but the other team did,

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 and so as we're walking to the locker room,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I see our team and their team slowly start to converge on one another

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 until that first proverbial shot is fired, and then it's on, right?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And so I'm about two-thirds of the way back.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I'm kind of surveying the scene.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We're 16 years old, so some of us look 24.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Others of us look 12.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I'm post-puberty, 5'8", and so at this time I look like I'm 12,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 and I'm like 120 pounds soaking wet.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And so the survival instincts kick in, and you get one or two things, right?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You either fight or flight.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And so I don't love--I'm not crazy about either of those two options in that moment.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And so I'm figuring out what to do, and I decide I'm just going to kind of get in there

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and kind of start like shoving people around a little bit

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 and maybe grab somebody by the back of the pads.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 That's illegal, but the referees have no more power anymore,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 so I'm going to do some of that.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And so I do that, and I'm kind of letting gravity work, and things are going well.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I am gaining confidence.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 My confidence is becoming perhaps arrogance,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 and in my arrogance something starts to swell in me,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and I'm overcome with this desire.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And before I know it, I pop that helmet off, and I'm ready to go.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And then not three seconds later, I get popped in the mouth is what I get.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And so I look around to see who did it,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and then to my even further embarrassment, I realize I didn't even get punched.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Like my buddy who was wearing his helmet got shoved into me,

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 and it hit me in the mouth.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So I get to go to school the next day with a fat lip.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 The fight actually made the news, and so people knew what it was.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I totally said that I got into a fight,

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and you should see the other guy that he was in way worse condition than I was,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 which is not true.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But afterwards, as I just got to think by myself, I'm like,

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 "Man, why would I take my pads off?

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Like why would I remove my helmet?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Like the things that I just wore for an entire football game

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 that are scientifically engineered to protect me from harm,

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 when it's going down, I take it off.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 What was I thinking?"

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And I suffered for it.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And so as a man who has navigated his 20s

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 in close proximity to other people navigating their 20s,

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 here's what I know is that most of us in the room tonight

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 are kind of like me in that story,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 where we realize we're coming up against adversity in different ways.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It feels like we're in a fight,

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and we are trying to go to battle without any sort of armor whatsoever.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And we have suffered for it, and we will continue to suffer for it.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The challenge is that we don't realize what is causing our anxiety,

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 what is killing our relationships,

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 what is driving our addictive behaviors,

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and what is enslaving us to this sin in our life as we struggle.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 We don't realize that we are at war,

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 and that many of us are losing in this war

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 because we're not putting on the protective armor

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 that God has graciously provided for us.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 We're feeling beat up.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 We're feeling overwhelmed.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But it doesn't have to be that way.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And so my hope tonight is that we'll leave this room encouraged,

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 that we will continue in this series that David kicked off last week

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 that is called "The Unseen,"

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 and that specifically tonight,

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 as we're reminded that we have an unseen enemy,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 we're going to learn how to fight in this unseen war.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And so I'm going to reread real quick where David was,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 and then we're going to keep going.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But verses 10 through 12, this is in Ephesians chapter 6.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 If you have your Bible, you can turn there.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Verses 10 through 12 said this,

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 "Finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Put on the full armor of God

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 so that you may take your stand against the devil's evil schemes.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 but against the rulers, authorities, and powers of this dark world,

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And so we're going to pick up with verses 13 through 20.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And my hope is that tonight we're going to learn

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 how to fight in this unseen war.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Specifically, we're going to see three things.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 We're going to see that we're all a part of this unseen war.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 We're going to see that we must prepare for this unseen war.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And we're going to see that we must pray

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 in the midst of this unseen war.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Let's dive in.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Verse 13.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 "Therefore put on the full armor of God

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 so that when," not if, "when the day of evil comes,

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 that you may be able to stand your ground

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 and after that you have done everything to stand."

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So Paul is saying there is a war going on,

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 that our engagement in being affected by this war is inevitable,

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 and that it is not a given that we will stand,

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 that we are at risk of being knocked down.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So the first point tonight is that we are part of an unseen war.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And so when I even say that, like if you're like me,

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 it's almost like, man, that's almost kind of hard to believe.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Sounds a little like Lord of the Rings-ish,

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 like Hogwarts style.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 I did not attend Hogwarts.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I wish I would have attended Hogwarts.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I didn't go there.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But I think it's because of just like where we are.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Like being in America, we know that like the Republicans

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 and the Democrats don't seem to have very nice things to say

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 about each other.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 We know that there still remains some bad blood

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 between T. Swift and Katy Perry, apparently.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And so, and as far as real war goes,

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 like we're used to rumors of war,

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 like North Korea might fire a missile at us or somebody else.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 We're used to reports of war about what ISIS is up to

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 over in the Middle East, far, far away from here.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But it doesn't feel like we are actively engaged in real warfare.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So even just like, if you just think through

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 like the last seven days, what did I do in the last seven days?

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I went to work.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I went and worked out.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I went out with my boys.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I watched, caught up on a couple shows,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 stayed current with my social media feeds.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Like all of that feels routine and ordinary and mundane.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 None of that feels threatening or dangerous.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But I think the reality is that those things can be dangerous.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Clint Bruce is a member here at Watermark.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Clint also happens to be a Navy SEAL.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And so he also happens to now train Navy SEALs.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So this is something that Clint said.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I want you to listen to this.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He said, "To come home from war

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 "and believe that I was not at war anymore

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 "was very dangerous.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 "And so I needed to surround myself with people

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 "who understood that we were at war,

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 "and that this war is different,

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 "that there's no bullets or bombs,

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 "but there's temptation, there's alcohol,

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 "there's laziness, lust, materialism.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 "There's all of these other things

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 "that are as or more dangerous than a bullet."

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Close quote, Navy SEAL.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Physically, we are in the very prosperous,

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 very comfortable United States of America,

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 but the truth is that spiritually,

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Scripture would say that this is the Middle East.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 The threats of bombs and wars,

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 catastrophes and victims lies all around us all the time.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And when we think, when life seems most comfortable,

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 we might very well be at our most susceptible to attack.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so looking back at the last seven days,

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 looking forward to the next seven days,

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 you will go back to work,

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 but you will also be going to war.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 You're gonna be going to war with selfish ambition.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You're gonna be tempted to chase money and comfort,

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 power and prestige, moving up the corporate ladder,

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 materialism, careerism.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 You may choose to go out to the bars,

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 but you're also gonna have a battle waiting for you there.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 There's gonna be temptation.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Substance abuse, impaired judgment,

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and a morning after routine that consistently has guilt

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and has regret.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And what was I thinking and why did I do that again?

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You'll probably scroll through your social media

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and depending on who or what you follow,

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 my guess is that your feed may end up feeding your insecurities

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and that you're gonna get caught in the comparison trap.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 That it's gonna spark FOMO, that it's gonna spark jealousy,

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 that you're then gonna turn around

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 and try and illustrate how beautiful

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and how awesome your life is in return,

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 when in reality, you're miserable, you're lonely,

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 you want somebody else's life,

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 and you're putting on a front.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 That is a battle and it is taking victims.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So do not be deceived, friends.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 We are all part of an unseen war,

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 but God has not left the Christian unprotected and unarmed.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Let's keep reading.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Verse 14, "Stand firm then with the belt of truth

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "buckled around your waist,

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 "with the breastplate of righteousness in place

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 "and with your feet fitted with the readiness

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 "that comes from the gospel of peace.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 "In addition to all of this,

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 "take up the shield of faith

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 "with which you can extinguish

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 "all of the flaming arrows of the evil one.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 "Take the helmet of salvation

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 "and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Our second point tonight is that we must prepare

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 for this unseen war.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And so you may read that description

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 and it's like, dude, armor.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It's like, I've never been anywhere near armor.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I watched some Heath Ledger movies back in the day, I guess,

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 but like closest I've ever gotten to armor is under armor.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Right?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And that's because when we think of soldiers,

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 when we think of war, we think about a picture of Clint.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 We think about camouflage.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 We think about rifles, maybe some night vision goggles.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 But to the Ephesians back in the first century AD,

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 this is smack dab in the middle of the Roman empire.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And so this is what it would look like

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 when somebody was going to war.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And so Paul intentionally highlights,

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 he grabs and draws attention

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 to these different individual pieces of armor.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And I wanna unpack them together

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 because each piece I believe he chose strategically

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and they represent a piece of God's strength

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 that he offers to believers

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 as we live out our faith in Christ.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 The other thing I want us to notice,

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 and I think this is really important.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 This gripped me as I studied this text this week,

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 is that he's writing to Christians, right?

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 This is a church in Ephesus and he says,

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "Put on the armor of God,"

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 which that would imply that even if we're believers,

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 we're not popping out of bed in the morning

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 ready to go to war.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We got to put on these different pieces of armor

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 so you could really do a sermon on each one.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I'm gonna go quickly through them.

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And so I would encourage you to dig into that later.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 But first we got the belt of truth.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And so I know what you're thinking.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It's like, that's pretty straightforward.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I got a belt and that's the truth.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 It's right there, Calvin Klein.

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And these belts were like thick leather.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Like they really tied the entire suit of armor together.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Several of the other pieces would connect to the belt.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It was the centerpiece of armor for battle.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And so he starts with the belt

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 and he says that it represents the truth.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 The truth holds everything together.

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 There is absolute truth.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And it is absolutely critical that we know the truth

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 and that we wrap our lives in it before we do anything else.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So we'll look into that a little bit more

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 when we get to the sword.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I'm gonna keep moving.

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Next is the breastplate of righteousness.

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 A typical soldier would have this chest plate

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 made out of bronze or some sort of a thick metal.

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And that's pretty straightforward.

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It was to guard and to protect the vital organs,

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 most vital of which was guarding the heart.

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And so Paul says that our breastplate

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 in the Christian life is righteousness.

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 That we are to put on righteousness

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 and protect our hearts with it.

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And so Proverbs, Solomon was a king

278
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 way back in the day in Israel.

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 He wrote the Proverbs,

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 a lot of good nuggets of wisdom in there.

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And he literally out of all of it, he says,

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 "Hey boys, listen, come here.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 "If you're gonna remember one thing I say

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 "and forget all of this other gold, listen to this."

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Proverbs 4.23 says, "Guard your heart above all else

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 "for it determines the course of your life."

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Okay, so guard my heart, put on righteousness.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Cool, how do I do that?

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 What does that look like tangibly?

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And to put it really simply,

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 here's how I think you know that you are guarding your heart.

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You are guarding your heart if you are really, really picky

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 about what you let in to your life.

294
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And so this may be your story.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 This may be what putting on the breastplate

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 of righteousness looks like for you is,

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 man, I had to stop watching "The Bachelorette"

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 because I'd find myself planning 17 weddings in my head

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 after the second date.

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And I just made the decision instead,

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 man, I'm just gonna pray for my future spouse

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 if the Lord would have me have a future spouse.

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And that's what I need to do.

304
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That's me putting on the breastplate.

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Man, I had to drop "The Game of Thrones"

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 even though it's like the best thing going

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 because I could not get the images out of my head.

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And I talked with community

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 and I just decided it had to be a hard and fast thing.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 If there are topless women involved, I'm out on it

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 'cause I struggle with that.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 That's gonna drive me in other ways

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 that I don't want to be driven.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You may think he's straight up killing the game right now,

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 but I know more Drake verses than I know Bible verses.

316
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And these are two very different views on life

317
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 and what the good life looks like, right?

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 There's very different counsel on good living

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 from those two sources.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And so you're not wicked if you bump Drake

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and hop in your car right after this,

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 but you may not be able to do that, may not be helpful.

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Here's a personal one for me is with fantasy sports,

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 guys, listen, I would spend more time preparing

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 for my draft than my job.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 All right, this is before I worked here, don't judge me.

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 But I'd spend more time like work in my roster

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 than talking to my wife.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And just like, think about that,

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 like a fictitious sports matchup

331
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 with one of my idiot friends

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 consumed more heart capacity that week than my bride did.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And that's crazy to me.

334
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 So I can't play fantasy football anymore,

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 which kills me 'cause I love it.

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 When we put on the breastplate,

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 we don't follow the longings of our heart,

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 we inform our hearts.

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 We are very, very careful about what we consume

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 in the pursuit of righteousness.

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Next, he talks about putting on shoes

342
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 that are ready with the gospel of peace.

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 A soldier's battle shoes would have like nails

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 or studs in the bottom, think cleats, think gospel cleats.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And so those would help you dig in, keep your balance,

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 keep you from getting pushed backwards

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 and help you drive forward into enemy territory.

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And so he says that these cleats represent

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 the message of the gospel,

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 that the beauty of the gospel message

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 puts you in a ready position so that you are secure

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 because you're resting in your identity in Christ

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 and not your own performance and not your own works.

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 You are firmly planted in him.

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Remembering who you were apart from Christ.

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Remembering how he reached down and pursued you

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 and saved you and how life has been so much different

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 and so much sweeter since then.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 When I preach the gospel to myself every day

360
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 that we just sang in those songs,

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 nothing keeps me grounded like that.

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Next, he says the shield of faith.

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Don't think Captain America, red, white, and blue,

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Frisbee disc, cool thing, right?

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Roman shields, these things were massive.

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 They were like car doors that you could literally hide behind

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 and it would cover you.

368
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It would be a full on protective blanket

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and it was the primary barrier between you

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 and the attacks of the enemy.

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 As he had said, the flaming arrows of the evil one.

372
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That was a popular military tactic back then.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So he says the shield that blocks those fiery arrows

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 represents our faith.

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 That like a shield, our faith is a protective barrier

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 between us and the enemy's attacks.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Simply put, faith, it's like, how would you,

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I've heard that, how would you even define that?

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Here's, I would just strip it down to this.

380
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Faith is just believing who God is,

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 that he is who he says he is

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 and that he's going to do what he said he's going to do.

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 That he's good, that he loves you, that he cares,

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 that he only gives good gifts,

385
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 that he does not make mistakes.

386
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 That is a mighty shield

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 that we have the opportunity to hide behind.

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Without it, we've seen the devastation that it causes.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 We have these stories either personally

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 or in people close to us.

391
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 We have that person who got that diagnosis, right?

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Mom got cancer, got less than a year to live.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Cousin goes off to college,

394
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 starts being around professors that say

395
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Christianity is a joke, that the Bible is stupid,

396
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 picks apart their faith.

397
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 They come back, they're an atheist.

398
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Their faith is crumbled.

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 They did not have the shield of faith.

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Essentially it revealed, and this is where it's so scary,

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 it can reveal an if-then kind of faith.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 If this happens, then I'll believe.

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 If this doesn't happen, I'm out.

404
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 So without the shield,

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 we're at risk of having an if-then faith

406
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 and being taken out.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But hopefully you've also seen people

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 that have stood their ground

409
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 against the attacks of the enemy.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 That friend who, like man,

411
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 she lost her job and got dumped in the same week.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And it's like, God, she's sad.

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 She's okay.

414
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 She's processing, she's like,

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 "Lord, I'm insecure.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "I'm embarrassed that I got fired.

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 "I thought I was gonna marry that guy.

418
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 "Will I be single forever now?

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "And yet I know that your plans are better than mine.

420
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 "I can trust you when it's hard to trace your hand.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 "I know that I can trust your heart."

422
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 You have, rather than an if-then faith,

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 an even-if faith,

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 which says, "Even if fill in the blank,

425
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 "I will stand behind this shield of faith.

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 "I will trust that God is good.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 "I will look back on his perfect track record

428
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 "of faithfulness through the years.

429
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "In the midst of seasons where I doubted his goodness,

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "I can see now he was there.

431
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 "He is with me, he is for me, he loves me."

432
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Next, the helmet of salvation.

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Everybody knows that the one guaranteed kill shot

434
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 is the headshot, right?

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 That's gonna take you out faster than anything.

436
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And so the helmet is perhaps the most important piece

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 of armor, and Paul says that the helmet

438
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 represents our salvation.

439
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And so in reading this again,

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I found it fitting that we talked about

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 the cleats being the gospel message

442
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and the helmet being our salvation by grace through faith.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's as if they're saying from head to toe,

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 you need to clothe yourself and protect yourself

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 with the message of the gospel,

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 not about what you do to work yourself

447
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 or become good enough for God or to get to heaven,

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 but about what he has done,

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 how he has showed his faithfulness

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 and his love for you on the cross

451
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 and said, "It is finished."

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And now for any person who would by grace through faith

453
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 turn from their sin and turn to God,

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 there is forgiveness and there is salvation.

455
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 This is good news.

456
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Let's put on our helmets and with it, let's have assurance.

457
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And finally, the sword of the Spirit,

458
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 which he says is the word of God.

459
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 We know what a sword is,

460
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I don't have to describe that to you.

461
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 What I do want us to see is it is the only offensive weapon

462
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 that was listed.

463
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Did you notice that?

464
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 All of these other pieces of armor are defensive in nature.

465
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 The sword is the piece where we counterattack

466
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 and where we strike back.

467
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And he tells us that the sword,

468
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 our only weapon is the scriptures.

469
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Listen, this is why we read the Bible.

470
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You don't read the Bible to check a box.

471
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 You don't read the Bible to seem holy

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and tell people that you did.

473
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You don't read the Bible to become a smarter sinner.

474
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 You don't read the Bible to please God.

475
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 He doesn't love you more when you do or when you don't.

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 He just knows that when you don't,

477
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 you're going to war without a weapon.

478
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The sword of the Spirit that is the word of God.

479
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 This is exactly what Jesus did himself

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 when he faced his greatest temptation.

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 In Matthew 4, you should go look it up and read it.

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He faces off with Satan.

483
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Three times Satan comes at him

484
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 with great promises and temptation.

485
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Three times Jesus replies, Bible verse, Bible verse,

486
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Bible verse.

487
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 He knew scripture.

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 He wrote it on his heart.

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He articulated it in the moment

490
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and he counterattacked when he was enduring temptation.

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 So if you want to experience victory,

492
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 which I know that we all, if there's one thing I know,

493
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 it's that we want to experience victory

494
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 from temptation and from sin

495
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 and from being enslaved to our struggles.

496
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 So if you want victory over that struggle with body image

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 and that eating disorder, you gotta know,

498
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I am fearfully, wonderfully made in the image of God.

499
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Psalm 139.

500
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 If you want victory over that porn struggle,

501
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 that really is a daily habit,

502
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 you gotta know 2 Timothy 2,

503
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 flee from sexual immorality and pursue righteousness.

504
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 You gotta do that in those moments of temptation.

505
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 If you're feeling cursed, I'm 29 and single.

506
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What's up with that?

507
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You gotta know Matthew 7.

508
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 God only gives good gifts to his children.

509
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 In Romans 8, he is working all things together

510
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 for his glory and our good.

511
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 That is not a curse.

512
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 If you're wondering, do I take him back again,

513
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 even though he kind of says that he's a Christian

514
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and yet he's constantly putting us in situations

515
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 where we're failing in sexual sin,

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I would say that's not a good idea.

517
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I would say do not be unequally yoked.

518
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 2 Corinthians 6.

519
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 As we have seen, we are all part of an unseen war

520
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 that we must equip ourselves and prepare

521
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 to stand in the battle.

522
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 We have been given protection, we've been given a weapon

523
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 and we have one more resource at our disposal

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 that is absolutely critical.

525
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 So verse 18, before we finish up,

526
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 "And pray in the spirit on all occasions

527
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 with all kinds of prayers and requests.

528
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 With this in mind, be alert,

529
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.

530
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Pray also for me that whenever I speak,

531
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known

532
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 the mystery of the gospel

533
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 for which I am an ambassador in chains.

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Pray that I may declare it fearlessly as I should."

535
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 A third and final point is that we must pray

536
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 in this unseen war.

537
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 We must pray in this unseen war.

538
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Verse 18, it says, "Pray in the spirit."

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And so just real quick, how do I pray in the spirit?

540
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 What does that mean?

541
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I'll just say there is no evidence

542
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 that that indicates some sort of a prayer language,

543
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 some sort of an angelic language that's not English.

544
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 There's no evidence that that's what that means.

545
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I believe that praying in the spirit,

546
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 if you wanna pray in the spirit, do this.

547
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Pray for God's will,

548
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 which is always consistent with God's word.

549
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Pray for God's will,

550
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 which is always consistent with God's word.

551
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Because here's what we're doing.

552
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Here's why this is so important,

553
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 is that what we're doing when we come before the creator

554
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 in the heavens of the earth, we're saying, "You are that.

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I am not the God of my own universe."

556
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 It is a posture of humility.

557
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It is a posture of dependence.

558
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 There is an unavoidable connection

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 between prayer and dependence, and it is paramount.

560
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Because here's the truth, this whole spiritual war,

561
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 this whole thing that we're talking about, it's not hard.

562
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 This spiritual war, it's not difficult.

563
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 It's impossible.

564
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 It is impossible without God

565
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and without being fully dependent on the Lord

566
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 to strengthen us, to provide for us.

567
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 We need him every hour of every day.

568
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 We need him.

569
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 John Piper said it like this.

570
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 "Prayer is not a domestic intercom."

571
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 This is so good.

572
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 "Prayer is not a domestic intercom

573
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 where we can call up the butler and order room service

574
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and get the thermostat adjusted.

575
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Prayer is a wartime walkie-talkie."

576
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 We are all at war.

577
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 We have been given a mission,

578
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 and we have access to the God of angel armies.

579
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 How crazy is that?

580
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That we can pray to him and that he cares

581
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 and that he listens and that he wants to help us,

582
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 that he wants to equip us.

583
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So here's what this allows us to do.

584
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 You can say, "God, I am struggling again

585
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 with comparison and with body image.

586
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Will you help me remember

587
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 that I am fearlessly, wonderfully made?

588
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 God, I'm struggling again.

589
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Pornography is eating me alive.

590
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Will you help me to flee from sexual immorality

591
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 and to pursue your righteousness instead?

592
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Father, singleness is stealing my joy again every week.

593
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Will you help me trust that you are at work in all things,

594
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 that you only give good gifts,

595
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 that your plans are better than my plans,

596
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 that you don't make mistakes,

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 that your timing is perfect, that I can trust you?"

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And honestly, this is a big one for me.

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Fear of man.

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Galatians 1 would say, "Am I trying to please man

601
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 or am I trying to please God?"

602
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And just to be really vulnerable with you,

603
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 as I prepared to be with you guys this week,

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 one thing that the enemy was throwing at me

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 over and over and over again,

606
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 thoughts that occurred over and over and over again is,

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 "I wonder what these people are gonna think about me.

608
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I wonder what, when they get in their cars

609
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 to drive home with their friends,

610
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I wonder what they're gonna say about Daniel Crawford."

611
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And as I thought about that more, "Are they gonna like me?

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Are they gonna think I'm funny?

613
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Are they gonna think I'm awful?"

614
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 That started to mess with me so bad.

615
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And then that's when people came alongside me

616
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 with the word of God that just says,

617
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 "Hey, the only thing you got, bro,

618
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 the only thing you've got is the word of God.

619
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The only thing you can do on the front side

620
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 is to pray for this message,

621
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 that the Spirit would show up,

622
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 that His truth would come through loud and clear."

623
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And so here's what I hope tonight.

624
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I hope that you remember what I've said,

625
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 and I hope that you forget that I ever said it,

626
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 and that it's as if I was never even here.

627
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 So to close, we are all part of an unseen war.

628
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We must prepare for this unseen war

629
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 and that we must pray in this unseen war.

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So it's the end of August.

631
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Fall is almost here.

632
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Fall is perhaps my favorite season for a few reasons.

633
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 One is that it's slowly not gonna be 150 degrees anymore.

634
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 The other is that another school year fires up,

635
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and with another school year comes

636
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 another football season, am I right?

637
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Got college game days.

638
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Get to see the Aggies go 6-0,

639
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 and then totally drop four out of the next five.

640
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Crush my soul year after year.

641
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Right now everybody's undefeated, right?

642
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And so a lot of things could happen.

643
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 We don't know what could happen,

644
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 but here's what I would probably say.

645
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I would guarantee I'd put money on this.

646
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Won't happen.

647
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And if it does, it'll go viral,

648
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 is that you won't see a quarterback

649
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 jogging out onto the field to go get under center

650
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 without being completely protected in full pads.

651
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Like if you don't have cleats,

652
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 you're gonna lose your footing, slip around,

653
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 maybe get stepped on by another cleat.

654
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 If you don't have shoulder pads, hello cracked ribs,

655
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 hello broken collarbones.

656
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 You get sent to the side,

657
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 like if your helmet even comes off accidentally,

658
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 you like get sent to timeout,

659
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 you have to sit out for a play,

660
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 like that's a big deal, nobody would do that.

661
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 There probably won't be any swords, and that's okay,

662
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 and so that's where the illustration

663
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 breaks down a little bit.

664
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 But you get the point, which is this,

665
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 that football armor has been literally

666
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 scientifically manufactured and engineered

667
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 to protect those athletes,

668
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and that it is a full set, it is a package deal.

669
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 To go out with some of it, but not all of it,

670
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 is not wise, and it leaves you vulnerable,

671
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and it leaves you susceptible to attack.

672
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 So my prayer for us is that we would wrap

673
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 our lives in the belt of truth.

674
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 That you would guard your heart

675
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 with the breastplate of righteousness,

676
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 that you would plant your feet into the ground

677
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 with the message of the gospel of grace.

678
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 You would reject the lies of the evil one

679
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 with the shield of faith,

680
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 that you would feel completely secure

681
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 as you wear the helmet of salvation.

682
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 That you would fight back with the sword of the spirit,

683
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 which is the word of God,

684
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 and that you would constantly use prayer

685
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 as your wartime walkie talkie.

686
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Let me do that for us now

687
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 as we go to war together this week.

688
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Father, we just confess our brokenness,

689
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Lord, we confess our need for you.

690
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 We confess that we are prone to wander,

691
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,240
 to wander, that we are prone to go to war on our own strength, not depending on yours,

692
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:08,040
 and that it does not go well with us. God, I pray that we would be a people marked by humility,

693
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,920
 marked by dependence, marked by prayer, marked by those who would put on the full armor of God,

694
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,920
 that you love us, that you are with us, that you care, that you are good,

695
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,320
 that you are who you say you are, that you will do what you said you are going to do,

696
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,920
 and that you can be trusted. We pray all that in Christ's perfect name, amen.
