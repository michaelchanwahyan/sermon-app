1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,500
 - You have seven unheard messages.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,160
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,240
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,680
 - Hey yo, Danny!

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,400
 Where you at, bro?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
 I'll see you soon, all right?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,320
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,680
 but I feel like the word keeps putting you back

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,920
 on my heart for a reason.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
 So please call me back.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,960
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,280
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,760
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,960
 - No, I'm sure this is the right number,

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,880
 but last night was a mistake.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,800
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,560
 and we need to talk.

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,080
 - It's great to see you.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,560
 Welcome, like I don't know if you've been tracking with us

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
 over the course of this summer, through this series,

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,280
 or maybe this is your first time in the room,

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,720
 but we're so grateful that you would choose

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,080
 to be with us here this Tuesday night.

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,840
 Not just those of you in the room, though you look great,

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,200
 but everybody that is in the chapel right now,

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
 special shout out to you guys.

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,280
 We're so glad that you didn't let the space constraints

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,120
 keep you away.

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,040
 You still made the effort to get in the room.

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,680
 And then also those that are in the loft,

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,080
 we've opened up another space because, you know,

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,520
 the people are coming and we're grateful to provide a seat

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
 and read the word of God together.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
 You know, we're really excited for where we're going tonight

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 because we are continuing the series, which has been awesome.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,720
 If you haven't been with us, then don't worry.

42
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,840
 You're not gonna, you're gonna be able to catch up

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
 to speed really quickly.

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,640
 But I'm also really excited because tonight

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 we have a very special guest in the room.

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
 You see here at the porch, we're really careful

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
 about the people who we put on the stage

48
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,000
 because we want to do a really good job

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,080
 of rightly dividing the word of truth for you.

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,040
 We believe that the gospel is too important.

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,800
 So we want to put people here that we deeply,

52
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
 deeply trust.

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
 And tonight we have someone that we definitely trust.

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,400
 He's been here before, but if you've never heard him speak,

55
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
 then you are in for a treat.

56
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,560
 He is the voice of the most spiritually formative years

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
 of my life.

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
 When I was in college, I had the benefit of sitting

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,640
 in seats just like yours and listen to him

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,240
 unpack the beauties of the gospel,

61
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,600
 really teach about the unified story

62
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
 that was pointing to the person of Jesus.

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,920
 And he is a formative voice for me today.

64
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,360
 And I'm so grateful that you're gonna get to hear from him.

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,960
 Porch, do an amazing job and help me welcome our friend,

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
 Ben Stewart to the stage.

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 (audience cheering)

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,800
 - All right, howdy!

69
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,520
 Hey, it's good to see, oh, okay, that's fun, all right.

70
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,360
 Hey, it is so good to be here for a number of reasons.

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,440
 I'm excited about what we're gonna look at today

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
 in God's word, but I just need to let y'all know

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
 that I am a huge fan of the pastor of this church,

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,200
 T.A. and his wife, Kat, who are over here.

75
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,800
 And I am a huge, yeah, that's, yeah,

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,100
 you can celebrate them if you weren't certain.

77
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,480
 You can, it's okay, we can talk.

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,840
 Just felt like we all weren't sure.

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
 It's a dance, we're learning.

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,200
 And I'm a huge fan of Kylan and his wife, Brooke, too,

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,040
 who you just saw on stage right here.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,280
 Let me tell you why I'm a fan, particularly these two men,

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,180
 why I'm a fan of them.

84
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,920
 I've had the privilege of knowing them for a very long time,

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
 and I've watched both of them go through difficult seasons,

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
 be handed challenging things,

87
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 be put in the crucible of suffering by God.

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
 And I've watched both of those men navigate it

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,520
 with humility and with grace.

90
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
 And I've had the privilege of watching God

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,440
 carve character into those guys.

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,000
 And so to see them on this stage

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,060
 and to see them stewarding this church,

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,840
 stewarding this movement of you,

95
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,040
 watching these two men do this,

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,560
 it honestly makes me excited for you

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,480
 because I know God's formed those men in the secret places

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
 so he could put them up in front of you and say,

99
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,140
 "Follow them as you follow Christ."

100
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,160
 And so I've just been excited all day

101
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,480
 because I just love these guys a lot.

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
 I love their families a lot.

103
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,240
 I love what God's done in their life.

104
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,800
 I like what he's doing through them.

105
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,200
 And you're welcome, Dallas, from God.

106
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 I didn't do it, but just that God's given you

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 some amazing leaders.

108
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
 So can we honor these guys and ladies too?

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,060
 Just very excited.

110
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,880
 (congregation applauding)

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,920
 All right, if you have a copy of your scriptures,

112
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,080
 we're gonna be in Genesis chapter 24.

113
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,720
 And I'm gonna read to you several verses of Genesis 24,

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
 just to load it in our minds, I'll pray,

115
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,860
 and then we'll talk about it together.

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,620
 So Genesis chapter 24, I'm gonna start reading in verse one.

117
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,320
 If you don't have a copy of your Bible, it's fine.

118
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
 I'm gonna read it out loud.

119
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
 So just listen and we'll make it.

120
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,380
 So Genesis 24, starting in verse one, says this.

121
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,840
 "Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years,

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,760
 "and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.

123
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
 "And Abraham said to his servant,

124
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,120
 "the oldest of his household,

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
 "who had charge of all that he had,

126
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,240
 "put your hand under my thigh,

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,100
 "that I may make you swear by the Lord,

128
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,800
 "the God of heaven and the God of earth,

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,400
 "that you will not take a wife from my son

130
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
 "from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,960
 "But you will go to my country and to my kindred

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,160
 "and take a wife from my son, Isaac.

133
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
 "The servant said to him,

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,380
 "perhaps a woman may not be willing to follow me

135
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,280
 "to this land.

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,600
 "Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?

137
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
 "And Abraham said to it,

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 "see to it that you do not take my son back there.

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,180
 "The Lord, the God of heaven,

140
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,880
 "who took me from my father's house

141
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,520
 "and from the land of my kindred,

142
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,460
 "who spoke to me and swore to me,

143
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,380
 "to your offspring I will give this land.

144
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,280
 "He will send his angel before you

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,060
 "and you shall take a wife from my son from there.

146
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,980
 "But if the woman's not willing to follow you,

147
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,740
 "then you will be free from this oath of mine.

148
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,120
 "Only you must not take my son back there.

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,100
 "So the servant put his hand

150
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,800
 "under the thigh of Abraham, his master,

151
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
 "and swore to him concerning this matter.

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,180
 "Then the servant took 10 of his master's camels

153
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,460
 "and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts

154
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,300
 "from his master.

155
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,200
 "And he arose and went to Mesopotamia,

156
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,120
 "to the city of Nahor.

157
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,380
 "And he made the camels kneel down outside the city

158
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,780
 "by the well of water at the time of evening."

159
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,260
 The time when women go out to draw water.

160
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,500
 "And he said, 'O Lord, God of my master Abraham,

161
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,460
 "'please grant me success today

162
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,080
 "'and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.

163
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
 "'Behold, I am standing by the spring of water

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
 "'and the daughters of the men of the city

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
 "'are coming to draw water.

166
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,660
 "'Let the young woman to whom I shall say,

 "'And who shall say, drink,

 "And before he had finished speaking,

 "behold, Rebecca, who was born of Bethuel,

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,420
 "the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,

177
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,040
 "came out with her water jar on her shoulder.

178
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,500
 "The young woman was very attractive in appearance,

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,680
 "a maiden whom no man had known.

180
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
 "And she went down to the spring

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,700
 "and filled her jar and came up.

182
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,440
 "Then the servant ran to meet her and he said,

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,320
 "'Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.'

184
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,940
 "And she said, 'Drink, my lord.'

185
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,000
 "She quickly let down her jar upon her hand

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,340
 "and gave him a drink.

187
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,760
 "And when she had finished giving him a drink,

188
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
 "she said, 'I will draw water for your camels also,'

189
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,840
 "until they finished drinking.

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,900
 "So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough

191
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,680
 "and ran again to the well to draw water,

192
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,860
 "and she drew for all his camels.

193
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,720
 "And the man gazed at her in silence

194
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,780
 "to learn whether the lord had prospered his journey or not.

195
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,080
 "And when the camels had finished drinking,

196
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,980
 "the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel

197
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,680
 "and two bracelets for her arms weighing 10 gold shekels

198
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,280
 "and said, 'Please tell me whose daughter you are.

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,760
 "'Is there room in your father's house

200
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,440
 "'for us to spend the night?'

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,580
 "And she said to him, 'I'm the daughter of Bethuel,

202
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,500
 "'the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.'

203
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,980
 "She said, 'We have plenty of both straw and fodder

204
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,940
 "'and room to spend the night.'

205
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,200
 "And the man bowed his head and worshipped the lord

206
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,420
 "and said, 'Blessed be the lord,

207
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,100
 "'the God of my master Abraham,

208
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,340
 "'who has not forsaken his steadfast love

209
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,380
 "'and his faithfulness towards my master.

210
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,180
 "'As for me, the lord has led me

211
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,140
 "'in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.'

212
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,260
 "Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household

213
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,460
 "about these things."

214
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,700
 Well, Lord, I pray for us now and say, by your grace,

215
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,160
 would you help us understand what is happening

216
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,960
 in this passage and what it means for us right now

217
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,640
 in these days in Dallas.

218
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 God, I pray that you would open our minds to understand it

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,680
 and you'd move our hearts to care about

220
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,780
 what you care about.

221
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,100
 We sang some bold things, God,

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,820
 about revival coming to this city.

223
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,380
 Lord, I pray it would start right here

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,580
 and start within individual hearts tonight.

225
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,020
 And I just wanna invite you, family,

226
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,340
 if you're willing, for you to take a minute

227
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,300
 and pray and ask him, say, "Lord, please teach me tonight."

228
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:05,340
 And then if you would, please pray for me,

229
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,980
 that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.

230
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
 (silence)

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,200
 Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.

232
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,880
 Use this time and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.

233
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,080
 Well, one time when I was in college at Texas A&M,

234
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,680
 farmer's fight, he can go,

235
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,820
 on a spring break, some buddies of mine and I

236
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,480
 decided to go down to San Miguel de Allende,

237
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,560
 which is a little town about an hour north of Mexico City.

238
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,200
 And so we jumped on a bus in Nuevo Laredo

239
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,620
 and rode through the night through Mexico

240
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,380
 and then woke up as the sun rose

241
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,260
 on this little artist colony town.

242
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,460
 And I remember one of our first nights there,

243
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,580
 we got up on the roof of La Perroquia,

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,220
 this massive neo-Gothic cathedral

245
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,260
 that kind of dominates this city.

246
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,060
 And we were sitting on the roof of this beautiful cathedral

247
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,940
 watching the sun set and a men's choir

248
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,900
 was down in like the cavernous hallways of this church.

249
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
 They began to sing hymns in Latin.

250
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,680
 And I remember that moment because it stood out

251
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,920
 as a first for me that in that moment

252
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,360
 and this beautiful building as the sun was setting

253
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
 over this brightly colored town,

254
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,120
 listening to this music waft up,

255
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,120
 I was overcome with so much beauty, it made my heartache.

256
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,200
 And I felt that in a moment

257
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
 and I remember the thought springing to my mind,

258
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,880
 I wish I had someone to share this with.

259
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,240
 And then I looked over at my buddy Ricardo

260
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,900
 and I thought, that's not what I meant.

261
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,060
 Ricky's a good dude, but I was feeling romantic.

262
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,620
 And that was new for me 'cause I didn't always feel that way.

263
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,340
 I didn't assume God would give me a wife

264
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,420
 or I'd get married.

265
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,260
 And yet in that moment, I just felt this,

266
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,020
 man, I wanna be with someone.

267
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,260
 I wanna share this life with somebody.

268
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,380
 And let me tell you something,

269
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,140
 that desire and that longing, it's good.

270
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,580
 It's a holy thing.

271
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,360
 It's a Genesis two thing.

272
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,980
 As God was creating humanity, Adam saw around

273
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,300
 and the first not good from God was Adam alone.

274
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,180
 It was cool to hang with the moose and the monkeys,

275
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,700
 but he wanted someone like him,

276
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,540
 a co-heir in the grace of life.

277
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,340
 And so when he saw Eve, he said, at last,

278
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,520
 finally, this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.

279
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,180
 This is one like me that I can journey with

280
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,300
 through the complexities of life.

281
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,020
 That desire to pair off is good.

282
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,440
 And I remember for me that next morning,

283
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,140
 I woke up and as I walked through the marketplace

284
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,580
 of that city, I saw a lithograph by Gustav Dore.

285
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,740
 It was a picture of a young man

286
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,180
 helping a woman down from a camel.

287
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,980
 And at the bottom of it, it said,

288
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,020
 Isaac, recibe a Rebecca.

289
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,820
 And so I accessed my two semesters of high school Spanish.

290
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,900
 [audience laughing]

291
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,140
 And I said, I know what that says.

292
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,800
 That says, Isaac receives Rebecca.

293
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,340
 And God was giving me a vision, I think in that day,

294
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,540
 of what is the longest chapter in the book of Genesis.

295
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,420
 God showing us the desire to pair off is good

296
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,260
 and then showing us how to do it, right?

297
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,740
 But let me say this, it has gotten complicated.

298
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,500
 And Kylan's been speaking to that.

299
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,140
 It's complicated to pair off in the modern world.

300
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,940
 Our church in Washington, DC,

301
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,760
 two thirds of our church are under the age of 30.

302
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,060
 Two thirds of our church are single.

303
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,980
 So I watched the difficulties and the longings

304
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,980
 and the complications every single day.

305
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,660
 And there's reasons for this.

306
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,040
 And we could go into all the reasons

307
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,700
 why dating and pairing off and marrying

308
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,140
 has gotten more complicated.

309
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,420
 You've talked about many of them.

310
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,900
 The technological changes during your lifetime

311
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,580
 have made it more difficult.

312
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
 And we've seen the data, it's in.

313
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,980
 More technology has led to less time

314
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,260
 hanging out with friends.

315
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,700
 Less time hanging out with friends

316
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,220
 led to less social interactions,

317
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,380
 less dates, less marriages, less kids.

318
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,020
 And now we have declining birth rates

319
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,180
 in nations all around the world.

320
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,980
 We could talk about the philosophical changes.

321
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,340
 That there are books coming out now from secular authors

322
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,220
 saying the sexual revolution of the '60s and '70s

323
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,240
 that was meant to liberate sexuality

324
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,460
 from the bonds of marriage

325
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,700
 has not liberated women and made them happy.

326
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,340
 It's made them miserable and feeling trapped.

327
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,740
 That some philosophical lies in the culture

328
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,420
 that have landed on your generation

329
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,580
 have hurt you, not helped you.

330
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,480
 And so we could talk about all the problems

331
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,940
 that have made it so hard for us to pair off,

332
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,660
 do this thing we desire to do.

333
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,260
 But if I spent all my time doing that,

334
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,100
 we wouldn't get to a solution.

335
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,940
 I remember for me, when I first moved to DC,

336
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,540
 I went to the Capitol and I listened

337
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,620
 to this amazing message this guy was telling us.

338
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,300
 Everything wrong with American society

339
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,420
 and why it's falling apart.

340
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,180
 And then as he enlisted all these problems,

341
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,540
 he ran out of time and then he left.

342
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,060
 And I remember at the end I was like,

343
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,780
 is there an answer?

344
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,500
 Was that a diagnosis or an autopsy of how we died?

345
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,700
 Like, what's happening?

346
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,100
 So I could stand up here and read you the data on you

347
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,660
 and what's the matter with this world today?

348
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,620
 But let me tell you something.

349
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,300
 I would rather move us towards focusing on a way forward

350
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,340
 because the good news is there is one.

351
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,340
 And the good news is I officiated four weddings

352
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,180
 in a month this spring, right?

353
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,500
 A personal record for me.

354
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,740
 So people are finding a way to pair off even in these days.

355
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,920
 So I wanna talk about dating.

356
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,200
 And in different cultures, at different times in histories,

357
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,740
 that process of evaluating and pairing off with people

358
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,020
 has been varied.

359
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,380
 The dominant form of evaluating potential spouse today

360
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,900
 in this world is dating.

361
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,380
 And I just wanna say this about dating.

362
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,020
 Dating is a process you move through,

363
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,960
 not a status you sit in.

364
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,420
 Dating is meant to be a process by which you evaluate

365
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,540
 whether me and this other person are meant to link hands

366
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,020
 and run for a lifetime.

367
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
 It is not a status you sit in.

368
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,180
 Well, I guess we're dating now

369
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,880
 and then linger there for years.

370
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,820
 Mark Ragnaris at the University of Texas

371
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,100
 has done a ton of research about your generation,

372
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,820
 what he calls serial monogamy.

373
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,860
 Just hanging out in an amorphous dating experience.

374
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,540
 He says in survey after survey,

375
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,940
 all it leads people to is much drama

376
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,060
 and in the end, mixed memories and wasted time.

377
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,020
 That we're not meant to dwell in dating

378
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,260
 any longer than we must.

379
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,020
 It is a process to move through, not a status to sit in.

380
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,580
 And it's meant to move towards marriage.

381
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,500
 Am I meant to bind myself with you

382
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,220
 until death do us part as we run this race together?

383
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,340
 And so I wanna talk about it,

384
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,620
 but I know some of you might be saying,

385
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,460
 well, wait a minute, Ben,

386
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,420
 the Bible doesn't talk about dating.

387
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,740
 And that's true.

388
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,980
 As Greg Mott used to say,

389
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,380
 there's no passage that says,

390
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,740
 and Moses took Zipporah into Chili's

391
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
 and they had a great time.

392
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,100
 Like it's not in there.

393
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,080
 So how are you gonna preach dating from the Bible?

394
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,020
 Well, the Bible doesn't talk about dating per se,

395
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,620
 but it does have much to say about evaluation.

396
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,080
 You look at the book of Proverbs,

397
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,420
 which was written to young men.

398
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,580
 Proverbs 25 says,

399
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,740
 "It's better to live on the corner of a roof

400
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,100
 "than in a house with a contentious woman."

401
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,340
 That wasn't written to the married guy,

402
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,460
 hanging from his roof going,

403
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,300
 "No, you tell me."

404
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,740
 It's like, no, it was written to the single guy

405
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,340
 to say, "Watch that girl.

406
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,180
 "She always have drama.

407
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,400
 "Her and her roommates always fighting.

408
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
 "Well, don't link up with her forever

409
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,460
 "because you'll never have peace in your home."

410
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,300
 Proverbs 25 says,

411
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,840
 "A man without self-control is like a city broken into

412
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,700
 "and left without walls."

413
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,060
 Is that guy given to fits of rage?

414
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,420
 He's always bowing up on people.

415
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,340
 Can he not control his own impulses?

416
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
 Does he say, "I'm struggling."

417
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,020
 And what that means is he's always being defeated.

418
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,900
 If that's the case, if he has no self-control,

419
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,860
 you be careful, your home will never feel safe.

420
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,980
 And so the Bible has much to say about how to evaluate

421
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,380
 how we pair off with somebody else.

422
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,860
 And we can debate whether or not dating

423
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,040
 is frankly the best way to do that,

424
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,660
 but I'd rather just focus on the principles

425
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,980
 laid out in scripture that will help us properly evaluate

426
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,060
 whether or not somebody is a good fit.

427
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,140
 And so I could give you a list of principles,

428
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,540
 but really what I wanted to do today,

429
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,700
 why I just want to take a different path,

430
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,660
 I want to show us this story.

431
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,460
 I think this image can capture our imagination.

432
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,040
 And I'm going to go fast and I'm already talking fast,

433
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,260
 but let me tell you why.

434
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,300
 I don't want you to think fast equals flippant.

435
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
 I'm going to move through some weighty issues of the heart,

436
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,340
 but I just want to get as much out to you as I can.

437
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,740
 Because if you look at the book of Genesis,

438
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,940
 Genesis moves with stunning brevity

439
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,580
 through amazing moments in the history of creation.

440
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,200
 You see the creation of the world, the creation of humanity.

441
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,220
 You see the fall where evil came from

442
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,180
 and how it's dealt with.

443
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,940
 You see society form, you see God judge evil

444
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,060
 and then resurrect humanity from its ashes.

445
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,540
 You've seen God move all these massive planks.

446
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,440
 And then suddenly in Genesis chapter 12,

447
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,540
 the narrative slows down.

448
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,580
 And rather than going through these big epics in history,

449
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,580
 it zooms in on one man, Abraham and his wife and their kids.

450
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,780
 And God says to Abraham,

451
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,340
 "I want you to move away from your father's house

452
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,440
 "and everything you know.

453
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,980
 "I'm going to put you on a piece of real estate

454
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,820
 "that matters to me.

455
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,800
 "I'll tell you why later.

456
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,660
 "And there I'm going to give you a seed offspring

457
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,660
 "and your seed will bless the whole world."

458
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,500
 When humanity broke in Genesis three,

459
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,180
 God's promise to us was the seed of the woman

460
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,540
 will crush the serpent's head.

461
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,900
 A boy is coming that's going to wreck shop

462
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
 on the one who deceived us

463
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,020
 and broke the way humanity relates to one another.

464
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,360
 And God tells Abraham,

465
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,240
 "You're going to have a seed that blesses the world.

466
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,520
 "Move to this piece of land.

467
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,760
 "I'm going to give you a seed

468
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,420
 "and he will bless every family on earth."

469
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
 Abraham does it.

470
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,220
 He's moved, he's had a full life.

471
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,300
 And now there's just one thing that remains.

472
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,420
 Abraham needs his son to get married

473
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,980
 so that his lineage can continue.

474
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,020
 And so the way they're going to do this,

475
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,600
 I don't know if you caught it as I was reading it,

476
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,540
 their process of pairing off was different.

477
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,560
 It's more like a arranged marriage.

478
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,460
 And I'm not going to advocate for arranged marriage tonight.

479
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,700
 But some of the guiding principles,

480
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,020
 I think will apply to us.

481
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,660
 And then I think we'll get some good practices

482
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,500
 along the way.

483
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,320
 Amen?

484
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
 So let's move through it together.

485
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,980
 Verse one.

486
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,500
 So we arrive at our text.

487
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,860
 Things are looking pretty good for Abraham.

488
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,300
 It says, "Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years,

489
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,660
 "and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things."

490
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,500
 That sounds like a great place to end a story,

491
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,100
 not start one.

492
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,340
 But in verse two, "Abraham said to his servant,

493
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,600
 "the oldest of his household,

494
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,180
 "who had charge of all that he had,

495
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,300
 "put your hand under my thigh,

496
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,100
 "that I may make you swear by the Lord,

497
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,660
 "the God of heaven and the God of earth."

498
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,060
 Now stop right there.

499
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,380
 Before we even look at what he's going to make him swear,

500
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,480
 notice the author wants us to see

501
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,720
 something of incredible significance is happening here.

502
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,840
 And he lets us see it in three ways.

503
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,560
 Number one, Abraham doesn't just call for a servant,

504
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,860
 he calls for his most loyal and proven employee.

505
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,480
 The guy who's been through it all and now manages it all.

506
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,840
 I need that guy.

507
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,560
 And then he brings that guy and makes him swear an oath

508
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,940
 by the Lord of heaven and earth.

509
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,840
 You don't make a guy do that

510
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,280
 in order to just pay the light bill.

511
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,840
 You know, whatever he's about to say is critical information.

512
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,080
 And then he tells him,

513
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,040
 "Put your hand under my thigh as you swear this."

514
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
 Now commentators all agree, and I'll quote,

515
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,560
 "That under my thigh is a euphemism that means

516
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,320
 "take the man's reproductive parts into your hand."

517
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,000
 Which some of you go, "Uh, what?

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,360
 "Why would he do that?"

519
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,800
 Don't really have time to go into it.

520
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
 We can spend a lot of time talking about it.

521
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,920
 Happens a couple times in the Bible.

522
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,740
 The point is, it's a very serious oath.

523
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,640
 You don't do that all the time.

524
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,080
 Why does he do it here?

525
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,280
 Well, again, we can go into details,

526
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,040
 but when God promised Abraham, "Through your seed,

527
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 "I'll bless the whole world,"

528
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,840
 God gave him the symbol of circumcision.

529
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,160
 It's through your seed that I will bring the one

530
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,960
 who will crush the serpent's head and bring peace.

531
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
 And so when he tells him that,

532
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,280
 this symbol, this imagery is about posterity.

533
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,720
 The hope of the world is coming here.

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,320
 So swear to me, by the promise given to me by God,

535
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,160
 that you'll do what I'm about to ask you to do.

536
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,860
 And I mention that, even though it's a little weird,

537
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,000
 to just make this point.

538
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,280
 God takes marriage really, really seriously.

539
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,000
 This is the longest chapter in Genesis.

540
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
 Why?

541
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
 God is showing us how he'll provide for Isaac,

542
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,160
 but I think it's meant to be an encouragement to you.

543
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,780
 God cares about your love life.

544
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,480
 I think for some people,

545
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
 when they feel that longing so intensely,

546
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,960
 they feel embarrassed by it.

547
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,080
 I shouldn't want so badly to pair off.

548
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,960
 And I'm just letting you know, God cares.

549
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,540
 It's a serious issue to him.

550
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,380
 It matters.

551
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,240
 Specifically, who you marry matters.

552
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,220
 And so notice the oath Abraham makes him swear in verse three.

553
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,620
 Swear that you will not take a wife for my son

554
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,340
 from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell,

555
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,660
 but you'll go to my country to my kindred

556
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,500
 and take a wife for my son, Isaac.

557
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,220
 Now what's going on here?

558
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,900
 Is Abraham racist?

559
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,100
 Can't marry a Canaanite?

560
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,420
 It's not about ethnicity.

561
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
 It's about allegiance.

562
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,260
 In the scriptures,

563
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,120
 people marry across ethnic lines all the time.

564
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,800
 Moses did it, Ruth did it.

565
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,220
 It's not about ethnicity.

566
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,680
 The Canaanites believed in multiple gods

567
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,440
 and their worship of them was surrounded

568
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 by violence and sexual exploitation.

569
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,380
 Completely at odds with Abraham's commitment

570
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,080
 to a God of grace and truth.

571
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,800
 So as he's thinking about who he wants his boy to marry,

572
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,480
 he says, you know what?

573
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,040
 My family in the old country, they're not perfect,

574
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,360
 but they have an allegiance to the one true God.

575
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 And thus Abraham says, his first and really only criteria

576
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,660
 for a wife for his son is she must be a woman of faith.

577
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,880
 She must believe in the one true God.

578
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
 That's your first point,

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,060
 that you wanna marry a man or woman of faith.

580
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,680
 For the Christian, our love is meant to overflow

581
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,080
 expected banks in the culture and go everywhere.

582
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,040
 Jesus told us to love our enemies.

583
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,320
 We're supposed to love everybody.

584
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,100
 But when you talk about your inner ring,

585
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
 the person you bind yourself together with,

586
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
 you want it to be a person

587
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
 who has the same allegiance you do in life.

588
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,040
 You want a person who's walking by faith

589
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,720
 in the God you love.

590
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,040
 Paul told Timothy, flee youthful lust,

591
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,080
 pursue righteousness, love, joy, and peace,

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,280
 along with those who call out to God out of a pure heart.

593
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
 You wanna run together with someone

594
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
 who's moving the same direction as you.

595
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,560
 You think about why people get divorced.

596
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,300
 What's the most common thing they say?

597
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,800
 Our lives went different directions.

598
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,560
 What do they mean by that?

599
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,840
 They don't mean, well, I'm a lawyer and she's a librarian.

600
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,680
 What do they have in common?

601
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,700
 They're not talking about career.

602
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,380
 They're talking about in values.

603
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,800
 In the biggest issues in life, we value life differently

604
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,360
 because here's the reality.

605
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,500
 Whatever you think is most valuable in the world

606
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,240
 will shape your values.

607
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,340
 And your values will shape your decisions

608
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,160
 and your decisions shape your life.

609
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,360
 And so when you are gonna build a life with someone,

610
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,600
 make sure you are lockstep on the biggest issues in life.

611
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,640
 And yet I'll talk to some young people, go like,

612
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,760
 well, I mean, technically he's a monotheist.

613
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,800
 Okay.

614
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,260
 Some variety's good.

615
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,380
 He likes CrossFit, you like Pilates, that's fine.

616
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,700
 But in the biggest issues in life,

617
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,720
 what do I think ultimate reality is

618
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,120
 and why do I think we're all here?

619
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,080
 You don't wanna go, what's the bare minimum

620
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,260
 I can settle for?

621
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,840
 I remember hearing Tommy Nelson say it

622
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,680
 to a room like this years ago.

623
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
 He said, "The loneliness of being single

624
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,900
 "is not assuaged by the loneliness you'll feel

625
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,440
 "in a king-sized bed laying next to a man

626
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,480
 "who cannot speak with you about the deepest things in life."

627
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,160
 You don't compromise here, don't settle here.

628
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,400
 But notice it's not just marry a believer in God.

629
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,680
 The servant responds with a question.

630
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
 In verse five, the servant says,

631
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,180
 "Perhaps the woman may not be willing

632
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,640
 "to follow me to this land.

633
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
 "Must I then take your son back

634
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,760
 "to the land from which you came?

635
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,080
 "That seems like a reasonable request.

636
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,040
 "Hey, if she's not willing to take this trip back,

637
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,840
 "can I resettle the boy in the old country?"

638
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,000
 You know, let her be near her family,

639
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,440
 let her continue her career, be supportive,

640
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
 that sort of thing.

641
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,000
 And it gets a strong reaction from Abraham.

642
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,160
 In verse six, Abraham says, "See to it

643
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,240
 "you do not take my son back there."

644
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,120
 The NAS translates it, "Beware you take my son back there."

645
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,200
 What's Abraham's deal?

646
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,000
 Is he a chauvinist?

647
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
 Why does he say that?

648
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,480
 Verse seven, "The Lord, the God of heaven,

649
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
 "who took me from my father's house,

650
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,900
 "from the land of my kindred,

651
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,200
 "and who spoke to me and who swore to me,

652
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,440
 "saying to your offspring, I'll give this land.

653
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,040
 "He will send his angel before you

654
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,000
 "and you shall take away from my son there."

655
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
 Why is he so serious about this?

656
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,160
 Because Abraham doesn't have this.

657
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,520
 We're here in the story.

658
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
 He doesn't have the whole scripture to read,

659
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,280
 but he had a profound encounter with God in Genesis 12

660
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,600
 that was reaffirmed by a covenant in Genesis 15.

661
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,360
 He had two directives, move to this land

662
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,680
 and you will have offspring,

663
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,480
 and that offspring will bless the whole world

664
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,120
 from this strategic piece of real estate,

665
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,360
 which is really the only land bridge

666
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,540
 between three major continents.

667
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,840
 We don't have time to get into all that,

668
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,600
 but God says, "I want you right there

669
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,120
 "when you have your seed that will bless the world."

670
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,720
 And Abraham says, "I got two commands from the king.

671
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,140
 "Be here, have a kid, I'm doing that.

672
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,200
 "And so no, the boy can't leave."

673
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,440
 And it's not because I'm not supportive of who this girl is,

674
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,160
 it's because God told us to move by faith.

675
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,600
 And so you don't just wanna marry someone of faith,

676
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,440
 you wanna marry someone who is moving by faith,

677
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,840
 walking by faith.

678
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,920
 My allegiance to God affects the decisions I make.

679
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
 Beware that you go back.

680
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
 God called us to the cutting edge of faith,

681
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,980
 and if this girl won't go with us, then she's not the one.

682
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,280
 What kind of woman would not be willing to go with him?

683
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,160
 Some of you ladies may say, "A prudent one."

684
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,720
 I mean, like, she doesn't even know these people.

685
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,960
 But back then, this would have been a good arrangement.

686
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,560
 These weren't strangers, they knew these people,

687
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,540
 this would have been fitting with the culture of the day.

688
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,920
 The woman who would have said, "I don't wanna go with you,"

689
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,440
 is one who says, "I don't wanna live by faith like you do.

690
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,700
 "I'll attend church with you a little bit,

691
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,880
 "I'll believe there's a God up there,

692
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,920
 "but I don't want it to shape my decisions.

693
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,120
 "I don't wanna give away my money."

694
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,200
 Says, "No, she has to live on the cutting edge of faith.

695
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 "We sold everything and moved with God,

696
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,760
 "and I wanna be linked up with someone like that."

697
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,200
 I remember I had a buddy years ago,

698
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,500
 he agreed to run a marathon with a coworker.

699
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,680
 And so he was passionate about it,

700
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
 and so he started to train every day.

701
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,640
 She did not.

702
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,800
 And so when they got to the marathon,

703
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,440
 he was just running at their agreed upon pace,

704
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,640
 and she was struggling keeping up.

705
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,000
 But then she didn't want him to leave, stay with me.

706
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,360
 And he was so mad, 'cause he said,

707
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,960
 "I had a passion to do this, and I had a pace,

708
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
 "and now you're holding me back."

709
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,720
 For me, I ran one marathon in life,

710
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,760
 and I did it with my sister,

711
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,160
 'cause she asked me to and I love her.

712
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,160
 And we trained every single day, every step together,

713
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,760
 and so when it came time to run the race,

714
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
 we were lockstep together, just moving together,

715
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 laughing, talking, accelerating, why?

716
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,660
 'Cause we had the same passion, the same pace,

717
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,640
 moving together, and that's how you wanna do marriage.

718
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,600
 You don't wanna compromise here.

719
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,740
 Anybody can say they're a Christian.

720
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,940
 I had a friend in college get sexually assaulted

721
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,240
 on our first date by a guy who had a Bible

722
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,840
 on his coffee table and an Ixhus on the back of his car,

723
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,760
 a Christian bumper sticker.

724
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,880
 I had a country friend who used to say it this way,

725
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,000
 "You can put a bow tie on a turd,

726
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,680
 "but it's still a turd."

727
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,680
 So I don't care what someone calls themselves.

728
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,560
 Yeah, I believe in God.

729
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
 Yeah, I'm a Christian.

730
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,880
 I wanna watch your life, not just a person of faith,

731
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,960
 but someone who moves by faith,

732
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,520
 that my allegiance to God affects my direction,

733
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,680
 because you wanna say, "I'm following the king.

734
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,220
 "I live for him, and I wanna run after him,

735
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,660
 "and I want the person next to me

736
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,120
 "to be running lockstep in stride together."

737
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,960
 That's what you want.

738
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,660
 You want someone that you're sprinting along

739
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,340
 with a second engine to the car,

740
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,300
 not someone you're dragging behind, do you see it?

741
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,400
 For me and Donna, that's what I was looking for,

742
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,460
 a woman who wanted to run after God as hard as I did.

743
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,300
 And let me tell you something,

744
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,700
 your marriage will be strongest

745
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,500
 when it's on mission together, okay?

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,100
 Maybe not the same vocation,

747
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,500
 but same direction, same passion, do you see it?

748
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,520
 Now, as soon as I say that, I know some of you go,

749
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
 "Yeah, Ben, that's why we're here.

750
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,020
 "That's what we want."

751
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,620
 And it's easy for you to say that,

752
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,180
 but what are the odds I'm gonna find someone like that?

753
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,540
 The good ones are all gone.

754
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,900
 Look at Abraham's mentality in verse seven.

755
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,860
 The Lord, the God of heaven,

756
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,820
 who took me from my father's house,

757
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,480
 from the land of my kindred,

758
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,660
 who spoke to me and swore to me,

759
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,340
 "To your offspring I'll give this land.

760
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,220
 "He will send his angel before you,

761
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,180
 "and you shall take a wife for my son from there."

762
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,660
 What's Abraham's perspective?

763
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,140
 If I've trusted God with my life,

764
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,600
 I can trust God with my love life, right?

765
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,960
 He's a man of faith.

766
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,900
 So you don't just wanna marry someone of faith,

767
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,060
 you wanna enter into this process as a person of faith.

768
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,820
 If I've trusted Jesus with my eternal state,

769
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,420
 then I can trust him with my Friday night.

770
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,660
 And I meet a lot of people that say,

771
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,540
 "Oh yeah, my heart belongs to Jesus."

772
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,460
 But when it comes to dating,

773
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,820
 suddenly it gets weird.

774
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,380
 I gotta dress a certain way and act a certain way

775
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
 to land, bag, trick, get some person

776
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,380
 because it's just me out here

777
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,220
 and I gotta figure this out.

778
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,180
 And you go, "No, no, no, no, no.

779
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,500
 "Desperation is a bad look for everybody."

780
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,320
 And so I gotta say,

781
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,020
 "Man, if I trust God with my eternal destiny,

782
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,700
 "then I'll trust him with my destiny on Friday night."

783
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,900
 I wanna be someone who's living by faith

784
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,360
 in the way I move into a dating circle, right?

785
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,960
 You wanna walk into a date

786
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,900
 with the quiet confidence of knowing

787
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,920
 God determines my steps.

788
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,420
 I can be me and a good version of you.

789
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,560
 I mean, bathe.

790
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,520
 But I'm not there trying to convince somebody

791
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,020
 that we're meant to be together.

792
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,500
 I'm walking with God by faith

793
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,540
 and I'm just evaluating,

794
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,180
 are we meant to run together as we seek him?

795
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,020
 Do you see it?

796
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,620
 And then Abraham's final words to his servants

797
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,900
 are in verse eight.

798
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,100
 "But if the woman's not willing to follow you,

799
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,040
 "you'll be free from this oath of mine,

800
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,140
 "only you must not take my son back there."

801
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,660
 Notice his perspective.

802
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,020
 Hey, if this doesn't work, I'm willing to let it go.

803
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,940
 If she won't walk by faith,

804
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,700
 then you come home empty handed.

805
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,560
 But I'd rather my son be single

806
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,400
 than settle for second best.

807
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,780
 Don't compromise.

808
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,540
 Don't get scared and settle.

809
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,660
 So the servant put his hand under his thigh

810
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,780
 of Abraham, his master,

811
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,700
 and swore to him concerning this matter.

812
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,860
 Then the servant took 10 of his master's camels

813
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,700
 and departed,

814
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
 taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master

815
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,380
 and he rose and went to Mesopotamia

816
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,620
 to the city of Nahor.

817
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,380
 All right, so the servant's journey begins.

818
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,540
 Will he be successful?

819
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,620
 As we round the corner here,

820
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,900
 I wanna move from just general guiding principles

821
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,140
 to some practical advice, okay?

822
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,220
 And so here's the first practical advice

823
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,340
 we're gonna get from the servant

824
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,660
 as he's searching for the one.

825
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,240
 Look in the right place.

826
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,080
 Look in the right place.

827
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,900
 Notice it says he travels to the city of Nahor.

828
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,060
 Nahor is not the name of the city.

829
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,900
 Nahor is the name of Abraham's brother,

830
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,980
 which seems intuitive.

831
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,100
 If I'm going to find Abraham's kinsmen,

832
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,420
 let me go to the city that houses the kinsmen of Abraham.

833
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,100
 Let me go where his relatives live.

834
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,660
 Makes sense.

835
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,200
 If I'm looking for someone,

836
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,460
 let me go to their house.

837
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,340
 If I'm looking for someone's kid,

838
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,920
 let me go to their house.

839
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,700
 If I'm looking for a daughter of God,

840
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,020
 let me go to God's house.

841
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,260
 If I wanna marry a child of God,

842
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,520
 go to God's house.

843
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,080
 Show up where those people would be.

844
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,820
 It seems like such an obvious point.

845
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,200
 But I remember years ago,

846
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,880
 I was invited to Dallas and spoke at this single thing.

847
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,160
 It was packed out kind of like this.

848
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,640
 And I did a survey in the room of all these people,

849
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
 what church you go to.

850
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,200
 They were all going to the same church together.

851
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,560
 And then I asked them where they're all primarily dating.

852
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
 And their number one and number two choices

853
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
 were on apps and in bars.

854
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,480
 I'm not gonna criticize apps.

855
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,000
 I've done weddings with people who met on apps.

856
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,780
 There's some values to them.

857
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,840
 There's some downsides, but there is some values to it.

858
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,880
 And you can meet wonderful people at the bar.

859
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,440
 I'm not saying you can't do that either.

860
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,320
 But I'm just saying, think about the odds.

861
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,120
 If you wanna marry a person of God,

862
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,440
 and I told that room of girls,

863
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,280
 'cause some of them were like,

864
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
 yeah, we don't date the guys here.

865
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,120
 I don't really know.

866
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,080
 I was like, all right, just for a second.

867
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
 I said, I'll give you.

868
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,360
 What if out of 100 guys,

869
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,220
 90 of them are just goobers?

870
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,440
 I mean, just, it's hopeless.

871
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,280
 You're just like, like, just think about that.

872
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,960
 I said, that's still 10 guys

873
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,760
 that you'd want your son to be like.

874
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,520
 What are your odds at the bar?

875
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,360
 Are they better than that?

876
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,720
 I said, look, I don't know.

877
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
 And I'm not saying you can't find people there,

878
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,360
 but I'm just saying for me,

879
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,880
 like if I wanna find a Texan, I've met some in DC,

880
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,620
 but the percentage shot goes way up when I come to Texas.

881
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,320
 And if you wanna meet someone that loves the Lord,

882
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,920
 go to the places where people who love the Lord hang out.

883
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,120
 That's all I'm trying to say in this point.

884
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,560
 It's not real complicated, okay?

885
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,080
 I remember we did our volunteer Christmas party.

886
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,320
 And like I said, two thirds of our church

887
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,760
 are single and under 30.

888
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
 We had our volunteer Christmas party.

889
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,520
 And I'll never forget, these two young men walked up to me

890
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
 and I had written a book on dating.

891
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,760
 They're like, hey man, you wrote the book on dating.

892
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,160
 How do we meet girls?

893
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,320
 And I looked over their shoulder

894
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,760
 at our four or 500 volunteers.

895
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,080
 I was like, well, guys, I'll tell you where to start.

896
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,440
 Stop talking to me.

897
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,400
 (congregation laughing)

898
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,880
 I said, this isn't just, we've called them out.

899
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,920
 We've called out not just girls that go to this church,

900
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
 but are serving here,

901
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,240
 actively involved in the business of God.

902
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,320
 And we threw a party, they got dressed up,

903
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,120
 they look nice, they're wonderful people.

904
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,480
 If you can't play ball on this field,

905
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,760
 70 degree weather, no wind, nice lush grass.

906
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,440
 If you can't play ball here,

907
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,280
 I don't know what else to do, man.

908
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
 (congregation laughing)

909
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
 So he goes to the city of Nahor.

910
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,760
 And some of you go, well, Ben, that's great.

911
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,640
 You go, but Ben, I don't have any people

912
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,880
 in my social circle that wanna walk with God.

913
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,640
 Move!

914
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,360
 (congregation laughing)

915
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,840
 This city was 500 miles away from where Isaac lived.

916
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,200
 That was his willingness, right?

917
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
 That sometimes you've gotta walk 500 miles

918
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,800
 and sometimes you gotta walk 500 more

919
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,480
 just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles

920
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,160
 to fall down at a shore.

921
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,000
 It's all right.

922
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,120
 (congregation applauding)

923
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,200
 Get into a different crowd of people.

924
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,680
 Just don't settle.

925
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,000
 All right, so he arrives at the city,

926
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,280
 but he's more specific than that.

927
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,520
 Verse 11, he makes the camels kneel down outside the city

928
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,360
 by the well of water at the time of evening,

929
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,280
 the time when women go out to draw water.

930
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,040
 That's tip number two, go where the women are.

931
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
 (congregation laughing)

932
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,000
 But notice what kind of women.

933
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,840
 Those who are providing for their family.

934
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,600
 And that's important.

935
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
 All through the Bible, godly women

936
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,880
 have been those who are willing to work hard.

937
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,960
 I will see it in a moment in Rebecca.

938
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,200
 Moses' wife was a shepherdess.

939
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,740
 The Shulamite in Song of Solomon worked in the vineyard.

940
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,360
 Ruth gleaned the fields.

941
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,660
 A woman who's willing to work is a prize.

942
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,240
 The high yield woman, the mighty woman, the righteous one,

943
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
 the warrior woman of Proverbs 31,

944
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,400
 it says she girds herself with strength.

945
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,440
 She makes her arms strong.

946
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,260
 She's not a passive woman.

947
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,640
 She feeds her family, clothes them,

948
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,600
 conducts wise business.

949
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,840
 She's buying and selling real estate,

950
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,480
 invests, serves the needy.

951
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,280
 She's not an idle and weak person in Proverbs 31.

952
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,860
 You want a girl like this.

953
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,520
 I know when I was single,

954
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,040
 I was the last one of my friends to get married,

955
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,160
 but I remember in that moment

956
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
 as I dwelled longer in singleness,

957
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,600
 like some of you maybe feel,

958
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,360
 I'm dwelling in a long time, I said, you know what?

959
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,640
 But I want a girl that I'm gonna meet

960
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,300
 in the midst of the work.

961
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,680
 I'm running hard after God.

962
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,080
 I wanna make a difference with my life,

963
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,120
 and I wanna make a girl on the mission field.

964
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,800
 I wanna meet a girl that's working like that.

965
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 And so you want somebody like that.

966
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,640
 And when I met Donna,

967
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,240
 she was involved in a church serving,

968
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,460
 discipling young girls.

969
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,880
 She had worked at a barbecue restaurant.

970
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,300
 She had calloused hands.

971
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,440
 (congregation laughing)

972
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,280
 Amen.

973
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,040
 Let me apply this in two ways.

974
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,800
 You want an industrious person.

975
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,140
 You don't wanna marry a lazy person, by the way.

976
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,380
 They'll frustrate you to no end

977
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,800
 when it comes time to pay bills,

978
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,640
 earn a living, clean your house, et cetera, okay?

979
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,440
 And so ladies, take your cues from Rebecca.

980
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,400
 Just decide to work hard.

981
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,360
 Guys, take your cues from Isaac.

982
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,820
 His servant rolls up with 10 camels, okay?

983
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,920
 That mean Isaac was paid, right?

984
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,960
 He had a job.

985
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,260
 Now, I'm not saying you gotta be rich.

986
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,080
 I'm just saying you gotta be employed, okay?

987
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,100
 So you get out there and hustle up and get some camels

988
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,840
 to show that you can be a productive human being in society.

989
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,040
 The other thing I wanna say before we move on from this

990
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,080
 is you're gonna find the workers working.

991
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,400
 I wanna find a worker, then find the workers working, right?

992
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,280
 So if you wanna marry someone who's industrious

993
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,380
 in the things of God, that are doing things that matter,

994
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,780
 you might find them sitting next to you at church.

995
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,240
 You're probably more likely to find them

996
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,540
 serving in the nursery, serving on the greeting team,

997
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,400
 serving in a church capacity, serving here at the porch.

998
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
 If you wanna work with the workers,

999
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,320
 get working where they work.

1000
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,480
 You wanna fly with the flyers,

1001
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,360
 go where flyers are flying, right?

1002
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
 And so if you wanna be with somebody

1003
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,960
 that's industrious and moving, get involved.

1004
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,320
 Get involved in your local church, get involved in serve,

1005
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,360
 get involved here at the porch, move.

1006
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,560
 And you'll find some people moving alongside of you

1007
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,160
 and you'll run together, that's the idea.

1008
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,080
 And then notice what he does

1009
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,480
 when he gets to his destination, verse 12.

1010
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,320
 It says, "And he prayed,

1011
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,680
 "'Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham,

1012
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,560
 "'please grant me success today

1013
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,440
 "'and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.'"

1014
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,360
 That's your next tip.

1015
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,880
 He actively invites God into the process.

1016
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,480
 He hasn't initiated yet with a woman,

1017
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,320
 but he gets there and he goes,

1018
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,720
 "Okay, God, I need you to show up."

1019
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,120
 In prayer, let me just tell you,

1020
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
 we don't have time to belabor this,

1021
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,720
 it takes the desperation out of dating.

1022
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,980
 Okay, there's a God over this who's guiding us.

1023
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,240
 There's a God over this who's worthy of our trust.

1024
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,120
 I don't need to rule out of anxiety.

1025
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,320
 I cast my cares upon him because he cares for me,

1026
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,440
 the scripture says.

1027
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,040
 So I know he cares for me.

1028
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,960
 I can be settled in this moment.

1029
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
 And so he prays, like Proverbs tells us,

1030
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,320
 "In all your ways, acknowledge him

1031
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,040
 "and he'll make your path straight.

1032
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,840
 "God, I invite you into this moment."

1033
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,040
 It's something I pray all the time

1034
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,200
 when I'm talking to people.

1035
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,660
 "God, I invite you into this moment.

1036
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,840
 "You're already here, but I just wanna acknowledge

1037
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,060
 "your presence in this.

1038
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,240
 "Give me the grace in this moment

1039
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,880
 "to be fully present with you, God,

1040
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,480
 "as I talk to this person."

1041
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,040
 I would pray that when I was single

1042
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
 and walked into rooms like this.

1043
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,900
 I don't know if I'm here to encourage a friend,

1044
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,680
 make a friend, or meet the one, I don't know.

1045
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,920
 But I know I wanna walk in saying,

1046
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,920
 "God, you're leading me and guide me where you have me go."

1047
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,360
 And so he prays.

1048
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,180
 And in verse 13, we get the substance of the prayer.

1049
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,500
 "Behold, I'm standing by the spring of water.

1050
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,660
 "The daughters of the men of the city

1051
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
 "are coming out to draw water.

1052
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,180
 "Let the woman to whom I shall say,

1053
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,220
 "please let down your jar that I may drink.

1054
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,280
 "And who shall say, drink it, I'll water your camels.

1055
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,000
 "Let her be the one that you have appointed

1056
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,080
 "for your servant Isaac.

1057
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,940
 "By this I shall know that you have shown

1058
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,220
 "steadfast love to my master."

1059
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,500
 Now, I can't affirm that it'll work out this way.

1060
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,460
 "Lord, let the one I'm sitting by at the porch

1061
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,860
 "be the one I am meant to marry."

1062
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,900
 Thank you, Lord.

1063
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,260
 (congregation laughing)

1064
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,940
 I don't know.

1065
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,740
 But I want you to notice what criteria he's looking for.

1066
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,620
 This is an old man.

1067
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,380
 He said, "I'm gonna approach as an old man

1068
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,200
 "and ask for a drink of water.

1069
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,520
 "And I want her to be someone who will not only help me

1070
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
 "and give me a drink,

1071
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,580
 "but will help me with all my animals too."

1072
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,540
 He's looking for graciousness.

1073
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,420
 That's your next tip.

1074
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,820
 You wanna look for a gracious person.

1075
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,540
 Proverbs 11 says, "A gracious woman attains honor."

1076
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,720
 This lady is gonna end up marrying an incredible guy.

1077
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,020
 How did he get there?

1078
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,400
 How did she get there?

1079
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,660
 She was kind.

1080
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,720
 She was hospitable.

1081
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,580
 I watched a fascinating phenomenon,

1082
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,980
 and this'll sound terrible, I know,

1083
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,800
 but there was two social spheres I was in,

1084
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,540
 one in high school and one in college,

1085
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,100
 where there was a girl in each of those spheres

1086
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,340
 that was, in both situations,

1087
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,620
 middle of the pack in terms of attractiveness.

1088
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,300
 I know it's terrible, I told you it was gonna be.

1089
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,840
 But the most interesting social phenomenon would happen.

1090
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,020
 They would get asked out exponentially more

1091
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,340
 than everyone else.

1092
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,840
 I mean, it was wild.

1093
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,240
 And you go, what was the common denominator?

1094
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,180
 They were both so nice.

1095
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,960
 They were both so kind.

1096
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,100
 They were encouraging to people.

1097
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,980
 They would help out.

1098
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,540
 One of them was at a restaurant I worked at.

1099
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,460
 She would help bus tables that weren't her tables.

1100
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,020
 You don't get paid for that.

1101
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,380
 And she would just do it for everybody,

1102
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,740
 not just one guy she liked.

1103
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,940
 She was just gracious.

1104
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,080
 And I would watch these guys get confused,

1105
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,460
 non-Christian guys, look at 'em and be like,

1106
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,660
 I love you.

1107
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,340
 I mean, over time, some of us were like, all right, easy.

1108
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,380
 But we just watched it.

1109
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,340
 We had to defend her,

1110
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,300
 because all these guys were attracted to that kindness.

1111
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
 And guys, it's the same with you.

1112
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,340
 Proverbs 19 says, "What's desirable in a man

1113
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,860
 "is his kindness."

1114
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,620
 I remember the first ministry I got involved in

1115
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
 as a young man.

1116
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,580
 I got involved in this para-church organization,

1117
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,980
 and I was in these Bible studies.

1118
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,580
 And after a while, I just made the observation

1119
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,500
 that all the men that led 'em were homely-looking guys.

1120
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,060
 With beautiful wives.

1121
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,580
 And one after another, I'm like, this is a trend.

1122
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,480
 What is happening?

1123
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,260
 And finally, I asked one of 'em.

1124
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,540
 I was like, hey, man, what is the deal?

1125
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,780
 'Cause I'm looking at you.

1126
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,140
 Then I'm looking at her.

1127
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,260
 And I'll never forget, he goes, it's a great question.

1128
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,620
 It's one I've asked myself.

1129
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,380
 He said, I'll tell ya.

1130
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,820
 He said, I was in college,

1131
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,940
 and this girl was so nice, so sweet, so kind, so amazing.

1132
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,460
 He said, I worked up all my courage,

1133
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,580
 and asked her out on a date.

1134
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,420
 She said yes.

1135
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,420
 I went back to my room, and was like, yes!

1136
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,740
 And then he realized, that's as far

1137
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,700
 as I had thought it through.

1138
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,260
 And so he got home, and he was like, oh no!

1139
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,100
 Like, I don't know what to do!

1140
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,340
 And he was freaking out, like, ah!

1141
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,860
 I just, it took all of me to just get the courage to ask her.

1142
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,260
 She actually said yes, I'm freaking out, I got no plan.

1143
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,660
 And he literally went to his Bible, and was like,

1144
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,500
 help me, Lord!

1145
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,020
 And threw it open to Proverbs 19.

1146
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,580
 What's desirable in a man is his kindness.

1147
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,380
 And he said, I may get everything else wrong tonight,

1148
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
 but I will be kind.

1149
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,780
 And they went on a date.

1150
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,060
 Fast forward, they're married, and he said,

1151
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,860
 Ben, we were laying in bed one night,

1152
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,780
 and I asked her the very question you just asked me.

1153
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,860
 How did this happen?

1154
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:58,820
 And he said, she went, you were just so kind.

1155
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,420
 You were so kind.

1156
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,260
 And he went.

1157
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,540
 Words.

1158
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,800
 So, he's looking for a woman that's kind.

1159
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,580
 Now notice the text says she's beautiful,

1160
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,620
 bonus, didn't pray for that, that's nice.

1161
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,500
 And it mentions that she had never been with a man.

1162
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,300
 That means she was a virgin.

1163
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,340
 Let me say this about that.

1164
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,580
 This is a whole other sermon for another day.

1165
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,660
 There's a value to sexual purity in the Bible.

1166
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,860
 Paul told the Thessalonians that you should abstain

1167
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,420
 from sexual immorality, so you're not,

1168
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,300
 you shouldn't wrong or defraud your brother in this way.

1169
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,860
 That you go, you know what?

1170
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,820
 Sexuality's a gift from God, meant to be confined

1171
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,380
 within a boundary of I promise to love all of you,

1172
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,840
 not just the part I wanna use.

1173
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,700
 And so here in the Bible, you see a value to sexuality

1174
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,180
 to protect it, it's a gift, protect it.

1175
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,580
 Give your body to someone who wants all of you,

1176
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,540
 wants to care about your heart, care about your feelings,

1177
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,060
 care about your mind, you want someone who cares about you.

1178
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,660
 Yet, I want you to notice, it was not a prerequisite

1179
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,200
 of Abraham's, because it's not a prerequisite of God's.

1180
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,340
 In the New Testament, the church is called

1181
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,220
 the Bride of Christ.

1182
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,820
 Jesus' bride did not come to him pristine.

1183
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,980
 Ephesians says he washed us by the water of his word.

1184
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,340
 We all come to Jesus sexually broken, everybody does.

1185
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,860
 You look through the Bible, every time people rebelled

1186
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,540
 against God, there was some sexual tragedy

1187
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,040
 associated with their culture.

1188
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,920
 And yet, God says sex is a gift, I gave it to you,

1189
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,980
 I want it to be protected within the boundaries

1190
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,500
 that are for your human flourishing.

1191
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,620
 Paul told the Corinthians to take it outside of it

1192
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,620
 is to sin against your own body.

1193
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,780
 And let me just make the point,

1194
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,480
 it messes up the evaluation process.

1195
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,200
 Sex is fun, God made it that way.

1196
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,860
 It releases oxytocin, which is a bonding agent in your mind,

1197
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,620
 it releases dopamine, the happy chemical

1198
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,440
 that says do that again.

1199
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,140
 But if you rush sexuality into the evaluation process

1200
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,820
 of dating, you'll stay connected with someone

1201
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,660
 for a long time before you even realize I can't trust them.

1202
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,540
 And so you're meant to hold that back

1203
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,580
 to evaluate their character and y'all's chemistry.

1204
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,660
 And then when you say we are meant to be together

1205
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,900
 until death do us part, then you enjoy the gift

1206
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,460
 God gave us of sexuality.

1207
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,660
 But I want you to be clear and know that if you say,

1208
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,940
 hey, I'm here and I'm not sexually pristine,

1209
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,140
 yeah, that's most everybody.

1210
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,900
 And it was not a prerequisite for a happy

1211
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,780
 and godly marriage.

1212
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,460
 If you look through the Bible, the lineage of Jesus

1213
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,660
 is filled with people with sexually devastated pasts.

1214
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,660
 Judah, Rahab, David, Bathsheba, not too far gone,

1215
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,120
 graciously forgiven, wonderful marriages,

1216
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,060
 a part of godly and great things.

1217
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,860
 So you be encouraged, right?

1218
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,340
 You see it?

1219
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,580
 All right, a lot more we can say there,

1220
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
 but I got to wrap up here.

1221
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,560
 All right, so all this servant knows right now

1222
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,520
 is that she's hot and carrying a water jug.

1223
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,620
 Sometimes that's not a bad place to start.

1224
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,660
 He asked her for a drink, you know what happens.

1225
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,140
 She gives him one and she says,

1226
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,540
 and I'll water for your camels.

1227
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,220
 And it says, he gazed in silence to learn

1228
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,580
 whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not.

1229
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,100
 Watch and learn, watch them for a while.

1230
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,580
 That's one of the benefits of being in a social circle

1231
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,860
 with people for a while, you just get to watch them.

1232
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,540
 Anyone can do good in an hour interview over dinner.

1233
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,520
 Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain, right?

1234
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
 But you just watch them in a social circle.

1235
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,100
 How do they treat old people?

1236
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,740
 How do they treat young people?

1237
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,820
 How do they treat people that won't serve

1238
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,340
 some direct advantage for them financially or socially?

1239
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,940
 That's how they'll treat you when you're not at your best.

1240
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,260
 Just watch and learn.

1241
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,500
 So he just watches her to learn, is this the one?

1242
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,140
 When I first met Donna, she was leading worship on a stage.

1243
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,980
 And let me tell you something,

1244
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,700
 that did not impress me at all.

1245
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,780
 Because there's enough benefit to being on a stage

1246
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,140
 in front of people that you could be doing it

1247
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,300
 for selfish and insecure and shallow reasons.

1248
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,740
 That's not sufficient for me, I had to watch her.

1249
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,980
 And I saw how she would disciple young girls,

1250
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,500
 didn't get paid for that.

1251
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,440
 Did it 'cause she loved the Lord,

1252
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,280
 loved her church and loved these girls.

1253
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,900
 I watched her serve selflessly over time.

1254
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,900
 I watched, this is a girl that doesn't just love God,

1255
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,680
 she's being shaped in the image of God.

1256
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,640
 That's who I wanna be bound together with.

1257
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,180
 Because she'll love me when I'm at my best

1258
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,780
 and I'm at my worst, right?

1259
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,820
 And so let me tell you something,

1260
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,940
 you wanna keep watching their character.

1261
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,120
 A woman who fears the Lord is to be praised, you want that.

1262
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,940
 He asked her her name, she says she's from Nahor.

1263
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,300
 And we'll close with this, the man bowed his head,

1264
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,620
 worshiped the Lord, blessed be the Lord,

1265
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,020
 the God of my master Abraham,

1266
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,060
 who's not forsaken his steadfast love

1267
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,860
 and his faithfulness towards my master.

1268
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,420
 He asked who she is, who is this gracious,

1269
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,660
 wonderful, kind woman?

1270
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,860
 And she says, I'm the relative of Nahor.

1271
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,620
 And he went, oh my God, you did it.

1272
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,380
 I thought it was impossible, you did it.

1273
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,580
 And he worships.

1274
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,580
 And let me tell you something, that's what you want.

1275
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,380
 You don't wanna settle for someone,

1276
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
 you wanna worship at the grace of God

1277
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,220
 to lead you to the right person.

1278
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,820
 I remember when I was in my 20s, I had a buddy

1279
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,300
 that he said he wanted to ask this girl out

1280
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,620
 that was so cute, sweet, and amazing.

1281
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,100
 And he said, but I'm scared.

1282
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,060
 And everyone was like, no, do it.

1283
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:12,880
 And he goes, no, man.

1284
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,980
 And then he took like a batter's stance and he goes,

1285
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,300
 this is how I feel.

1286
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,380
 Now batting out of his league, Jinx Curry.

1287
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,900
 And I remember when he said that, we all laughed like,

1288
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,820
 ah, that's funny.

1289
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,800
 And then one of the guys goes,

1290
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,300
 but that's how you wanna feel.

1291
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,380
 He said, you don't wanna get married to a girl and go,

1292
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,700
 you know, you were about the best I could pull off.

1293
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,940
 (congregation laughing)

1294
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,340
 Slid in right about here.

1295
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,540
 He says, you wanna marry someone that you go,

1296
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,580
 thank you, God, for leading me to a man like that,

1297
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,140
 leading me to a woman like that.

1298
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,020
 Thank you for leading me to a person like that.

1299
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,180
 I had been scared of marriage.

1300
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,500
 I waited a long time.

1301
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,080
 But when Donna and I finally figured out,

1302
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,620
 this is the one, I remember driving from Dallas

1303
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,340
 through the night up to Oklahoma to talk to her dad,

1304
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,540
 through the night down to meet her mom at the sunrise

1305
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,380
 the next morning.

1306
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,620
 Saw the sunset and sunrise to go talk to her parents.

1307
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,060
 'Cause once I knew it was her, let's go.

1308
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,460
 And that whole drive across Texas,

1309
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,580
 I remember at one point rolling the windows down

1310
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,820
 and worshiping.

1311
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,340
 God, you did it.

1312
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
 Took me longer than everyone else I know.

1313
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,980
 Isaac was 40 in this passage.

1314
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,220
 Sometimes you gotta wait for your pitch.

1315
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,940
 But when it's the right one, you worship.

1316
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,260
 And that's what you're meant to do.

1317
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,940
 The woman is asked finally at the end,

1318
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,420
 are you willing to go?

1319
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,700
 That's the big moment.

1320
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,900
 The servant tells the whole story again.

1321
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,980
 Family wants the servant to stay.

1322
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,260
 And the servant says, hey, call the girl in.

1323
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,700
 And she says, I'll go.

1324
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,880
 She's a woman of faith.

1325
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,740
 And she goes.

1326
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,500
 She rides with the servant.

1327
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,700
 And it says in verse 62,

1328
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,740
 now Isaac had returned from Beerlehai Roy

1329
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,380
 and was dwelling in the Negev.

1330
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,500
 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field towards evening.

1331
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,180
 He lifted up his eyes and saw,

1332
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,580
 and behold, there were camels coming.

1333
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,260
 And Rebecca lifted up her eyes.

1334
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,620
 And when she saw Isaac,

1335
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,260
 she dismounted from her camel.

1336
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,980
 And she said to the servant,

1337
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,780
 who is that man?

1338
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,080
 Walking in the field to meet us.

1339
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,480
 And the servant said, it's my master.

1340
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,020
 And she took her veil and covered herself.

1341
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,900
 And the servant told Isaac all the things he had done.

1342
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,240
 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother,

1343
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,380
 and took Rebecca and she became his wife.

1344
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,500
 And he loved her.

1345
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,340
 That's what she was.

1346
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,180
 But let me close with this.

1347
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,180
 This is a real story.

1348
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,100
 This is how the lineage of Jesus came together

1349
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,740
 where he showed up.

1350
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,620
 But it's also a picture.

1351
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,120
 It's a picture of what God is doing with you and me.

1352
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,900
 The father sends a servant

1353
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,420
 to tell a potential mate, I have a son.

1354
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,820
 A miraculous son.

1355
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,380
 Isaac was a miracle.

1356
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,720
 A miraculous son who was laid on the altar as a sacrifice.

1357
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,020
 That was Isaac.

1358
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,520
 And yet God brought him back.

1359
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,060
 He is the heir of all things.

1360
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,740
 And he wants you.

1361
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,500
 He wants a relationship with you,

1362
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,940
 a covenant of steadfast love.

1363
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,780
 And the question is, will you say yes?

1364
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,780
 Will you go?

1365
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,880
 And will you walk by faith to be his?

1366
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,740
 What is being asked of her

1367
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,300
 is what's being asked of you by God.

1368
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,580
 God looks at us and says, I have a son.

1369
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,760
 Miraculously born.

1370
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,120
 Laid on the altar as a sacrifice for you and me.

1371
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,520
 And now he's the heir of all things.

1372
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
 And he is coming to each one of us and saying,

1373
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,280
 I want a relationship with you.

1374
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,960
 And let me encourage you as we close.

1375
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,640
 We went fast through all this.

1376
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,320
 But before you get a relationship

1377
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,040
 with a guy or a girl right,

1378
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,520
 you need to get a relationship with God right.

1379
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,120
 You need to know the love that crossed from heaven to earth

1380
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,720
 and sacrificed for you.

1381
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,720
 You need that love to change you from the inside out.

1382
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,660
 And then you link up with one of God's kids.

1383
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,820
 Enter into his family by faith in the son of God

1384
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,460
 who has sent servants like TA and Kylan and me

1385
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,980
 and so many others to tell you,

1386
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,860
 there is a son of the king,

1387
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,200
 an heir of all things who is a sacrifice for you.

1388
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,220
 Will you by faith walk with him?

1389
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,060
 And I promise you, you'll be amazed at what God does

1390
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,420
 as you walk with him by faith.

1391
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,820
 Uncertainty will abound, but he's good in it.

1392
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,820
 And when he leads you, if it be his will to the right one,

1393
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,980
 you'll rejoice.

1394
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,220
 Amen.

1395
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,340
 So father, thank you.

1396
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,660
 Thank you that you care.

1397
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,980
 Thank you that you care about our hearts.

1398
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,220
 I pray for any in this space

1399
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,900
 who's never put their faith in you, God.

1400
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,500
 This would be the day that relationship gets right first.

1401
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,420
 That there's forgiveness with you.

1402
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,260
 There's life with you.

1403
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,360
 There's hope with you.

1404
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,100
 And then God, I pray for us as we think about

1405
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
 the longings in our heart to pair off.

1406
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,360
 I pray some faith muscles might grow tonight.

1407
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,860
 And friend, I wanna encourage you.

1408
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,340
 Let's not make this just classroom, make it a lab.

1409
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,760
 Before you walk out of here,

1410
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,000
 are you willing to trust God by faith?

1411
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,500
 God, I wanna trust you with my eternal destiny.

1412
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,700
 I wanna walk with Jesus.

1413
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,100
 And God, I wanna trust you with my Friday night.

1414
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,820
 I'm not gonna compromise with someone that I know

1415
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,980
 doesn't care about you.

1416
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,780
 God, I don't wanna settle.

1417
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,900
 I wanna walk by faith.

1418
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,260
 I don't wanna walk with someone by faith.

1419
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,780
 I'm scared of the uncertainty,

1420
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,020
 but I wanna live by faith.

1421
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,320
 Some of you just need to offer up to him

1422
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,560
 your dating life, your desires,

1423
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,500
 and say, God, I wanna take the next step

1424
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,780
 to be someone who walks with purity and holiness and faith

1425
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,500
 with a God who moved all of history to send his son

1426
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,980
 and is moving me now to walk with him.

1427
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,900
 Will you trust him?
