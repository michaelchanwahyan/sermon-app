[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.520]   You are.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.020]   You're everything to me.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.520]   Oh.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.020]   You are.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.520]   You are my one.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.020]   You are my one.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   No one else but you, Lord.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.520]   No one else but you, Lord.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   Oh, you are my one.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   Oh.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.020]   All of my heart is yours.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.520]   All of my heart is yours.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   Give me Jesus.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.020]   Give me Jesus.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:35.520]   Oh, you can have all this world.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   You can have all this world.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   Everything we need is in Jesus.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   Oh, everything we need is in Jesus.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:59.520]   Oh, everything I need is in you.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   I don't have to look to the left or to the right.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   I just gotta lift my eyes into the hills where my hope comes from.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   Yes.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.020]   I give you everything.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   We give you everything.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.520]   Come on, let that be your prayer tonight.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   Just offer your heart to him once again.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.020]   Once again, as if it were the first time, Father, we surrender our hearts to you.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.020]   We surrender everything, our lives, our desires.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   Everything we've ever wanted doesn't even come close to the fulfillment we find in you, in fellowship with you.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.020]   Communion with you satisfies everything.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   It's the fulfillment of who we are.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.520]   It's just to know you, to love you, Lord.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.020]   Tonight, we just once again give you our attention.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:11.020]   Once again, we give you our worship, our focus, our hearts, everything to Jesus.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   [music]
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.020]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.020]   I give you my soul.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:30.020]   I live for you alone.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:39.020]   Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.020]   Lord, have your way.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.020]   Sing it again, Lord, I give you.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.020]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   I give you my soul.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:01.020]   I live for you alone.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:10.020]   Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:18.020]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:26.020]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:36.020]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:47.020]   Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   I have decided that there's only one found worthy.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:01.020]   Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   Oh, I've decided that there's only one found worthy.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:15.020]   Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:23.020]   Oh, I've decided that there's only one found worthy.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   Yes, there's only one found worthy.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   His name is Jesus.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.020]   There's only one found worthy.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.020]   Mm.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   And I am an instrument of exaltation.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:56.020]   I was born to live the name above all names.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:04.020]   And you hear the melody of all creation.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.020]   But there's a song of praise that only I can bring.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   Come on, sing it.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.020]   Sing who else is worthy?
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.020]   Who else is worthy?
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.020]   There is no one.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   It's only you, Jesus.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.020]   Oh, who else is worthy?
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.020]   Who else is worthy?
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   In all the world.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.020]   There is no one.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.020]   It's only you, Jesus.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.020]   It's only Jesus.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.020]   I've decided that it's only Jesus.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   I've decided.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:22:00.020]   'Cause you are the infinite God of the ages.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:07.020]   And yet you chose to make my heart your dwelling place.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.020]   And you healed my brokenness.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.020]   And showed me your glory.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:20.020]   So I have songs of faith that even angels sing.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.020]   Oh, who else is worthy?
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.020]   Who else is worthy?
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   There is no one.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   It's only you, Jesus.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.020]   Oh, who else is worthy?
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.020]   Who else is worthy?

[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.020]   There is no one.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.020]   It's only you, Jesus.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.020]   Who else, who else?
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.020]   And who else is worthy?
