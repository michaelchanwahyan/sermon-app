1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,320
 - What's up Dallas, how's it going?

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,640
 Hey, my name is Garrett.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,040
 It's really nice to see you guys this evening.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,600
 I'm normally hanging out at the Fort Worth campus

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,440
 on Tuesday nights.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,760
 It's great to be your guest tonight.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,200
 I wanna welcome everyone who's tuning in,

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,640
 not only in Fort Worth, but in Houston, El Paso,

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,440
 around the country, and even around the world.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,800
 It's great to have you guys with us tonight.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,760
 We're finishing up our series called The Remnant tonight.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,920
 It's been a great ride,

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,080
 and we're gonna finish it tonight.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,040
 I'm gonna start with a little story here.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,240
 When I was in college, I worked at the rec center.

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,080
 Why?

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,900
 Because I could get a job there.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,760
 That's why I worked at the rec center.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,680
 It was pretty straightforward.

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,560
 I basically stood around in the weight room.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,400
 That's what I did.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,220
 That was my job.

24
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,800
 Got paid 8.50 an hour, it was fabulous.

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,880
 So I was standing around the weight room,

26
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,920
 and I started to notice this guy starts coming around.

27
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
 We were all college students.

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
 The staff was college students.

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,920
 The people coming, clients were college students,

30
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,740
 all that good stuff.

31
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,340
 So this guy is coming around,

32
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,400
 and he's noticeable because he's way too buff.

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,180
 He's one of these guys that got the one back here

34
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,200
 that normal people don't have.

35
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,880
 He's got muscles everywhere.

36
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
 It's kind of crazy.

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
 And it was kind of a boring job,

38
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,320
 so the rumor mill was the most exciting thing about the job.

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
 And so I heard that one of the girls on staff liked this dude.

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
 And so I went up, and I was like,

41
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,080
 "Hey, I heard somebody's got a little crush,"

42
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,640
 'cause I was mature like that.

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,720
 And she said, "Well, I did like him, but then he talked."

44
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,860
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,380
 No offense against some of you buff dudes.

46
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,820
 I'm sure you're great conversationalists

47
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,860
 and very sophisticated,

48
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,840
 but this one of your brothers was not.

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,260
 She said, "Yeah, I did kind of like him,

50
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,220
 "but then he talked."

51
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,060
 I was like, "What do you mean?

52
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,900
 "I mean, it couldn't have been that bad."

53
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,740
 She was like, "Yeah, he was kind of obsessed with himself,

54
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,880
 "and he kind of talked about himself a lot,

55
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,260
 "and just kind of boring overall, honestly."

56
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,740
 So the relationship was kind of over before it started.

57
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,180
 She liked what she saw from afar,

58
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,660
 but she didn't like what he had to say.

59
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,060
 I know some of you had that experience.

60
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,780
 Like you saw somebody either across the room

61
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,540
 or maybe online, and you were like, "Yes."

62
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,940
 And then you talk to them, and you're like, "No, I'm out."

63
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,420
 (audience laughing)

64
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,100
 And I'm starting right there because as it relates to God,

65
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,260
 some people I think hear about God,

66
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,500
 and they think, "Oh, that's a great idea.

67
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,620
 "I could be in with God.

68
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,780
 "That would be amazing."

69
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,940
 And then they hear what he has to say,

70
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,020
 and they're like, "Oh, I don't know about that part.

71
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,860
 "I'm not sure."

72
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,020
 He says, "What about sex?"

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,260
 He said, "What about marriage?"

74
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,340
 He said, "What about purity?"

75
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,460
 He says, "What about alcohol?"

76
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,180
 He says, "What about modesty again?

77
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,060
 "Can you speak into my good ear?"

78
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,940
 No, I'm out completely.

79
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,100
 For lots of people, God sounds like a really good option,

80
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,940
 like a good idea.

81
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,980
 Maybe you guys could get along or hit it off,

82
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,360
 but then when you hear the reality

83
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,700
 of some of what he has to say, it's over.

84
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,540
 And you know, for a lot of us,

85
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,980
 I know that we have a conflicted relationship with the Bible.

86
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,940
 Maybe you've seen people actually use the Bible

87
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,080
 to control people.

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,300
 Maybe you've seen the Bible used for harm and not for good.

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,980
 Maybe you've seen it misused, abused, misquoted,

90
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,060
 taken out of context, used to subjugate a people group,

91
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,220
 maybe subjugate a gender,

92
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,060
 maybe especially ostracize a certain group of people

93
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,100
 who are attracted to the wrong gender.

94
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,500
 You might've seen the Bible misused

95
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,960
 in all kinds of crazy ways.

96
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,420
 And for you, for that reason,

97
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,560
 or maybe for some other reason

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,620
 that I'm not creative enough to come up with on my own

99
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,820
 ahead of time, for whatever reason, for you,

100
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,860
 maybe you heard that God talked about himself too much.

101
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,860
 But for whatever reason, for you,

102
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,980
 the relationship was over before it even started.

103
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,600
 Not because God didn't seem like a good idea,

104
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,500
 but because he didn't like what he had to say.

105
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,820
 Or maybe just because other people

106
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,980
 didn't rightly represent what he really had to say.

107
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,100
 And tonight, what I wanna tell you

108
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,520
 is that the remnant always takes God at his word.

109
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
 They don't misinterpret and target others with his word.

110
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,780
 What they do is they always take God at his word,

111
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,100
 and they hid the true meaning of a loving God's words.

112
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
 Tonight, I'm gonna talk to you about the Bible.

113
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,380
 Why the remnant, the people of God who remain on earth,

114
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,340
 that's what the remnant means,

115
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,020
 the people of God who remain on earth

116
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,280
 are always devoted to the Bible.

117
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,660
 Everywhere these people go,

118
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,140
 the Bible seems to follow along with them.

119
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,020
 The people of God have always been devoted

120
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,060
 to the words of God.

121
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,840
 There's no such thing for the people of God to say,

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,620
 "Oh, I'll take God, but I'll just not take the content

123
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,460
 "of what he has to say."

124
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,240
 That wouldn't work in a relationship with you,

125
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,780
 and it won't work in a relationship with God.

126
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,380
 So tonight, as we finish this series, The Remnant,

127
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,860
 I wanna give you an experience-tested warning

128
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,540
 that if you fail to take God at his word,

129
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,740
 you're gonna end up trying to come to God on your own terms,

130
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,260
 you're gonna end up critiquing God with your own agenda,

131
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,060
 and you might even dismantle or leave behind

132
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,480
 or tear apart your own faith.

133
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,940
 Now, I'm saying that as an experience-tested warning

134
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,060
 because for the first 20 years of my life,

135
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,820
 I didn't really try to apply the Bible.

136
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,460
 The first two decades of my life, basically,

137
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,620
 I didn't really want anything to do

138
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,740
 with actually volunteering to try to follow Jesus.

139
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,700
 I wasn't really into that.

140
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,300
 That wasn't me, and I know if it's your first time

141
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,560
 and you walk in here and you look around

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,500
 and everything is church and everything is Jesus,

143
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,940
 and it just seems like we're not missing a beat up here,

144
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,380
 and then the guy walks up with the Bible,

145
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,500
 and we don't know each other,

146
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 and maybe you would just assume

147
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,420
 that I always tried to walk with God.

148
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
 I'm pointing to my Bible.

149
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,100
 If you can't see on the camera, I'm pointing to my Bible.

150
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,300
 You may not have guessed

151
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,740
 that I didn't walk with God for a long, long time.

152
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,020
 I wasn't off to a head start

153
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,620
 when I wanted to walk with Jesus for the first time.

154
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,940
 I was buried in sexual immorality and self-obsession.

155
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,140
 I was narcissistic.

156
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,020
 It was all about me all the time.

157
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,780
 I was addicted to pornography,

158
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,660
 and I was available for sexual misconduct,

159
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,340
 kind of however the party would make it available to me.

160
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,180
 That's where I was at.

161
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,780
 That's where I was living, and the Bible,

162
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,620
 I wanna tell you this.

163
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,700
 I'm giving you my bias up front.

164
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,260
 I'm a Bible person now because the Bible changed me

165
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,660
 from what I just described to something different.

166
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,180
 Not a perfect person, but a person who's on the right track.

167
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,620
 I'm telling you, I am a changed person

168
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,060
 because of the Bible.

169
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,380
 That happened in my life.

170
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,100
 What happened was I was at the start of college

171
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
 in the situation that I just described,

172
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,220
 and what happened, I picked a couple verses.

173
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,020
 I said, "Well, I got two problems here, it seems to me.

174
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,900
 "I wanna follow Jesus for the first time in my life,

175
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,700
 "but I'm buried in sexual sin, and I'm completely prideful,

176
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,880
 "and I think about myself more than I would ever wanna admit

177
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,140
 "or want anybody to know,"

178
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,600
 even though they probably already did.

179
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,540
 And I picked two verses to memorize

180
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,780
 and try to help my way through.

181
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,860
 I couldn't memorize the Bible.

182
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,900
 I couldn't memorize a chapter.

183
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,980
 Couldn't memorize a book.

184
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,140
 I could memorize two verses, so I went.

185
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,020
 I found 1 Corinthians 6, 18.

186
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,060
 It says, "Flee from sexual immorality.

187
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,180
 "All other sin a man commits are outside his body,

188
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,260
 "but whoever sins sexually sins against his own body."

189
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,800
 And I started to recall that to mind

190
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,740
 whenever I was tempted,

191
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,980
 which was often daily in the early days.

192
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,220
 And I would recall it to mind,

193
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,060
 and I committed that I was gonna recall it to mind

194
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,040
 every time I was tempted.

195
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
 Why?

196
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,700
 Because at the end of the day,

197
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,540
 I would only have two options.

198
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,980
 I could either conform my behavior to that verse,

199
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,480
 or I could quit repeating the verse.

200
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,540
 But as long as I held onto God's word,

201
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,380
 my life would eventually have no choice but to change.

202
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,840
 And God led me out step by step.

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,580
 My life changed because of that single verse,

204
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,180
 those two or three sentences.

205
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,740
 I went and found another verse on pride, Proverbs 16, 18.

206
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,840
 You might've heard it quoted before.

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,800
 It says, "Pride goes before destruction,

208
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,220
 "a haughty spirit before a fall."

209
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,340
 And it changed me.

210
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,460
 And when I was tempted to bring myself

211
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
 into the conversation

212
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,200
 and slightly give myself a little self-compliment

213
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,660
 or just think about myself too much,

214
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,220
 all of a sudden that verse allowed me to press that down

215
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
 and think about others.

216
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,780
 And I experienced some freedom and some joy.

217
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,380
 And for me, whenever I turned my life over the Bible,

218
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,580
 this sounds crazy to me.

219
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,860
 It's wild that I'm up here telling you this,

220
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,580
 but my testimony is that when I gave myself to the Bible,

221
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,540
 and when I stopped just going through the Bible

222
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,180
 and I let the Bible go through me,

223
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,180
 my life changed and I was more fulfilled, not less,

224
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,300
 which shocked me.

225
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
 The Bible says, "I will run in the way of your commandments

226
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,920
 "when you enlarge my heart."

227
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,320
 Not when you shrink my desire or make me boring.

228
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,880
 It says, "I will run in the way of your commandment

229
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,180
 "when you enlarge my heart."

230
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,200
 That happened to me.

231
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,680
 So I just wanna give you my bias up front.

232
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,900
 I'm not gonna try to sneak around

233
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,040
 and without you knowing it,

234
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
 get you to wanna read the Bible.

235
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,640
 I'm telling you up front, I want you to read the Bible.

236
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,920
 I believe it will change you the way that it has changed me.

237
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,800
 And I want you to see tonight a group of guys

238
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,480
 who go up to Jesus and they missed it.

239
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
 They just missed it.

240
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,280
 I don't want you to miss it.

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
 What they chose to do was they tried to come to God

242
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,980
 on their own terms.

243
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,780
 They got really choosy with the Bible

244
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,980
 and they critiqued God from their own agenda.

245
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,520
 And then eventually they dismantled

246
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,400
 or walked away from their own faith.

247
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
 Here we go.

248
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,280
 It's in Matthew chapter 22.

249
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,220
 Matthew is a biography of Jesus.

250
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,880
 It's written by an eyewitness of Jesus himself.

251
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
 His name was Matthew.

252
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,880
 He was a follower of Jesus.

253
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,960
 Jesus walked up to Matthew one day and said, "Follow me."

254
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,040
 That's earlier in this book.

255
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,280
 Jesus followed, or rather,

256
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Matthew followed Jesus for three years,

257
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,320
 before writing down the eyewitness account

258
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,840
 that we're about to see tonight.

259
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,060
 And this little exchange that's about to take place,

260
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,600
 you will see why the scripture is so important

261
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,320
 to the people of God in every age, always, always, always.

262
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
 So here comes Matthew chapter 22.

263
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,800
 That same day, here's a group of people

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
 you might not have met before.

265
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
 They're crucial to the story.

266
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,360
 That same day, the Sadducees,

267
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,900
 who say there is no resurrection,

268
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,280
 came to him with a question.

269
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,400
 Now, you need to know a little bit about the Sadducees.

270
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,960
 They are a group of the people of God.

271
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
 They're part of the remnant.

272
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
 The Sadducees are a part of the nation of Israel.

273
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,600
 So before God ever sent Jesus

274
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,440
 to bless the world and represent God,

275
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,880
 he sent a nation to represent God and bless the world,

276
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,720
 Israel.

277
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,760
 That was the history and the way God wanted this to unfold.

278
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,440
 And so at this point, the Sadducees are a legitimate part

279
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,040
 of the people of God, except only one problem.

280
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,840
 They don't believe what the people of God

281
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
 have always believed in.

282
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,320
 And this resurrection is not the resurrection of Jesus.

283
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,160
 That wouldn't happen until a few weeks later.

284
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,360
 This resurrection is the resurrection we call heaven.

285
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,840
 'Cause we're all agreed, no matter what your worldview is,

286
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,120
 we all have an earthly death.

287
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,040
 But the people of God believe that the people of faith

288
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,660
 will be raised again to eternal life, never to die again.

289
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,800
 And these people don't believe in heaven.

290
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
 So this is a contradiction.

291
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,040
 Here's what Matthew just said.

292
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,640
 He basically just said something like this.

293
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
 Then the Navy Seals, who don't believe in swimming,

294
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
 came to Jesus with a question.

295
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,360
 It doesn't work that way.

296
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,520
 So these guys are a walking contradiction.

297
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,760
 They got choosy with what they wanted to believe.

298
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
 I don't know why they didn't wanna believe

299
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,760
 in a literal heaven.

300
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,600
 I have no idea.

301
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,380
 To me, it would seem convenient to wanna believe

302
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,840
 in a literal heaven anyway,

303
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,300
 not to mention that it's reality.

304
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,920
 The Bible doesn't tell us why they didn't believe.

305
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,560
 Maybe it was considered unsophisticated.

306
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,240
 Maybe they would have been looked down on.

307
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,160
 They were a very academic crew.

308
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,440
 So maybe they would have been laughed at.

309
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,800
 Maybe it would have been considered unscientific.

310
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,880
 I have no idea.

311
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,040
 The Bible doesn't specify, but for whatever reason,

312
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,920
 these people got choosy with what they wanted to believe,

313
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,360
 and that's where it starts for them.

314
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,420
 You ever tried to get choosy with the Bible?

315
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,500
 What you wanted to believe, what you didn't wanna believe?

316
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,800
 You ever treat the Bible like a Chipotle line?

317
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,640
 (congregation laughing)

318
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,520
 Walking through, a little bit of that,

319
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,720
 none of that, ooh, that, yes, that.

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
 You ever done that?

321
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,520
 Sounds a little bit like this.

322
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,400
 God works all things together for the good.

323
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,320
 Yes, put that in my bowl.

324
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,160
 In this world, you will have trouble.

325
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,040
 Not my bowl, that's for the next guy.

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,240
 Don't need that.

327
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,880
 Eat, drink, and be merry.

328
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,080
 Yes, two times, one, two.

329
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,660
 Do not get drunk with wine.

330
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,160
 Pass, hard pass.

331
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,080
 Getting choosy with the Bible.

332
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
 These are Bible verses, I'm quoting them to you.

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,020
 They were naked and unashamed.

334
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
 (congregation laughing)

335
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,300
 Flee from sexual immorality.

336
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,360
 You don't want that one.

337
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
 God will give you the desires of your heart.

338
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
 Oh, that's me.

339
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
 Go to all nations.

340
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,880
 Ooh, that's somebody else.

341
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
 Maybe on vacation, I'll go to all nations.

342
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,360
 You know what I mean?

343
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,520
 (congregation laughing)

344
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
 And before you know it,

345
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,520
 we're just getting choosy with the Bible.

346
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
 We're going through like we get to pick what reality is.

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,760
 And it doesn't work that way.

348
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,600
 And when you do that,

349
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,460
 you're trying to come to God on your own terms.

350
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,560
 And you end up inconsistent anyway.

351
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,520
 Some of you this week, because you think this way,

352
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,300
 you looked at your calendar,

353
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,840
 you had this conversation in your head.

354
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,720
 What am I gonna do Tuesday?

355
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
 Porch.

356
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,120
 What am I gonna do Wednesday?

357
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,180
 Fourth of July.

358
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,080
 Maybe I'll be in a boat with some adult beverages, plural.

359
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,540
 All right, and some of you are literally intending

360
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,920
 to get hammered tomorrow within 24 hours.

361
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,800
 Like you plan to come in this room

362
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,080
 and then you plan to go to some party

363
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
 and act like everybody else who doesn't know God.

364
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 You're getting choosy with your faith.

365
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
 You'll always end up inconsistent

366
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
 when you get choosy with the Bible.

367
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,040
 This happened to me one time, I'm pretty ashamed.

368
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,360
 In those early days of me walking with Christ

369
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,720
 or not doing it very well.

370
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,280
 I was at a party, I was 21.

371
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,080
 I'd been a believer for a little while

372
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,360
 and wasn't doing that good of a job of acting like one.

373
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
 So I was at a party.

374
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,720
 I was pretty much at that point uncomfortable in church

375
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,820
 because I would hear things like this.

376
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,500
 And then I was also uncomfortable in the party

377
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,120
 because I knew I didn't really belong there either.

378
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,220
 I was just half in, half out.

379
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,720
 I was kind of miserable.

380
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,040
 And so I was at the party doing my best to ignore God

381
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,120
 and act like I wasn't a believer and just get hammered.

382
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,920
 And one of the girls came up to me that was at the party.

383
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,760
 We went to college together.

384
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,040
 She came up to me and she said,

385
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
 "Hey, I thought you were one of the God guys."

386
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,500
 And she was for real.

387
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,520
 She wasn't making fun of me.

388
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,760
 She wasn't trying to jab at me.

389
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,640
 She was sincerely confused.

390
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,320
 She just came up.

391
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,160
 I think she actually said,

392
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
 "Boy, hey, I thought you were one of the God boys."

393
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,080
 Man, I don't even know where she is,

394
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,980
 but I hope that she is not still confused

395
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,140
 because of my behavior back then

396
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,120
 because I was acting like the Bible was a Chipotle line.

397
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,400
 And it never works out well for you,

398
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,740
 for your conscience, for your future,

399
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,080
 and certainly not for the reputation of God.

400
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
 What you do tomorrow night matters.

401
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,760
 What you do tonight matters.

402
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,280
 Can't get choosy with the Bible.

403
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,920
 Now watch what they do in this conversation.

404
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,360
 The conversation hasn't even started yet.

405
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
 Watch what they're about to do.

406
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,660
 They are about to do something completely off subject,

407
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,840
 random, it is gonna feel out of nowhere because it is.

408
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
 All right, listen to where they go next.

409
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,240
 Teacher, they said, "Moses told us,"

410
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,740
 Moses was 1,500 years before this conversation.

411
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,520
 Moses was an Old Testament author.

412
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,840
 "Moses told us that if a man dies without having kids,

413
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,020
 his brother must marry the widow

414
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,620
 and raise up offspring for him."

415
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,320
 What does that have to do with anything?

416
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,880
 "Now there were seven brothers among us."

417
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,060
 We make up a little fictional story here to come to Jesus.

418
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,440
 "There were seven brothers among us.

419
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,900
 The first one married and died.

420
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,000
 And since he had no children,

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,160
 he left his wife to his brother."

422
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,120
 This was Old Testament practice.

423
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,080
 "The same thing happened to the second and third brother,

424
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,440
 right on down to the seventh."

425
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,620
 So she keeps marrying all the brothers

426
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,880
 and they just keep dying.

427
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
 "Finally, the woman died, much to the family's delight."

428
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,580
 She's wiping out the whole clan.

429
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,560
 "Finally, the woman died.

430
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,800
 Now then, at the resurrection,"

431
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,200
 now then, at the resurrection, watch this, boys,

432
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
 "in the heaven we don't believe in,

433
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,920
 whose wife will she be?

434
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,760
 Since all of them were married to her."

435
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,080
 And you go, oh, I get it.

436
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,440
 I see what's going on here.

437
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,800
 You guys are trying to make Jesus look stupid.

438
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,560
 What they just came and said was,

439
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,180
 hey, you know, Jesus in the Bible,

440
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,680
 we don't really fully believe.

441
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,680
 Moses taught us that if your brother gets married

442
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,440
 and doesn't get around to having kids and he dies,

443
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,600
 then you should marry her.

444
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,460
 But the problem is you can't have multiple wives in heaven,

445
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,520
 wrong religion.

446
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,560
 So therefore, you're dumb.

447
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,120
 That's what they just set Jesus up for

448
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,780
 right there in public.

449
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,360
 They don't take God at his word.

450
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,880
 And now they take it a step further from getting choosy.

451
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,180
 Now they're gonna critique God with their own agenda.

452
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,120
 Now they're gonna ask questions that don't even matter.

453
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
 They're gonna waste their time asking questions

454
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
 that aren't even sincere.

455
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,620
 They don't want an answer.

456
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,400
 You see that?

457
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,240
 They don't really care.

458
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,040
 You ever met someone who did that?

459
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,380
 You ever been someone who did that?

460
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,880
 I see this happen all the time.

461
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,980
 And I promise you,

462
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,140
 the issue when someone is asking an insincere question,

463
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,940
 that's really a critique.

464
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,680
 It's not that they want the answer.

465
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,800
 They just don't wanna bow down to Jesus.

466
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,640
 This conversation happens all the time.

467
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
 Hey man, what about evolution?

468
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,600
 What about you bowing down to Jesus?

469
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 What about tectonic plates?

470
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,520
 What about you bowing down to Jesus?

471
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,360
 What about Noah's Ark, man?

472
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
 How'd they get all those animals on there?

473
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,820
 What about you bowing down to Jesus today?

474
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,280
 Hey man, what about gay people?

475
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,280
 What about you, you bowing down to Jesus today?

476
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,080
 Are you asking sincerely?

477
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,920
 Hey man, what about science?

478
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,760
 What about dinosaurs?

479
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,320
 What about you bowing down to Jesus today?

480
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,400
 I don't want you to misunderstand.

481
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,880
 I'm not saying you shouldn't ask sincere questions

482
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,280
 and find great answers in the Bible.

483
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
 You should.

484
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,180
 There are answers to those questions in the Bible.

485
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,720
 You should find them.

486
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,760
 But you shouldn't ask those questions

487
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,600
 when you don't really wanna know,

488
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
 you're just throwing out smoke screens

489
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,880
 so you don't have to fall on your face

490
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
 and stop getting hammered.

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,600
 Fall down, bow down,

492
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,440
 and then ask your sincere questions from Jesus.

493
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,800
 And he will answer them for you.

494
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,200
 There are good questions to ask,

495
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 there are good answers to find.

496
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,600
 But do it from a place of sincerity.

497
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,120
 'Cause if you're just throwing smoke screens at God,

498
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,480
 he's gonna make you look dumb at some point, I promise.

499
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,680
 Watch what happens next.

500
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,520
 Before I go there, let me share one story with you.

501
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,880
 Missing the point is a bit of a tragedy.

502
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,800
 My wife and I like to travel,

503
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,520
 and we've been married a couple years now,

504
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 and everywhere we go,

505
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,200
 I've noticed as soon as we get into the hotel room,

506
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,240
 my wife likes to go to the window and look at the view.

507
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
 So that's like the first thing she likes to do.

508
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,240
 She likes to go over the window, taking the view.

509
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,760
 Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not great,

510
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,640
 you know, budget.

511
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,880
 But sometimes, every time, she walks over to the window,

512
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,800
 and I've noticed that she does this.

513
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,320
 So it's our little informal tradition.

514
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
 She'll walk to the window,

515
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,320
 and I'll just stand back and take a picture.

516
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,240
 And so I've got pictures of her

517
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,800
 looking out all kinds of hotel room windows.

518
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,880
 So here's one, so this is, you might recognize that.

519
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,040
 So there's one in Dallas, here's one in Fort Worth.

520
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,600
 It's just spread out little weekends away

521
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,960
 or whatever we're doing throughout our marriages.

522
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
 Of course, anybody recognize that?

523
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,760
 San Antonio in the house, anybody?

524
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,160
 Here's Cincinnati, beautiful, wow, look at that.

525
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,680
 Minneapolis, no offense, Cincinnati, just kidding.

526
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,520
 There's Seattle.

527
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,960
 Now look, I want you to imagine something.

528
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,360
 She's clearly there, not because of the glass,

529
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,240
 but because of what's on the other side of the glass.

530
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,600
 Now I want you to understand,

531
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,360
 how big of a mistake would I be making

532
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,400
 if I walked up to her and I was like,

533
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,960
 what is it with you and glass?

534
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,400
 (congregation laughing)

535
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
 What's your deal?

536
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,280
 I don't even like this glass.

537
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,920
 I like the glass in this other hotel better.

538
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,800
 This glass is a little thicker,

539
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
 that glass is a little thinner,

540
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
 some's a little more opaque,

541
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
 some's a little more transparent,

542
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
 some has scratches, some doesn't have scratches,

543
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,640
 some's dirty, some just got cleaned.

544
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
 Who cares about the glass?

545
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,480
 She would say, the glass is not here

546
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,520
 so you can look at it,

547
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
 it is here so you can look through it.

548
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,400
 Christians read the Bible,

549
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,880
 not just because of what we see on the page,

550
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,840
 but because we see the God who put the words there for you.

551
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,360
 The Bible is there so that you can see,

552
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,040
 not just what is there,

553
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,480
 but the one who put it there for you to find

554
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,920
 so that you could not just find words,

555
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,480
 but you could find him.

556
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,960
 The Bible is God making himself visible to you.

557
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,440
 And if you get caught up in these surface level details,

558
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,680
 I'm not saying you shouldn't ask your questions,

559
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,600
 I'm saying if that's all you ever get to,

560
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 you are going to miss the beautiful, glorious, perfect God

561
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,800
 who is staring you in the face

562
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,360
 while you look only at the glass.

563
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,480
 Don't miss the point, those guys missed it,

564
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,840
 I don't want you to miss it.

565
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,560
 Now listen to Jesus deal with this,

566
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,000
 this just makes me happy, this is just fun.

567
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
 Maybe you're not a Jesus follower,

568
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,800
 maybe you don't read the Bible a lot, this is just fun.

569
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,200
 Verse 29, Jesus replied, "You are in error."

570
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,520
 (congregation laughing)

571
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,320
 Because you do not know the Bible.

572
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,760
 Oh, here's the dirty little secret about these,

573
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,320
 here's the dirty little secret about these religious experts,

574
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,440
 they didn't know the Bible after all.

575
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,240
 And they also don't know the power of God.

576
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,720
 How many know that if you don't know God's word,

577
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,320
 you can't experience God's power?

578
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
 Will not happen, it's a channel for God's power,

579
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,040
 they're always connected.

580
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
 Verse 30, at the resurrection,

581
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
 he goes ahead and gives them an answer

582
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,240
 to their little insincere question.

583
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
 "In heaven, just so you know, people aren't married."

584
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
 Shocker, spoiler alert,

585
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,720
 "In heaven, people are not married," he says.

586
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 Marriage was for people to have a metaphor

587
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
 for how God loves humanity.

588
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,680
 Marriage is a parable for earth, that's what he says.

589
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
 But about the resurrection anyway,

590
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 have you not read what God said?

591
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
 You hear him talking about the Bible again,

592
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,360
 you hear him elevating scripture again

593
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,840
 when they're trying to press scripture down,

594
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,400
 haven't you read what God said?

595
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,640
 "I am the God," and then he quotes the Old Testament,

596
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,840
 "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

597
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 "He's not the God of the dead, but of the living."

598
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,880
 Okay, what does he mean?

599
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

600
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,720
 lived 2,000 years before this conversation.

601
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,160
 And Jesus is saying, God says, "I am," not, "I was,"

602
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,240
 "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

603
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,600
 So he tells the Sadducees,

604
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 "You should have been reading so closely in your Bible

605
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
 "that you picked up the verb tense

606
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,240
 "so that you would know that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

607
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,620
 "are alive and with God today.

608
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,560
 "Dead believers are not dead, they are with God alive."

609
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,280
 And that's what Jesus explains to these guys.

610
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,360
 And when the crowds heard this, they were astonished.

611
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
 In fact, I love the last line of the chapter,

612
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,840
 it just says, "And no one was able to answer him a word,

613
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,340
 "nor from that day did anyone dare ask him

614
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,520
 "any more questions."

615
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,080
 (congregation laughing)

616
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,580
 And here's the last punchline about the Sadducees.

617
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,720
 They didn't just try to come to God on their own terms,

618
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,860
 and they didn't just stop at critiquing God

619
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,920
 with their own agenda.

620
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,920
 They disappeared because their faith was no longer distinct.

621
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,720
 Did you know that there is no First Sadducee Church today?

622
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,360
 There is no Sadducee denomination.

623
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,960
 There are no future Sadducees of America.

624
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,600
 You cannot Google a Sadducee meeting and show up.

625
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,880
 They don't exist, it's over.

626
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,560
 In fact, they didn't even make it another 100 years.

627
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,720
 Why?

628
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,080
 Because if you get away from the Bible,

629
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,180
 you're gonna get away from your biblical beliefs.

630
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,640
 And if you get away from your biblical beliefs,

631
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,900
 you're gonna get away from the power of God,

632
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,860
 like Jesus just said.

633
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,200
 And what do you call a person who isn't close to the Bible,

634
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
 to biblical belief, or to the power of God?

635
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,820
 A non-believer.

636
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,440
 Someone who is not connected to God in any way,

637
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,160
 someone who's not part of the remnant.

638
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,980
 Do you see that?

639
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,880
 Why does the remnant stay close to the Bible?

640
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,440
 Because without it, the remnant won't remain.

641
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,080
 It's over, this is how a church dies.

642
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,200
 This is how a denomination dies.

643
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,580
 This is how a faith group dies.

644
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,200
 What they do is they get away from the Bible first,

645
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,080
 they just put it on the shelf,

646
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,160
 maybe they don't even mean to,

647
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,360
 but they put it on the shelf, it gets dusty,

648
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,100
 and then all of a sudden they start getting creative

649
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,360
 and choosy with their beliefs,

650
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
 and they take a couple key parts out,

651
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,580
 you know, who really needs a virgin birth,

652
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,440
 you know, and maybe the sexual ethic of the Bible

653
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,680
 is a little too strict,

654
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,200
 and so we'll put that one on the shelf too.

655
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,320
 And then the miracles thing, ah, that's a little much.

656
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,400
 Maybe the resurrection wasn't totally literal,

657
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,920
 and then before you know it, you've got something

658
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,960
 that doesn't even resemble Christianity.

659
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,560
 And then that group disappears.

660
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,320
 That's why we stay close to the Bible.

661
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,580
 Without the Bible, the remnant's no longer the remnant.

662
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,120
 It's over over time.

663
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,480
 The Sadducees got away from their Bibles,

664
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
 their beliefs, the power of God,

665
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,060
 and eventually they were just absorbed into culture

666
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,380
 because they became everybody else.

667
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,560
 You've gotta stay close to the Bible

668
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,960
 if you wanna remain part of the remnant.

669
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
 I'm gonna give you a really brief how.

670
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,440
 I know some of you guys are super practical

671
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
 about reading the Bible.

672
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,040
 I got one agenda tonight.

673
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,600
 I want you to see God in the Scripture,

674
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
 and I want you to enjoy Him there.

675
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
 I want you to meet Him there.

676
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,040
 I want you to see Him there.

677
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,760
 And so I'll just tell you really briefly what I do.

678
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,840
 This is not the way.

679
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
 This is not the only way.

680
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
 This is not what you should do.

681
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
 This is not what to do.

682
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,200
 This is just what I do,

683
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
 and I'm just gonna share with you what I do.

684
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,560
 This is exactly what I do every day

685
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,880
 to try to meet God in the Bible.

686
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,040
 Sometimes it goes great.

687
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
 Sometimes it's a grind.

688
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,120
 I'll just be honest with you.

689
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,400
 But this is what I do every day to meet God in the Bible.

690
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
 I open it.

691
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,000
 (congregation laughing)

692
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,600
 And I'll have a book that I'm going through,

693
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,000
 usually one chapter at a time.

694
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,840
 Sometimes I'll do more.

695
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,960
 Sometimes I'll read a chapter or two at a time

696
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
 if I wanna go a little faster,

697
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,360
 if I feel like I'm skipping past stuff,

698
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,120
 and sometimes I'll slow down and I'll read a paragraph,

699
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,960
 and that's all I'll read that entire day.

700
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,240
 And I'll read it, and I won't stop

701
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,680
 until I've answered one of these questions.

702
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
 Here they are.

703
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,040
 What do I need to do more or less of

704
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,480
 in light of what I just read?

705
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,080
 Or what do I need to feel more or less of

706
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
 in light of what I just read?

707
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,240
 Or what do I need to think more or less of

708
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,720
 in light of what I just read?

709
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
 That's it.

710
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,760
 I read until I've got an answer to one of those questions.

711
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,240
 Sometimes I don't even have to ask those questions anymore.

712
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,120
 I can see it visibly when I just start to read.

713
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,800
 What do I need to do more or less of,

714
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,200
 think more or less of, or feel more or less of?

715
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,080
 If you will, I'm gonna make you a promise

716
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,880
 that I feel is based in the Scripture where God says,

717
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
 if you base yourself in the Scripture,

718
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
 you'll be better than the rest of the people.

719
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
 If you base yourself in the Scripture,

720
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
 you'll be blessed and you will blossom

721
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,400
 like a tree planted by streams of water

722
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
 that yields its fruit in its season, Psalm 1.

723
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
 So if you will do that, if you will just do that,

724
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,480
 and every day not close the Bible

725
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,300
 until you have an answer to one of those questions,

726
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,640
 what should I do, think, or feel more or less of,

727
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
 you will not recognize yourself in one year.

728
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
 It will be different.

729
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
 That's what I do in God's Word.

730
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
 That's it.

731
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,320
 And then I got this other little book.

732
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
 This is my journal.

733
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,980
 You have to do this.

734
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,400
 No, remember, this is just what I do.

735
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,620
 You don't have to do this at all.

736
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,360
 So in my journal, I just pray.

737
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,920
 Sometimes I just give thoughts.

738
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,000
 This is where I live my emotional life in front of God.

739
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,080
 I just write stuff down.

740
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,260
 It's stream of consciousness.

741
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,100
 It's not a sermon.

742
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,920
 It's not pretty.

743
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
 It's not good.

744
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,560
 And all my frustrations and desires and insecurities

745
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,480
 and fears are right here all poured out before God.

746
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,600
 So I hope the camera guy's not zooming in too close.

747
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,040
 (congregation laughing)

748
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,860
 This is what I do.

749
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,000
 After I read, I just go right here

750
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,640
 and I just start to write every day.

751
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,280
 And yes, I do black on the left, blue on the right

752
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,080
 'cause I've got a little OCD and it calms me down.

753
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,480
 So I do blue on the right, black on the left.

754
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
 That's what I enjoy.

755
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
 (congregation laughing)

756
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,120
 And I just live my emotional life honestly in front of God.

757
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,480
 That's what I do every day.

758
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,600
 Sometimes it takes 15 minutes.

759
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,400
 Sometimes it takes an hour.

760
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,440
 Sometimes I don't have an hour

761
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,040
 and it happens in 15 minutes anyway

762
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,120
 'cause that's what I got.

763
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
 I'm a human being trying to engage with God

764
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,480
 in the midst of a 21st century world just like you.

765
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
 That's how I do it.

766
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,760
 As you can tell, it doesn't have to be perfect.

767
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,400
 What you don't need is a technique.

768
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,440
 What you need is to see God past the glass.

769
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,040
 That will keep you in the Bible.

770
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,280
 What version should you read?

771
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,660
 The version you will read.

772
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,560
 That's the one you should go get.

773
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,840
 I'll finish here tonight.

774
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
 A couple of weeks ago,

775
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,800
 I guess it was a couple months ago now, sorry.

776
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,640
 I walked up to a guy that I'd never met before

777
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,120
 at the porch in Fort Worth.

778
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,480
 And I'll never forget our first interaction

779
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,160
 because it was a good one and he had an unusual name.

780
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
 His name is Misael.

781
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,320
 He's a friend of mine at this point.

782
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
 I'd never met him before.

783
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
 And I asked him if he had a faith and he said, yeah,

784
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,560
 I'm a Christian, I've been around the church.

785
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,600
 And we kind of parted ways and didn't interact much,

786
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,680
 just welcomed him to the porch

787
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,920
 and told him I was glad he was here.

788
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,760
 And he said he was having fun and I was glad for it.

789
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,640
 Well, a couple of months later, we ran back into each other.

790
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,020
 And he communicated that he wanted to start

791
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,560
 taking his next steps with God.

792
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,080
 And I said, okay, let's do that, man.

793
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,040
 Let's start to get together.

794
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,520
 And so what happened was we started to meet regularly,

795
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,600
 twice a month.

796
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,440
 And our first meeting, we walked through the gospel

797
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,240
 that God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die on a cross

798
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,280
 so that you, by grace through faith,

799
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,680
 can receive the free gift of relationship with God.

800
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
 I said, do you believe all of that?

801
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,600
 He said, yes, I believe all that.

802
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,160
 And I said, okay, man, that's great.

803
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,080
 He got baptized.

804
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,840
 Then at our next meeting, he comes in and he was like,

805
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,480
 man, I'm discouraged already.

806
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,120
 I said, what happened, man?

807
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,040
 You just got baptized, man?

808
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,560
 You're on a high, everything's going great?

809
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,680
 He's like, man, not really.

810
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,160
 I'm just, I'm feeling kind of discouraged.

811
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,000
 I said, well, let me ask you this.

812
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
 Do you have a, do you read the Bible?

813
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,440
 Do you have like an ongoing relationship

814
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,740
 with God through the Bible?

815
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,200
 Is that peace in place for you at this point?

816
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,500
 And he said, no, man, I don't read that myself.

817
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,580
 You know, I listen to others preach it,

818
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,160
 but this, it's just not something I do.

819
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,280
 And I said, okay, well, I'll tell you what.

820
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,380
 Let's have you and I read it together every day.

821
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,800
 We'll read one chapter of the book of John per day,

822
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,780
 21 chapters.

823
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,000
 It's a biography of Jesus.

824
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,080
 It's a three-week challenge.

825
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,400
 You and I will read it every day,

826
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,160
 and we will text each other one takeaway,

827
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,200
 similar to what I said before.

828
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,080
 I said, would you be up for that?

829
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
 He said, yes, absolutely.

830
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,120
 Day 12, he texted me this.

831
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,200
 I'm gonna read it to you with permission.

832
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
 This was just between he and us.

833
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,660
 This wasn't for a sermon illustration.

834
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,720
 You got to understand, this is reality, all right?

835
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,040
 This is just a conversation between a friend and I.

836
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,840
 Two weeks in, he says, you have no clue

837
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,400
 what the book of John has done to me,

838
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,440
 three exclamation points, smiley face.

839
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,960
 It has opened up building blocks of stories

840
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,080
 for me to share with my daughter, exclamation mark.

841
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,480
 My family, exclamation mark.

842
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,920
 My friends, exclamation mark.

843
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
 To build my faith and believe,

844
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,800
 and this is just the beginning, five exclamation marks.

845
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
 This is a dude, people, all right?

846
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
 He is fired up, all right?

847
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,600
 I'm telling you.

848
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,720
 John chapter 20, three days ago, not for a sermon,

849
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,040
 just because he and I are reading together,

850
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,640
 and it's encouraging both of us.

851
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,560
 Three days ago, he texts me.

852
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,960
 It's my first time reading about Jesus's death.

853
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,520
 All my years in the church,

854
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,360
 never read it for myself until today.

855
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,920
 I've always heard the sermons,

856
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,000
 but reading it does more healing of the heart and spirit

857
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,640
 than hearing it from someone else.

858
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,420
 If you just read it for yourself, his words.

859
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,520
 I called him a couple hours ago,

860
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,280
 just asked him if I could share that.

861
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,120
 I didn't know I was gonna cry,

862
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
 so he's probably embarrassed in Fort Worth right now.

863
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,440
 (congregation laughing)

864
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,000
 I said, "Hey, man, can I share that?"

865
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,960
 And he said, "Yes."

866
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,200
 And I said, "Man, is there anything else you want me to say?"

867
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,880
 He said, "Yeah, just tell him don't do it alone.

868
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,680
 "Tell him to find somebody and help.

869
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,600
 "Tell him, find somebody and do what we're doing."

870
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
 I said, "All right, I'll tell him."

871
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
 When you open the Bible,

872
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,500
 you will find a new world that you didn't know existed.

873
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,720
 You will find yourself in the Bible

874
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,880
 worse than you thought you were.

875
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,880
 You'll find God in the Bible better than you thought he was.

876
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,440
 And it doesn't take you very long to read the Bible

877
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,600
 and realize the people there have problems.

878
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,640
 There are people in the Bible with addictions.

879
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,040
 The people in the Bible have regrets.

880
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,380
 The people in the Bible have trouble.

881
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,400
 The people in the Bible are like us.

882
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,120
 And the people who read it are like you,

883
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,620
 more than you thought.

884
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,920
 There's a God who's waiting to meet you.

885
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,320
 He's on the other side of the glass if you'll look for him.

886
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,600
 He wrote, "Reaching Out to You."

887
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,200
 It's why the Bible exists, so that he can relate to you,

888
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,520
 not just so that you can study geography

889
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,340
 and history and poetry, although if that's your thing,

890
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,140
 it'll be joyful to you in the Bible.

891
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,960
 But he didn't write it just so you could

892
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,080
 study it in that way.

893
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,040
 He wrote it so you could know him, connect with him,

894
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,160
 receive forgiveness, receive confidence

895
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,880
 that you always wanted, get rid of the insecurities

896
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,960
 that you never wanted.

897
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,160
 That's possible in the Bible.

898
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,440
 It's why it exists, it's for you.

899
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
 Let's pray together.

900
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,940
 (congregation murmuring)

901
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:15,780
 God, we believe you because we see you.

902
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,540
 God, thank you that you saw fit to write a perfect book

903
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,340
 through imperfect people, even.

904
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,140
 You gave us a text we can trust that tells us

905
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,900
 that you have a love that we can trust

906
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,060
 and a care that we can trust and a commitment to us

907
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,000
 that we can trust.

908
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,740
 God, I pray for my friends that are listening tonight

909
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,100
 that they would just connect with you in the Bible,

910
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,220
 not just learn more facts and be a smarter sinner,

911
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,260
 but they would actually connect with you

912
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,460
 and get a glimpse of you.

913
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,780
 And God, I pray that you'd remind them

914
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,740
 that Christians are not people who just commit

915
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,180
 to the Bible despite all criticism and doubt.

916
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,180
 Christians are people who happily hold the Bible

917
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,260
 because the view holds them happily.

918
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,120
 Because they can see you.

919
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,520
 We're held content in our commitment to the Bible

920
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,560
 because we can see your glory through it.

921
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,440
 Thank you that on the page of these scriptures,

922
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,800
 we see who we really are and who you really are.

923
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,640
 In Jesus' name, amen.

924
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
 In Jesus' name, amen.
