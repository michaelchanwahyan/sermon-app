00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
 All right, let's go, Porsche.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,500
 Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,100
 Y'all ready?

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,200
 Let's go!

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,000
 We are here to have a good time and we just want to go ahead and

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 start off by, like we always do, welcoming our Porsche Live

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,700
 locations.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,500
 I'm gonna let each of these guys welcome a Porsche Live location

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,800
 and make sure we show them some love in the room after each one.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,500
 So David.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,700
 Welcome, Houston, Texas.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,100
 Let's go Astros!

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,700
 Porsche Live Houston, welcome.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,800
 All of you self-righteous people about them being cheaters, like

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,500
 you've never done anything wrong in your life.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,200
 Wow, I was going to not be as excited as that.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
 You don't have to be, be you.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,900
 Okay, Austin, we love you.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,800
 We're really proud of you.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,400
 Porsche Live Austin!

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,000
 Let's go Phoenix and Boise!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
 Let's go Potatoes!

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
 Yeah, Phoenix and Boise.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,500
 And as always, our friends in the room, we're so glad you're here.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,100
 And like I said earlier, we are wrapping up the We're All Freaking

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
 Out series on mental health, anxiety, stress, worry, all the

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,600
 things.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,100
 And so we did this at Awaken just like this, pretty much, and it

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,400
 was, I mean, everyone loved it.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,100
 So, you know, we're diving in.

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,700
 You better keep making them happy.

33
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,200
 I loved it.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 I'm like, let's do it again.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,700
 At least you guys loved it.

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
 Yeah, they're all like, who?

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,300
 What? Awaken?

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
 And so, okay.

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,900
 Well, first off, I know that you have all lived in Dallas at one

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,600
 point, the only one who doesn't, JP, you're down in Waco, Texas

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,500
 now, serving at Harris Creek.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 And, but you have lived in Dallas, obviously.

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,200
 What is one restaurant?

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,700
 If y'all only got to eat at one more restaurant in Dallas, Texas,

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,800
 what would it be?

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,400
 Fuzzies.

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,700
 I've got mine.

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,400
 You said fuzzies down here.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,800
 You ready?

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,100
 What is it?

52
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,800
 Yeah, no, if I could only choose one, I would choose Macero, Mico,

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,600
 Matitos, and Velvet Taco.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
 Okay, got it.

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,900
 Got it.

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,700
 Mexican food.

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,900
 Math has never been his thing.

58
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,300
 Yeah.

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
 Okay, I never get tired of Jose's.

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,300
 Have y'all ever been there?

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,200
 The patio on a fall day.

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,300
 Zach introduced me to it.

63
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
 I know, we introduce everyone to it.

64
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
 If you go out to eat with us, we'll probably take you to Jose's.

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,200
 We are Mexican lovers.

66
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 I would say Mico Sina.

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,800
 Wow.

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
 Yeah, Mico Sina.

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,600
 Okay.

70
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,700
 And then let's go a little more on the spiritual side, and then

71
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,400
 we'll dive into the questions on mental health.

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,500
 What is, I'll ask this, what book of the Bible are you reading

73
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,200
 right now, and give us kind of like, what are you learning in

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,400
 it?

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,900
 Are you reading the Bible?

76
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,600
 No, I actually stopped.

77
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,200
 Do you read the Bible?

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 I actually stopped.

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,100
 He's in the Quran.

80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,300
 It's great, man.

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,900
 It's got some really--

82
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,300
 Running to Joseph Smith, he loves them.

83
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,800
 There's some powerful nuggets in there for sure.

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,500
 Today, this morning, I read through Mark chapter 4, and

85
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 actually I'll share this here in a second, but we was camping

86
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
 out in Mark chapter 4.

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
 And what did you learn?

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,800
 Oh, you'll share it later?

89
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,300
 Yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,500
 Okay, a foreshadowing of what's to come.

91
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,200
 Jenny?

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 So I'm actually listening to Galatians this week on Dwell

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,100
 app, and I love listening to books that I know pretty well

94
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,000
 because you hear it, and I listen in accents that are really

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,400
 interesting, and they read it differently.

96
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,600
 Oh.

97
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,300
 What accent are you on right now?

98
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
 Well, it's Felix, if you know Dwell app, and he reads it like

99
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 real African.

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,200
 It's awesome.

101
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,700
 And he just, I love him.

102
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,500
 He's real passionate.

103
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 And so he is reading it to me, and I heard in Galatians,

104
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,100
 his passion make very clear that we cannot go after any other

105
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,600
 gospel, that there is no other gospel that we can live out, and

106
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
 so let's be sure we're living the true gospel.

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,500
 That's good.

108
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,000
 Yeah.

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
 Yeah, so I'm reading the Psalms in the morning, but where I'm

110
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
 camping out is in Ecclesiastes.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 We're going through that, and I think this past week has kind

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,000
 of stayed with me for a number of reasons, but it's just like

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,300
 learn from your pain before you leave it, Ecclesiastes chapter

114
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,600
 seven, and so that God, and that's so relevant to what I think

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
 where we're going tonight, which is just like God wants to teach

116
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,200
 us something in pain, and that pain is some of the greatest,

117
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,400
 pain is one of the greatest teachers under the sun, and so

118
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,200
 on this earth, it's something that he allows to happen so that

119
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
 we can grow and be sanctified.

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,000
 That's good.

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,400
 Well, I just want to kind of dive into this conversation, and

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
 I'm so glad, thank y'all for making time.

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,300
 I know that traveling and all that is crazy, especially in the

124
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,200
 middle of the week, and I think that this is a conversation

125
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,600
 that the church needs to be having more because people are

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,500
 having it, and they're looking for a place to look for answers,

127
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,800
 and I hope that it's always the church.

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,900
 I hope that the church can become more and more of a safe place

129
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,400
 for people to be honest with what they're feeling, experiencing,

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,800
 and to be met with love and truth, and so I hope that tonight

131
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,700
 is a really helpful resource in this conversation, and so just

132
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,300
 starting off, because anxiety, mental health, all of these

133
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,400
 things seem to be plaguing the world, and everyone kind of is

134
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,200
 talking about it, but it is kind of this like lofty idea that

135
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,900
 people don't really know how to articulate. Before we try to

136
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,200
 talk about anxiety itself, where do you, where do y'all feel

137
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,500
 like, and anyone can answer, we can go, each of you, where do

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,600
 y'all feel like it is stemming from? Like what are the leading

139
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,200
 causes today of anxiety, depression, stress, worry, all

140
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
 those things?

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,500
 Well, we live in a very disconnected world. We are facing

142
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 more than ever epidemic of loneliness, of course social

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,600
 media, there's so many right answers, but I'm going to actually

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,100
 go to a way deeper place and say it's definitely strategic, that

145
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,900
 the enemy, I believe, has spiritual, I mean, you said

146
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,500
 push the envelope before we came out here.

147
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 Push it, push it.

148
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,100
 Okay, let's go, let's go.

149
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
 So I think the enemy is very strategic. You see Jesus

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,700
 talk about the enemy, he calls him a liar, and a liar is a,

151
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,000
 especially if he's a good liar, then he's thinking very hard

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 about how he lies and how he does it. And so what you've got

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,900
 is you've got a demonic force, sorry if you're new here and

154
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,100
 overwhelmed by this, but there's a demonic force working against

155
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
 us. I think it's an important thing to know as a Christian.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
 In fact, I'll start with Ephesians.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,800
 Sorry if you wanted to start lighter than that, but let's

158
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,500
 go. I figure this is a much...

159
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,200
 I'm riding into the demons.

160
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,100
 Let's go to the demons.

161
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,700
 All right, because if we don't start here, I think we're

162
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,400
 kind of missing, we're really talking about the things the

163
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,500
 demons are using, right?

164
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,100
 Like this is a plan.

165
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,400
 You want to know when everybody in the world is feeling

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
 something at the same time, do you think that's an accident?

167
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,300
 Like the whole world is collectively anxious. And Scripture

168
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,500
 says, "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his

169
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,200
 might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to

170
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,100
 stand against the schemes of the devil." That he has schemes

171
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,900
 that are coming for you. "For we do not wrestle against

172
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,100
 flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,

173
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,600
 against the cosmic forces over this present darkness." And

174
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,400
 I know that feels like an intense way to start, but if there

175
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,300
 are cosmic forces coming for us, I think we don't have another

176
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,600
 place we can start. Because there is cosmic forces coming

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
 for us, and there is a devil that is scheming how to take

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,700
 us out. And when you see, everyone you know, when I have

179
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,600
 elementary age kids that are shut down and cannot attend

180
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,000
 school because of anxiety, we have a massive problem. There

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
 is something happening in the world right now that is so

182
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,300
 thick and that is so strategic that I think we've got to

183
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,200
 realize that he's using all these different things. And it's

184
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
 true. We are disconnected. We are on our screens. We are,

185
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,400
 you know, in a world where we know the problems of the entire

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,100
 planet, and that's all troubling. But ultimately, what the

187
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,700
 enemy wants is to shut down the church. And he's doing a

188
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
 really good job, I would say.

189
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,500
 Yeah, that's good.

190
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,000
 Yeah, just add quickly, if I can, that, and I've said this,

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
 I mean, just this idea that selfishness is satanic. And so

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,200
 when we get so focused on ourselves, and we try to be God

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
 and we want glory, like we weren't made to be worshiped.

194
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,500
 Like we have to offload that onto this dirty shelf of Jesus

195
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,300
 Christ. It will collapse us if we try to be at the center of

196
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,300
 our world. And so with the enemy, the enemy doesn't need

197
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,800
 you to worship him. Like there's probably not a lot of Satan

198
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 worshippers here tonight. Like you're probably not going to

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,700
 go home and like crack open the Ouija board and do the

200
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,600
 seance thing.

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:58,200
 But if you will worship, I was like, okay, JD. But if he

202
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,100
 can get you just to focus on you, like the opposite of loving

203
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,900
 God is not loving Satan, it's loving self. And putting yourself

204
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,200
 or worshiping self rather. The opposite of worshiping God

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,400
 is worshiping self. That's why he said, just to piggyback

206
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
 on what she said, 2 Corinthians 10 5, we demolish all

207
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,100
 arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against

208
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,600
 knowledge of God. And we take every thought captive and

209
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 make it obedient to Jesus Christ. And right before that,

210
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,900
 it's talking about demonic strongholds. And so the enemy

211
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,000
 is going to try to distract you with you. When you start

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,900
 thinking about you a lot, that is the beginning of the spiral

213
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,100
 to despair.

214
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 It's good.

215
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
 I don't think I'd add any. I think we are, to her point,

216
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,500
 or one of them mentioned, we're connected in all the ways

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,400
 that produce anxiety and disconnected in so many ways

218
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,100
 that prevent anxiety. And so we're not connected in terms

219
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,500
 of relationally to others that authentically walk alongside

220
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,200
 where we can talk about the ways that we're struggling.

221
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,300
 The same problem is always causing anxiety, facing uncertainty

222
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,600
 and sitting in the place of God. And so having other people

223
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,100
 that are connected to us deeply, relationally, not on a

224
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,300
 screen, but connected in life is one of the ways that we

225
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,500
 prevent anxiety and being connected to all of the different

226
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,600
 alerts, problems, challenges, comparisons through digital

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,100
 connections, produce anxiety.

228
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,300
 So we've got really in two different directions, something

229
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,500
 happening where we're doing things that produce it and

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
 not doing the things that prevent it.

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,100
 I am.

232
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,100
 You are such teachers because you pretty much just said

233
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,700
 three points and it was Satan's self in social media.

234
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,400
 Oh, you're the teacher.

235
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,900
 You're the teacher.

236
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,700
 But okay, so JP, I'm going to ask you this because I think

237
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
 I've seen you talk about this on Instagram.

238
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,000
 There's this quote that I've heard a lot around here and

239
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,600
 then in different spaces that say, it says, "Feelings are

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,300
 real, but not reliable." And I think that sometimes I struggle

241
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,200
 with that quote.

242
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
 I'll be honest.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,500
 I get the heart of it, but feelings are God-given, emotions

244
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,300
 are God-given and they are such a gift.

245
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,000
 And I think sometimes it can sound like feelings and emotions

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
 aren't safe at all.

247
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,100
 Yeah.

248
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,600
 And I'm...yeah, she's like, "Let me finish." Okay.

249
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,800
 So what I want to know is the Bible also says, "Do not listen

250
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,600
 to your heart."

251
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,000
 Yeah.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,900
 It's wicked.

253
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,600
 It's deceitful above all else who can know its ways.

254
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,800
 And so how do we as young adults who are very much led by

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,700
 feelings, led by emotions, and we have been told that that

256
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
 could potentially cause the anxiety.

257
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,700
 How do we embrace the God-given gift of feelings and emotions,

258
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
 but also not let them be our God?

259
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,300
 Yeah.

260
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,200
 Yeah.

261
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,500
 Yeah.

262
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,100
 So I first heard that quote from Todd Wagner and then I heard

263
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
 it over time improved to say, "Feelings are real, but not

264
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
 always reliable." Because sometimes they're very reliable

265
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
 when you touch the hot stove and it says, "That's hot.

266
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
 That feels hot."

267
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,200
 You know, "Wow, it hurts." And that's a reliable feeling.

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,100
 One time just south of here, so in Preston Hollow, I was

269
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,000
 driving around and I was in the midst of the roads where

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 they're not really a grid.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,700
 They're kind of windy and I got really turned around and I

272
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,300
 was just like, "I'm like a mile from here, but I'm lost and

273
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,900
 I'm trying to get back to Watermark." And I live here right

274
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
 at the time and I've lived here for 20 years and I can't

275
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,800
 find my way out of Preston Hollow.

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,500
 And everything in me says, "I feel like Watermark is that

277
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,900
 way." And so I just start driving and eventually as I'm

278
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
 driving, I'm looking for Watermark and I'm looking for this

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
 medical tower over here.

280
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,200
 I eventually see taller buildings, which are downtown.

281
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,800
 And I'm like, "How did I get downtown?" And so, yeah, I

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 know y'all are pointing at people.

283
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,400
 You do that.

284
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:51,200
 And so what I did is I pulled out my GPS, you know,

285
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
 iMaps, Google Maps, right?

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,100
 And I put in the address and I just trusted it.

287
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,600
 And so you need to know there's going to be times where

288
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,900
 you feel deeply like he's the one, she's the one, you should

289
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,500
 do this, you should work there, you should drink that, or

290
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,200
 you should take your life, you should cut yourself, you

291
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 should end it all, you should despair, you should stay in

292
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,100
 bed. And in those moments, I would just encourage you to

293
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,300
 turn to your GPS.

294
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,700
 And here it is.

295
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,200
 I'm going to give it to you.

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,700
 Write it down.

297
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,500
 Ready?

298
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,100
 Gather your group.

299
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,500
 That's believers.

300
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,900
 My friend, Ginny Allen, has an amazing book coming out in

301
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,800
 February called Find Your People.

302
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,700
 That's what I'm saying.

303
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
 Gather your group.

304
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,400
 Not one person, not your wise uncle, followers of Jesus in

305
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,100
 your life.

306
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,000
 Okay, so gather your group.

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
 Persist in prayer.

308
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
 And so begin to pray, "Lord, I don't know where I'm

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
 going. Would you speak through them?

310
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,100
 Would you show me?

311
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,700
 Would your Holy Spirit whisper to me, the voice behind me,

312
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,800
 whether to turn right or left?" And search the scriptures.

313
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,300
 Is there a verse that, like, if I believe I should end it

314
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,800
 or I should stay in bed, but there's a verse that tells me

315
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,500
 something else, then I'm going to trust this over my feelings,

316
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,800
 right?

317
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,300
 I want to conform my feelings to what this says.

318
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,100
 So gather your group, persist in prayer, search the scriptures.

319
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
 That's your GPS.

320
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,200
 When you don't know where to go, you turn there.

321
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
 Say, "All right, I need to get my people in a room.

322
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,300
 I need to ask God to speak through them before, during,

323
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,100
 and after. And I need to ask them, is there any scriptures

324
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,500
 that align with the counsel that you're giving me?" And so

325
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
 when that aligns, when your GPS aligns with how you feel,

326
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,100
 trust it. When it doesn't, don't. Your heart is wicked and

327
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,500
 deceitful and beyond cure, but the Holy Spirit gives you a

328
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,900
 new heart, a heart of flesh, not a heart of stone.

329
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,500
 But the problem is your degenerate heart under the sun

330
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,300
 in this world, detached from God, is kind of always there.

331
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,600
 You can trust your new heart, but you can't trust your old

332
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
 heart. And that's why you have to have people in your life

333
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,300
 who will help you.

334
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,400
 Good stuff.

335
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,000
 Jenny?

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I canoe.

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
 And...

338
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
 Nice.

339
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,800
 Or do that.

340
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,300
 Just cook.

341
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,700
 I mean, thank you for your honesty.

342
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,000
 Who gets lost on a canoe?

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,300
 And she uses a GPS when she canoes.

344
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,700
 I see.

345
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,400
 I canoe.

346
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 And my husband would laugh because I'm not very good at

347
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,500
 it, but I do do it.

348
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,700
 Like, I figure...

349
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
 Claire, where do you canoe?

350
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,000
 How can you be bad at canoeing?

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,700
 I'm going to tell you because it's very...

352
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,600
 Does anyone know that you can be bad at canoeing?

353
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,900
 I am a terrible canoeer.

354
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,600
 We're going to make a support group for all you bad canoeers

355
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,200
 out there.

356
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,800
 So I am a bad canoeer, but I do canoe.

357
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
 And it is a funny word, you know.

358
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,100
 But what I would say about that is when I'm on the river and

359
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,000
 I'm canoeing, I own canoes.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,500
 I need to really brag that I really do canoe.

361
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,400
 Like, that's something I do.

362
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,300
 We got that part.

363
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 She canoes.

364
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
 She has those shirts.

365
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,500
 I canoe.

366
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,200
 You know, I felt like I was saying something that wasn't

367
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,700
 true.

368
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,800
 Okay, like I own a canoe.

369
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,200
 Okay.

370
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,900
 She got the canoe.

371
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,400
 She has a canoe.

372
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,300
 Okay.

373
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,300
 So when we canoe, we go down the river and I am horrible at

374
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,200
 it and they don't want me in the back and they don't want me

375
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 in the front, which means you're in the middle because that's

376
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,500
 the people that don't paddle.

377
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:13,600
 And so anyway, so when we're on the river, there are two

378
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,000
 options.

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,900
 There's two shores and you don't want to hit them.

380
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,100
 You want to go down the river.

381
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,200
 Okay, getting obvious.

382
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,700
 So when you're doing this, what I would say is that every

383
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,500
 single one of us, what I learned in adoption therapy before

384
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,300
 we adopted was everybody has a window of tolerance and the

385
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,500
 window of tolerance is just like that river that you are

386
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,400
 going down the river.

387
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,000
 You want to go down the river smoothly, safely, but the reality

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 is there's two shores. On one side of the river, you have

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,300
 the shore of coping, checking out, stuffing your feelings,

390
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,700
 pretending it's not happening.

391
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,800
 On the other side, you have chaos, anger, frustration, panic

392
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 attacks, losing your mind, you know, whatever.

393
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
 So you've got these two sides of the river.

394
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
 Well, all of us have a certain window of tolerance.

395
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
 Nobody has an infinite window of tolerance.

396
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,600
 There are always shores to the ability of things we can

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
 actually process and handle.

398
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,300
 The more trauma, I'm just getting really technical here,

399
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,500
 but the more trauma you've been through, the smaller that

400
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
 river is, the smaller and tighter it is.

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
 So if you've been through a lot, which let's be real, all

402
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
 of our windows of tolerance just shrunk.

403
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,100
 We have collectively been through a lot.

404
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,100
 So the river is really tight.

405
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,400
 And if you're not a good canoer, like I can't figure it

406
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
 out, I actually go the fastest and the best if I just

407
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,900
 don't paddle, like nobody paddles.

408
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,200
 We just ride the river.

409
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,000
 And I would say this actually very much applies because

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
 that is largely how we are supposed to go through this,

411
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
 is there is a sense of we really can't control our lives

412
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,500
 and we really can't control the world.

413
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,200
 And so we are all freaking out.

414
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,800
 We are.

415
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,300
 And so when we're all freaking out, there's this sense of

416
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 what do we do?

417
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,600
 And so we put our oar in and if you're like me, you hit a

418
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,300
 shore just because for some reason, every time my oar goes

419
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
 in, I go to the right or I go to the left and I'm trying

420
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,000
 to control it and I'm trying to make it work.

421
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,700
 And the harder I paddle, the more I go to the right and

422
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,400
 left. Good for you that are good at canoeing, but I'm not.

423
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,700
 And so when I do it, when I try to get involved overly

424
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,900
 in my life and try to control this thing, I'm going to

425
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,300
 the right or to the left.

426
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,700
 And what I would say is that there is a moment right now

427
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,600
 where we all have kind of put in our paddles and we're

428
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
 like, Lord, we need you.

429
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,500
 Like you're just going to have to help us get down this

430
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,000
 river. And what's cool is if you go on a good river, there

431
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 is a current and it will carry you.

432
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,600
 And I would say for all of us that are spinning right

433
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,200
 now, I mean, the reality is you are, and I want to say

434
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,000
 this as gently and kindly as I can.

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,600
 I am so sorry.

436
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 I am so sorry and you are not alone.

437
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,700
 You are not the only one that is feeling like it is

438
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
 absolute chaos.

439
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,100
 Some of you have had a panic attack today.

440
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,700
 Some of you have hit a shore in the last two hours.

441
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,800
 Like you were outside paralyzed before you came in.

442
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,600
 And I just want to say, humanly speaking, we all have

443
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 a certain amount that we can handle.

444
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,700
 And so do not be overly discouraged if you feel like,

445
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,100
 gosh, I keep hitting a shore.

446
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,500
 How you grow that window of tolerance, how you expand

447
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,900
 it and cause it to be larger, so I've learned, it's just

448
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,000
 impossible thing that you have to do is you have to

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
 be honest.

450
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,900
 You have to say out loud how hard this is.

451
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
 And for girls, some of you are better at it.

452
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
 I'm not very good at it.

453
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
 It's very hard for me.

454
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,400
 For guys, you're probably not as comfortable doing it.

455
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,300
 But what therapy has taught me is there is power in

456
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 saying it out loud to people that nod.

457
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
 I call it the universal head nod.

458
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,100
 When you say something that everybody else feels and

459
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,200
 everybody kind of sits across from you and just does

460
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,800
 this, because all of a sudden what happens?

461
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,900
 You know, you're not alone.

462
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
 You know, you're not alone.

463
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,200
 And I think, you know, I mean, I would just be curious

464
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 like how many people in here, there's a lot of people

465
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,100
 in here, have struggled with anxiety in the last year.

466
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,500
 And I want you to leave your hand up just for a minute.

467
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,800
 And I want you to feel the power of presence and the

468
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,500
 power of not being alone and how silly we are to not

469
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,000
 share that.

470
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,900
 Okay, we can put it down.

471
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,100
 How silly we are to not share it because we are in

472
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,900
 such good company.

473
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,000
 And I think most of us do.

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,500
 I don't know.

475
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,700
 Do you feel like people share it?

476
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,200
 Do you feel like people are honest about it?

477
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
 No.

478
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,200
 It's not a long answer, but no, I don't think most

479
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
 people have relationships with people around them

480
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,300
 where they are willing to open up and share, which

481
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,200
 is why we hit on community so much here that one of

482
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
 the key vehicles for transformation for widening

483
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
 that tolerance zone is authentic relationships.

484
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,900
 We just weren't made to live this life alone.

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,900
 I also think that people don't think that people

486
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,600
 care enough.

487
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,300
 Like they think, what do you care what I'm dealing

488
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,000
 with inside of here, which is sad, but I think that's

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,600
 a whole thing.

490
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,800
 Can we ask the audience?

491
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,300
 Sure.

492
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,400
 Why is it hard to share?

493
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,000
 I think it would be great to hear from you guys.

494
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,300
 Pride.

495
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,800
 Pride.

496
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,300
 Shame.

497
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:19,600
 It's vulnerable.

498
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,500
 People leave.

499
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,200
 Feeling like a burden.

500
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,600
 Feel different.

501
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,900
 You know, it's funny.

502
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,200
 None of those have in common things that are of

503
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,100
 the Spirit of God.

504
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,500
 And I don't say that to shame anyone, but shame,

505
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,200
 pride, fear, none of those have in common the Spirit

506
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,700
 of God.

507
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,300
 You know, my wife is a counselor and studies even

508
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,900
 show one of the reasons therapy is even helpful for

509
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,500
 people is just talking about it does diminish those

510
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 feelings of anxiety, kind of gets it out from this

511
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,300
 vague feeling of fear and worry and anxiety and it

512
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,000
 puts it out on the table.

513
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,300
 And so sometimes one of the healthiest thing you

514
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
 can do is just try to articulate it because sometimes

515
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,000
 we get stuck because I don't even know what I'm

516
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 feeling and just try to put words around it and

517
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,800
 articulate it.

518
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,500
 And when you do, especially with trusted other believers,

519
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,100
 you'll begin to experience more peace, some sense of

520
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,000
 deeper freedom.

521
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,700
 Yeah.

522
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,800
 Well, since we're talking about this specifically,

523
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,000
 where's the next question personally?

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,400
 I know that all three of you have talked about

525
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,600
 struggling with anxiety or depression, panic, worry,

526
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,700
 stress in some way and just let us in, maybe one or

527
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,400
 two of you, let us into whether it was a season,

528
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,300
 something current and how do you either fight it or

529
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,900
 how did you get out of that season?

530
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,200
 What does it look like for you personally?

531
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,900
 I know you just said bring people in but practically

532
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,600
 more practical.

533
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
 Yeah, say it out loud.

534
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,400
 I think is, you know, I went through this season where

535
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,300
 I was, I would have a panic attack even around speaking

536
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,600
 and this is my job.

537
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,800
 And so it feels like, like my livelihood is going

538
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,500
 out the window and this thing that God called me

539
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,100
 to do.

540
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,800
 And when I talked to an expert, you know, who was an

541
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,500
 expert, he just said you should just tell them that,

542
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
 like you should just say that.

543
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,900
 And so I learned about something called cognitive

544
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,200
 behavioral therapy, which if you go to someone to

545
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,800
 treat anxiety, there's two roads.

546
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
 There's medicine and there's therapy and medicine

547
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,900
 works really well for some people and therapy works

548
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,200
 really well for some people.

549
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,400
 And so I was in the therapy camp that was very

550
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,800
 helpful to me and it was interesting what this

551
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,200
 therapist prescribed to me was, and he wasn't a

552
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,600
 Christian, which you know, that's just where I was

553
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,700
 that day, you know, the life raft was this guy who

554
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,600
 wasn't a Christian, but he knew that I very much

555
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,500
 was and, or I am, and he's still a Christian.

556
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 And it's good news.

557
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,100
 It's good news.

558
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,900
 And he was just like, hey, just you should meditate,

559
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,300
 you should dwell on a thought.

560
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,700
 You should focus deep into it.

561
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,000
 He's like, you know, you know what you do.

562
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
 I think you call it prayer.

563
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,600
 And I was like, that's so fascinating that what this

564
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
 guy, the latest greatest start of the state of the

565
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,900
 art treatment was really something David did 3000

566
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
 years ago.

567
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 God prescribed 4000 years ago, right?

568
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,100
 I meditate on your law day and night.

569
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,000
 It is like honey.

570
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,600
 And just if you think about Paul in the New Testament

571
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,300
 in Philippians 4, he says, do not be anxious about

572
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,300
 anything, but in everything by prayer and petition

573
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 with thanksgiving, present your request to God and

574
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,900
 the peace of God, which transcends all understanding

575
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,000
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ

576
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,600
 Jesus.

577
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,200
 And I've heard David teach this even recently.

578
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
 He's not saying don't be anxious because that's

579
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,200
 not helpful.

580
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,100
 He's saying don't be anxious without prayer.

581
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,800
 And if you think about what he's saying, saying

582
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,200
 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything

583
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,400
 by prayer, which is prayer and petition, which is

584
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
 prayer with thanksgiving, which is prayer.

585
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,900
 He says don't be anxious, but pray, pray, pray.

586
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,600
 And we think, oh man, like, yeah, you know, preacher

587
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
 man, you're supposed to say that like band-aid on

588
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
 my wound and it's like, but no, no, like deep

589
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
 contemplative prayer actually heals both because

590
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,900
 God responds to prayer, but also we were made for

591
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,500
 prayer.

592
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,100
 And like we right now we don't have time for prayer.

593
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,500
 This thing is the enemy of prayer.

594
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
 Like it hates prayer.

595
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,400
 Satan is using this to destroy your prayer life.

596
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
 Like, like I don't know how many, like how many

597
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,900
 of you by show of hands, like prayed for more than

598
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,600
 30 minutes straight today.

599
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,300
 Like you sat there for 30 minutes and you prayed,

600
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,700
 right?

601
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 Way less hands.

602
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,900
 Isn't that interesting?

603
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,200
 Like lots of us were anxious in the past year, but

604
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,600
 very few of us prayed for longer than 30 minutes.

605
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,100
 And again, I'm not saying this to shame you, but

606
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,800
 to help you.

607
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,100
 I think there is a solution.

608
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,500
 Like nobody here is going to pray for 30 minutes

609
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 straight and be a worse person.

610
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,000
 Like it's only going to be helpful.

611
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,900
 And then he goes on in verse 8 and says, think about

612
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,800
 whatever is pure, whatever is right, whatever is

613
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,200
 true, whatever is noble, whatever is admirable or

614
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 lovely, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy,

615
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,100
 think about these things.

616
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,100
 He's saying again, he is prescribing in the New

617
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
 Testament, cognitive behavioral therapy.

618
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,700
 It's the same thing that I paid $250 an hour to be

619
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,200
 prescribed to me.

620
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,000
 And it's not a platitude or cliche and you may need

621
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,600
 medicine.

622
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,800
 Like like some of your own medicine, you may need

623
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,200
 medicine.

624
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
 That's awesome.

625
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
 That can be a really helpful tool to get you to a

626
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,700
 place where you can then pray with a clear mind.

627
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,500
 But all of us should practice long-extended

628
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
 contemplative prayer.

629
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,900
 That's good.

630
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,500
 So I'll share about what I'm going through right

631
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,100
 now, just because I think maybe it could encourage

632
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,400
 you.

633
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,000
 So I came back from a little short sabbatical this

634
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,100
 summer and I'd done that because I had hit burnout

635
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,600
 last year in a way that scared me.

636
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,900
 And so I took this break.

637
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,300
 I came back and I had so much anxiety that it was

638
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,100
 physical again.

639
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,900
 And I'd had that years ago, but I hadn't had it in

640
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,600
 a while and it hit me in a way that I was having

641
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 a such a physical reaction that I knew I needed

642
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,100
 help.

643
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,900
 And so I started going to group therapy, which I

644
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
 think is helpful.

645
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,200
 I know we're talking a lot about therapy, but you

646
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,400
 know what?

647
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,500
 We talk a lot about the Bible here and I think

648
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,000
 church is a good place to talk about what it looks

649
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
 like to apply the Bible.

650
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,800
 And so when we're talking about these conversations,

651
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,700
 I want to be really clear.

652
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,900
 Therapy is not an answer.

653
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,800
 It is not a fix-all.

654
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,900
 My husband always says it only works if it works.

655
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,900
 But what it does is it for me, it has helped me

656
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,300
 take what I believe into my life and into my living

657
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,200
 and into my soul where I am not as scared.

658
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,100
 Because what I learned in group therapy this year

659
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,400
 was that largely my 12-year-old self is scared

660
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,000
 of things.

661
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,500
 And I know this sounds crazy to some of you unless

662
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,700
 you've done therapy and you're like, "No, it's

663
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,600
 true. It's really happening." And I say that

664
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,700
 because I think it's important that we realize

665
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,500
 that we are a sum of our parts, that there's not

666
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,300
 some individual place in our lives where we can

667
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,700
 just decide in our thinking and read a verse and

668
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,800
 put it on our mind and all of a sudden we're healed

669
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,500
 and we should no longer be anxious.

670
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,900
 We live in such, under such shame and condemnation

671
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,700
 that we're anxious, that we can't ever actually

672
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
 get to the root of why we are anxious.

673
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,600
 There's a voice in our head that's telling us,

674
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,100
 "I'm scared.

675
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,400
 I'm scared.

676
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,300
 I'm scared." And then there's another voice that's

677
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
 judging the voice that's telling us we're scared.

678
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,700
 And that voice is the one that's actually wearing

679
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,200
 you out.

680
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,700
 The other voice of saying, "I'm scared," prior to

681
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
 12, I used to say that.

682
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,500
 I used to say, "I'm scared.

683
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,400
 Mom, help." But at 12, I learned that there were

684
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,900
 certain things expected of me and I had to, you

685
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
 know, measure up and I needed to meet the

686
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
 expectations in the room and they were never

687
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
 going to be spoken, but I would need to know

688
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,000
 what they were and then I would need to meet

689
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
 them. And some of them were impossible to meet,

690
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
 but I would still need to meet them.

691
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,600
 And so this voice started in me at 12 years old

692
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,000
 that was, "I'm scared and don't say it." In fact,

693
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,800
 don't be scared and meet all these expectations.

694
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,700
 And so what that does to someone over time is

695
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,500
 rather than just saying, "You know what?" And

696
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,200
 this is what I want to be sure we're really good

697
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
 at as believers, which a lot of us are.

698
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,100
 We need to be honest about what's going on.

699
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
 And the reason we need to be honest about what's

700
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,100
 going on is because confession is not just about

701
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,500
 sin. To confess means to be truthful, to tell

702
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,800
 the truth, to confess what is true. We have to

703
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
 say what is true or we're going to stay stuck

704
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,900
 for a long, long time. The freest people I know

705
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,300
 are the ones that admit that they're stuck and

706
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,200
 they need help. And you go to regen, oh my

707
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,100
 goodness, those stories, they get up there, they

708
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,800
 share what's going on in their life. And I want

709
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
 to be that way, but honestly, even just this

710
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,800
 year, I've had to practice being that way. So

711
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,300
 last night, we'll be real current, I'm in a

712
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
 small group with my friends and I'm learning

713
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,100
 like when you don't want to say something, say

714
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,400
 that thing. And so everybody's gone around in

715
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,900
 their small group and said the thing and it's

716
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
 my turn and I have something that is just

717
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,500
 boiling up inside of me. And I'm like, I need

718
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,000
 to go to bed. It's 1015. We need to be done. And

719
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,100
 then I knew like I'm supposed to say the thing

720
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,500
 I'm not supposed to say. And I cried pretty

721
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,200
 hard and I shared what I was stressed about and

722
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,300
 what I was feeling. And I got texts, my phone

723
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
 is probably blowing up right now, still from

724
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,900
 them because they began to fight for me and

725
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,500
 they began to say, hey, no, you're not going

726
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,400
 to go down like this. Let us tell you how we're

727
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,500
 going to support you and be around you and

728
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,000
 walk through this with you. There is power in

729
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
 saying it out loud. There are so many reasons

730
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,900
 to say it out loud because one, I got it off

731
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,000
 my chest like David talked about. Two, I had

732
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,600
 an army come around me and be praying for me

733
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,500
 and helping me in the last 24 hours. And three,

734
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,600
 I said what was true so that perhaps I could

735
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,300
 begin to deal with it. It's a beginning place.

736
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,200
 It's not the end place. But I'm very worried

737
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 about what I just heard of how many people

738
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,800
 aren't quick to say that they're struggling.

739
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,700
 And what I want to be clear about too is we

740
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
 don't say it so we can stay there. We say it

741
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,000
 so that we can get free. It's not something

742
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
 that we need to find our identity in and

743
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,800
 forever be defined as I'm someone who has

744
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,200
 anxiety. We are all people that have anxiety.

745
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,900
 We all are. And so what we also are are people

746
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,600
 that are filled with the spirit of God and

747
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,800
 more than conquerors and able to fight this

748
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,000
 together, never alone. I don't know anybody

749
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,300
 that's gotten very free alone.

750
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
 That's good.

751
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,900
 Yeah, I think on the note of the importance

752
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,300
 of having people in your life to challenge

753
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,800
 and courage come alongside. There was a story

754
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,600
 a friend of mine told me that was a fascinating

755
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
 engaging story. It was a time he went to

756
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,100
 Six Flags and they have this huge, I think

757
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,300
 they used to have it. I don't know if they

758
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
 have it anymore, where you could go up and

759
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,900
 see the city. It's like a huge elevator. You

760
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,300
 go up and you see the city. He said he went

761
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,800
 up with his group and it stopped at the top

762
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,900
 and it got stuck. And it was stuck for five

763
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,600
 hours. Oh, I'm very anxious listening. Yeah,

764
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,500
 and they're stuck in this glass box, hundreds

765
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,100
 of feet up in the air. And they tried to get

766
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,500
 it down. They tried to get it down. They've

767
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,200
 got workers kind of coming up all around

768
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,500
 them. And eventually, and there's kids. I

769
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,000
 mean, it's Six Flags. So it's like families,

770
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
 kids, people all in this little box. He said

771
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,800
 the kids were like doing totally fine. It was

772
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,700
 the adults who were freaking out. And he said

773
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,000
 eventually they opened the ceiling and this

774
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,200
 rope ladder was thrown down. No. And each one

775
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
 of them had to climb up and walk down the

776
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
 catwalk all the way down hundreds and hundreds

777
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,600
 of feet in the air. And he said afterwards

778
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
 there were phobias that developed with other

779
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,900
 people. And we were talking about just that

780
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,100
 topic of fear and kind of these more acute

781
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,700
 focused fears and how do you fight them. And

782
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,400
 I was just asking him because it was DTS

783
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,100
 professor head of counseling. And I was

784
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,200
 saying so in that moment, how would you

785
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,700
 encourage somebody like just hold on to, hey,

786
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,900
 I'll never leave you, don't forsake you.

787
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,500
 He said, no, that's all cerebral. You can

788
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,200
 tell them that verse, but until they have

789
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,600
 they have an associated negative emotional

790
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,300
 attachment to heights now. And they have to

791
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,000
 replace that associated emotional attachment

792
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,400
 from a negative one and replace it with a

793
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,500
 positive one. And one of the ways that they

794
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,200
 do that is by having relationships, friends

795
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
 that encourage them and help them take those

796
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
 steps. So in other words, phobias from

797
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,900
 elevators developed as a result of that. And

798
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,400
 they had that people come alongside of them

799
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
 and not just say, hey, get on the elevator.

800
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,500
 It's going to be fine. That works for some

801
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,900
 people. It doesn't work for everybody. But to

802
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
 have people that go, hey, we're going to take

803
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,200
 a step. Just going to step on the elevator.

804
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
 We take a step, we're going to step back off

805
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,300
 the elevator. We'll just let it go. Then we're

806
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,600
 going to take another step and I'm going to

807
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,700
 be right here with you. We're going to go and

808
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
 we're going to not just allow you to sit in

809
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,000
 that phobia. I'm going to help you and come

810
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,200
 alongside. Now, what's that have to do with,

811
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,700
 you know, most of us don't have fears of

812
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
 phobias of elevators, but we do have trust

813
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,400
 issues from past relationships. We do have

814
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,900
 issues where we don't, we have traumatic

815
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
 experiences with a family member or a father

816
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,800
 or maybe your parents fell apart and having

817
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
 other people in your life that encourage,

818
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,800
 that come alongside, that tell you it's true,

819
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,600
 but they also are going to encourage you to

820
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,200
 take that next step. Hey, not every guy is

821
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,500
 like that. Not every marriage ends that way.

822
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,100
 And I'm going to call you forward to be who

823
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,800
 God is calling you to be, to be who you

824
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,300
 ultimately want to be and to encourage you

825
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,800
 and spur you on and walk alongside and bear

826
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
 Galatians 6 says, one another's burdens

827
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,400
 together. So that's a long answer from all

828
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,500
 of us. That's good. It's good stuff. I think

829
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,400
 yeah, if we're going to clap, let's clap.

830
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,800
 Let's clap.

831
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
 Y'all, y'all all have talked a lot about

832
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,300
 the power of community and people. And if I

833
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,600
 had to bet there's someone here right now

834
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
 who's feeling super alone.

835
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,700
 They have tried or they've been hurt and

836
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,600
 or they just can't seem to like keep friendships

837
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
 or make friends. And I think that a lot of

838
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,200
 people, they could have a lot of friends and

839
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,900
 still feel alone. So people that struggle

840
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,300
 immensely with loneliness, what would you say

841
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,500
 to them with what you're saying the answer

842
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,600
 is community, community, community. But they're

843
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,700
 like, no, I'm, you don't know my circumstance.

844
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
 I'm super alone. I don't have community.

845
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
 And you just wrote a book on it.

846
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,900
 Yeah, I mean, I think you're not alone that

847
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,000
 you feel alone. I think the numbers are

848
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,700
 astounding with that as well. We've got prior

849
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,000
 to COVID three and five people said that they

850
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,500
 feel lonely. So we've got, you know, probably

851
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,400
 I would say four and a half after four and a

852
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
 half out of five that feel lonely post COVID.

853
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,400
 And so I think you're not alone and feeling

854
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,200
 alone and what's comforting about that is

855
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,000
 that probably other people need you and need

856
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,100
 the same things. And so I think, you know, one

857
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,500
 of the best things I've ever heard about being

858
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,200
 a good friend or being a connected human that

859
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
 can help someone else heal is to help people

860
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,400
 feel seen, safe and soothed. And I say those

861
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,700
 three words and I've talked about this. I think

862
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
 I talked about it maybe even at Awaken, but

863
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,800
 seen, safe and soothed. Those three words were

864
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,000
 so helpful to me because sometimes I'm the bad

865
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 friend, right? It's not just that my needs

866
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,700
 aren't getting met with a friend. It's that

867
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,000
 when someone shares me, I want to share something

868
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,100
 with me and they share, hey, I'm anxious. I want

869
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,600
 to fix it. I want to help them fix it. I want

870
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,100
 to solve the problem because I don't like

871
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,800
 negative emotions and I'm going to fix your

872
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
 problem so we can move forward. And has that

873
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,100
 ever felt really good to people? Like that's

874
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,900
 never felt good to me. I don't know why I do

875
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,000
 that to people, but I do. And what those words

876
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,800
 gave me was a plan. So when someone is sharing

877
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,200
 something difficult with you, which I think

878
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,700
 you all should do tonight, I really do. It's

879
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,700
 really going to be fun. You're going to find

880
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,600
 somebody and you're going to share your anxious

881
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,900
 thoughts and it's going to be fun because here's

882
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,100
 the thing, just like last night was for me, with

883
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,200
 tears, it actually, I felt seen, I felt safe, and

884
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,100
 I felt soothed with those friends and there was

885
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,500
 something healing about it. And I will say it

886
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,400
 is not easy to do. I was so uncomfortable. I

887
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
 mean, my hands were sweating when I shared. I

888
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,700
 started bawling. I rambled. I did all the

889
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,500
 things. It was awkward. But I think being awkward

890
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 to be whole and healthy is very worth it. And so

891
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 what I would say is practice this together. And

892
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,700
 if you're good at this, I absolutely promise

893
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,100
 you, you will have friends. If you make people

894
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,600
 feel seen, safe, and soothed, you will have more

895
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
 friends than you know what to do with because

896
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,700
 nobody makes other people feel that way. If you

897
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,100
 listen, you don't judge, and you don't fix, and

898
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,900
 you comfort them, and you nod, and you care, and

899
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,000
 you say, "I'm so sorry," and that must have been

900
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,800
 so hard. And then before you launch into a sermon,

901
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,100
 stop yourself. You will have more friends than

902
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,800
 you know what to do with.

903
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,700
 I know we're running long, so I'm going to try

904
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,800
 to say this really quick. And I have to say

905
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
 this because I'm big on community. If you don't

906
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,100
 have community, you need community. But I want

907
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,900
 to say something else on this topic of aloneness

908
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,300
 or loneliness is a huge benefit of Christianity

909
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,500
 is there's this repeated line in Scripture over

910
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,900
 and over. When God says something once, it's

911
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
 important. He says it twice, it's really important.

912
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,300
 If he says it like 17 times, you need to really

913
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,700
 listen. And he says, "Never will I leave you, and

914
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,500
 never will I forsake you." And there may be a day

915
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,400
 where you are all alone. Like there may, I mean

916
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,300
 truly, there might be a day where I don't know

917
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,400
 what's going to happen. I don't know what the

918
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,300
 future holds. But you're not, because the benefit

919
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,700
 of Christianity is that you're with God. And so

920
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,500
 maybe you're at this place where you really

921
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,800
 are thinking about ending it or doing something

922
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,200
 drastic. I want you to know that God sees

923
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,100
 you. He loves you. And he has a plan for you.

924
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
 And that's not platitudes. I mean it. He's crazy

925
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,800
 about you. Not some future version of you. Not

926
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
 when you get right. Not when you get your act

927
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,900
 together. Not, you know, when you stop doing

928
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,800
 that thing you can't stop doing. But like right

929
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,600
 now. And if you have trusted in Jesus Christ,

930
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,900
 his death and resurrection for the forgiveness

931
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
 of your sins, like literally you see the cross

932
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,300
 as a payment for all the wrong things that you've

933
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,100
 done. You're going to be with him forever and

934
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,200
 ever and ever and ever. And so instead of taking

935
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,500
 your life, lose your life. Say, "God, here it is.

936
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
 I want to end it all. But instead of ending it

937
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,900
 all, I'm just going to give it to you. What do

938
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,400
 you want to do with it? You want me to move

939
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,100
 overseas and serve the poor or care for lepers

940
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,200
 and get a disease that could kill me on me?

941
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,300
 I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want. You want

942
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,200
 me to go fight a war? I'll fight a war. You want

943
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,300
 me to stay here and wage war in corporate

944
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,200
 America and share the gospel with a stranger?

945
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
 Like I'll do anything. Here's my life. Instead

946
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
 of me taking my life, you take my life. I'm at

947
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,800
 the end of my rope. You take it." And this is

948
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,000
 it. And then I'm done. I won't say anything else.

949
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 I found myself really alone one day and it

950
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,800
 wasn't at the low. It was at a high. I had just

951
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,100
 written a book. I had just built a house. My

952
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
 house had this booth that I had designed that

953
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
 I was so excited about in the kitchen. I was

954
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,900
 sitting at that booth and I felt so alone. And

955
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,200
 I was just like, "God, do you even see me? Like

956
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
 I'm here. I'm doing your work. Do you even see

957
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,200
 me?" And I remembered Tommy Nelson talking

958
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,800
 about his depression and just feeling so

959
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,200
 alone. He was walking through his garden and

960
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,100
 he saw a dead sparrow. And he remembered in

961
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,100
 Matthew chapter 10 that God says, "A sparrow

962
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,500
 doesn't hit the ground apart from my will. And

963
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,700
 two sparrows are sold for a penny. Do I not

964
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,000
 love you so much more than them?" And I just

965
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 thought, "Okay, he loves me like a sparrow." And

966
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 my phone rang and I'm telling you the truth.

967
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,500
 My phone rang and it was a friend from college

968
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,000
 I hadn't talked to in, you know, over a year.

969
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,800
 And I said, "Hello?" And he's like, "What's up,

970
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 P?" And I was like, "What are you doing?" He said,

971
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,100
 "You're not going to believe it, man." And I

972
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,300
 was like, "No, what are you doing?" And he

973
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,200
 goes, "Man, I found these sparrows in my mailbox.

974
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,600
 I'm on my way to some bird sanctuary to make

975
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,900
 sure they live." I'm dead serious. I'm still

976
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,200
 shitting at that booth. And God in his kind

977
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,500
 way just said, "You're not alone. I see you. I'm

978
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,400
 going to be with you soon. Hang on. Would you

979
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,600
 hold on? Stay in there. Stay in the fight. I

980
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,400
 got work for you to do." And I'm so glad. I'm

981
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,700
 so glad that I get to be with you here tonight.

982
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,100
 I'm so glad that I get to be with these

983
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,600
 friends.

984
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,900
 Yeah, so good. Thank you for saying that.

985
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,700
 I want to wrap this up and then David, you

986
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:32,100
 can land the plane. I think, okay, I think we

987
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,500
 need to talk about social media just to kind

988
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,700
 of wrap it up because I think that a lot of

989
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,500
 us, just like we don't know what to do with

990
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,800
 anxiety, we don't know what to do with, we

991
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,900
 all know social media causes anxiety, causes

992
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,100
 comparison, causes all these issues. Social

993
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,200
 media, it's Satan's using this, Satan's using

994
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
 this. And actually, JP, I heard you say this

995
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
 at a luncheon not too long ago. You said,

996
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,700
 "We're all aware of it, but no one's doing

997
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,200
 anything about it." And I've thought about

998
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,600
 that multiple times since you said that. And

999
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,400
 I think, I know that I want to hear more

1000
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,100
 about the tension y'all are in because if

1001
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,900
 I had to guess, a lot of these people are

1002
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,500
 following you three on social media and

1003
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,000
 they're doing it because they want to learn

1004
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,600
 from you. They want to learn more about

1005
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,100
 these things. They want to, they want to

1006
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,900
 be fed spiritually. They want to look up

1007
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,600
 to leadership and all these different things.

1008
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
 There's good intent and social media can be

1009
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,700
 a powerful weapon. We know that. But all

1010
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,100
 three of you are on it. I'm on it. Most

1011
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,900
 people like, the same, if you said who's on

1012
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,100
 social media, but the same amount of people

1013
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,300
 would raise their hands that also say they

1014
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,200
 struggle with anxiety. And so you were kind

1015
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,300
 of waging that war, JP, of saying like, "We

1016
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,800
 all know it's this, but we're all still

1017
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,700
 posting and we're all still doing it and

1018
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,300
 no one's doing anything about it." How should

1019
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,800
 we think about social media and the power

1020
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,300
 that the enemy is using it for and then

1021
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,000
 how also though, like, God is using it and

1022
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 like, looking forward, how would you lead

1023
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 us and how we should interact with it?

1024
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 I mean, I mean, fast, fast from it regularly.

1025
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 And so I just saw, you know, today I take

1026
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,800
 off an hour a day, a day a week, a week a

1027
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,300
 month. Mike Kelsey says that a lot and I

1028
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,600
 think that's a really good practice. When

1029
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,300
 you do that 30 minutes of prayer, make

1030
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,700
 sure your phone's in the other room. When

1031
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,400
 you go to your profile to see how many

1032
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,600
 followers you have, just know that that's

1033
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,000
 harmful to you, most likely. I mean, maybe

1034
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,600
 you're stronger than me, but I'll just

1035
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,400
 speak firsthand, it's harmful to me to

1036
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,200
 begin to count followers. My brain is

1037
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,300
 constantly optimizing to know that if I

1038
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,600
 post like this, I get more likes and, you

1039
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,400
 know, that kind of thing. And so I have

1040
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,600
 to really watch that because I don't want

1041
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,500
 to find identity in those things. If it's

1042
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,600
 a fast from it for for seasons and maybe

1043
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,200
 do away with it altogether, like nobody's

1044
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,800
 going to get to heaven and be mad that

1045
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,000
 they had to live life without Instagram

1046
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 or or TikTok, right? I mean, you see the

1047
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,800
 latest dance or whatever it is, like

1048
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,000
 you're going to be okay without the

1049
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 trends. And and so I mean, there's there's

1050
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,500
 nothing new under the sun. It's it's I

1051
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,600
 don't have any better advice or counsel

1052
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,300
 than that. I can't improve on that. It's

1053
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,400
 just is fast from it and do away with it

1054
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,500
 altogether if you need to. Hebrews 12

1055
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,400
 says run the race that is set before you,

1056
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
 throwing off the burden and the sin. I

1057
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,600
 think the more that you have a race and

1058
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,200
 you know what your vision is, then your

1059
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,800
 days are busy and your days are full. And

1060
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,400
 the less we think about ourselves and

1061
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,000
 the less we think about what's wrong in

1062
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,800
 the world and the more we're about the

1063
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,600
 work right in front of us. You know, I

1064
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,800
 mean, Scripture says that live a quiet

1065
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,400
 life, work with your hands. I think that's

1066
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
 so interesting. And I think we need to be

1067
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
 okay and content doing hard work and

1068
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,500
 doing good work. Many of you have jobs

1069
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,400
 where you can browse the Internet during

1070
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,600
 the day in your job. Don't. Don't. Do the

1071
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,700
 work that's in front of you. Love the

1072
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,100
 people that are in front of you. Take

1073
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,800
 care of your little sphere, your little

1074
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,700
 circle, and you just have less time for

1075
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,900
 it. You just don't have as much time to

1076
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,500
 be on it. Live the life that God

1077
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,300
 intends you to live. I mean, what she's

1078
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,100
 saying, we focus on the church so much

1079
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,700
 on the don'ts. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

1080
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,000
 Don't. No, just get busy doing the things

1081
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,100
 that God has for you to do. For you are

1082
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,800
 God's workmanship, created in Christ

1083
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
 Jesus to do good works, which He has

1084
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,600
 prepared in advance for you to do. And

1085
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
 it literally says walk in the works, like

1086
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,300
 poetry. Walk in the poem that, the poem

1087
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,800
 that God has written before you were

1088
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,900
 ever born. He's written for you to walk

1089
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,300
 in. And as you do that, you know, who has

1090
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,400
 time for a TikTok? Some of you need to

1091
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,300
 walk out of here and you need a life

1092
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,700
 plan. Some of you, the reason you're so

1093
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,500
 anxious is you do not even know what

1094
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,900
 you're doing. Your relationships are out

1095
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,700
 of order. You do not eat well. You do not

1096
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,400
 work out. You do not have any schedule to

1097
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
 your life. You have chaos everywhere. You

1098
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,100
 need to go out and really practically

1099
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
 lay out, like, hey, I'm gonna wake up at

1100
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,600
 this time. I'm gonna spend time with God.

1101
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,300
 I'm gonna work out. I'm gonna eat a

1102
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,900
 little bit better. I'm not gonna drink so

1103
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,100
 much at night or at all. Like, you need

1104
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
 to make choices and then hold each other

1105
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,800
 accountable because those small things

1106
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,900
 are like medicine. They really are. And

1107
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,200
 God knew it. And so this orderly life

1108
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,600
 that he calls us to is actually a way of

1109
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,000
 prospering. And so it's fun. I think it's

1110
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,600
 fun to life plan. And I like what

1111
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,000
 you're saying. -And canoe. -Canoe is my plan.

1112
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,400
 -I mean, here's the thing is I agree with

1113
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,700
 what you're saying and it got me excited

1114
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,400
 because I think we so often go, don't

1115
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,600
 feel that. Don't think that. Don't fear.

1116
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,700
 And it's just not helpful. And I think

1117
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,100
 what we need to do is get busy with this

1118
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,600
 book and what he's called us to do in

1119
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,000
 loving our people. And as we do, notice

1120
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,100
 the burden and the sin in our life and

1121
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,400
 throw it off. But don't let it consume us

1122
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,300
 and distract us from what we're supposed

1123
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,000
 to be doing. -On noted, related to all of

1124
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,500
 those things, social media is not a bad

1125
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,600
 thing or a good thing. It's a thing.

1126
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,800
 Like, the Apostle Paul, I think, would

1127
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,000
 have loved social media. I mean, with a

1128
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,200
 click of a button, you can share the

1129
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,200
 gospel with millions of people. I mean,

1130
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,700
 how dope would that have been? -I'm sharing

1131
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,600
 the gospel with 10,000 people. -And yet,

1132
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,700
 I think what both of them pointed to is

1133
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,500
 doing an audit of asking, hey, what is

1134
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,900
 happening? And auditing my feelings, my

1135
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
 emotions, my thoughts, my take. What does

1136
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,100
 it mean to take every thought captive?

1137
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,400
 It means that just like when you go to

1138
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,500
 the airport and you have a bag and you're

1139
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,100
 going through security and the guy looks

1140
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,900
 at it and he's like, man, you got a

1141
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,400
 pocketknife in here, bro. We got to take

1142
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,900
 this away. You're going to jail. He's

1143
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,100
 going through and making sure the wrong

1144
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,500
 things are not in that. And I think as it

1145
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,300
 relates to our thoughts, anytime I'm

1146
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,000
 feeling like auditing, man, I get on there

1147
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,800
 and I feel depressed. I get on there when

1148
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,500
 I'm distracted because I don't have a

1149
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,200
 plan and so I just kind of gravitationally

1150
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,900
 drift to that and auditing the feelings

1151
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,600
 and thoughts that I'm having and how is

1152
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,200
 it contributing. Auditing, when I find

1153
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,300
 myself going, hey man, how many people

1154
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,100
 are following me? Auditing, when I

1155
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,400
 find myself going, oh man, I'm so

1156
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,000
 discouraged because I see how amazing

1157
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
 their life is and how disappointing I am,

1158
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
 how disappointed I am that she just got

1159
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,400
 engaged and I'm always the bride's man,

1160
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,100
 never the bride and auditing those

1161
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,700
 thoughts. And I think that's a lost art.

1162
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,000
 I don't think that people do. And I

1163
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,700
 certainly, candidly, I'm not always great

1164
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,900
 at that and I have to do that to the

1165
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,700
 Lord and say, here's what I'm feeling,

1166
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,200
 God. Here's what I'm thinking. Here's

1167
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,700
 what is going on in my heart and going

1168
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,400
 to God honestly and sharing things that

1169
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,300
 I'm feeling.

1170
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,700
 - That's good. A theme I've just heard

1171
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,800
 throughout tonight is let people in and

1172
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,400
 be honest. You just have to be honest

1173
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,600
 with yourself and quit playing the game

1174
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,400
 and got to be honest. Got to start being

1175
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
 honest. So, could you help me thank our

1176
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,800
 friends, JP, Jenny, David.

1177
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,600
 (audience applause)

1178
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
 I actually want, JP, would you mind

1179
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,600
 praying for us and then David, you

1180
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
 could talk to us a little bit.

1181
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,900
 - I'd love to. Father, we just need

1182
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,600
 your help. The enemy's lying to us and

1183
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,700
 he's telling us that we can't tell

1184
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,300
 anybody that we're struggling. And so

1185
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,400
 would you stir in us by the power of

1186
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,600
 your Holy Spirit of courage to be known,

1187
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,900
 to be vulnerable. Even tonight, like

1188
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,600
 just there's someone I know that is just

1189
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,400
 like, I can't do that. And I pray that

1190
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,800
 they would turn to the person to the

1191
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,100
 right or the left and find a safe place

1192
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,900
 and that that person would have the

1193
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,400
 courage to put their arm around them

1194
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,600
 and stay with them until they're helped,

1195
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,900
 until they get the aid that they need.

1196
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,500
 And so Lord, if there's anybody in this

1197
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,200
 place watching online, listening later,

1198
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,300
 right now driving in their car, wherever

1199
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,800
 they're at, Father, would you remind

1200
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,100
 them that you love them in the same

1201
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,300
 ways that you have me so many times?

1202
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,800
 Would you remind them that you love

1203
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
 them? That you have a plan and a purpose

1204
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,100
 for their life that is worthwhile?

1205
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,200
 Would you even give them a vision for it?

1206
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,900
 And would you surround them with people

1207
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,000
 who know them and love you and love them

1208
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,500
 and know you and would offer them

1209
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,700
 godly accountability? Father, I thank you

1210
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,800
 so much for Jesus. I thank you that you

1211
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,300
 purchased a glorious inheritance for us

1212
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,600
 in eternity and that you're keeping it

1213
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,200
 safe and that you sealed us by your

1214
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,400
 Holy Spirit and that in this world as

1215
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,600
 we have trouble, you are preserving us.

1216
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
 And so as our bodies are wasting away

1217
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,100
 like jars of clay, as they're being

1218
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,400
 broken, Lord, I pray that you would

1219
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,000
 preserve us, that you would strengthen

1220
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,400
 us and in the midst of temptation, that

1221
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,800
 you would strengthen us and that you

1222
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,200
 would lead us according to your will.

1223
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,000
 In the name of your Son, Jesus Christ,

1224
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,500
 amen. Amen.

1225
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,800
 - This, I shared earlier that I would

1226
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,200
 share from Mark chapter 4 and I'll say

1227
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,700
 this, this series on anxiety and mental

1228
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,100
 health and punctuate everything that we've

1229
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,800
 just gone through the last four weeks.

1230
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,900
 My son, when he was three and four and

1231
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,000
 even sometimes today at five, he'll come

1232
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,500
 into our room late at night, three in

1233
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,400
 the morning and he'll walk in and he'll

1234
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,800
 come over to my bed and he'll wake me

1235
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,600
 up and he'll say, "Dad, Dad, there's

1236
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,400
 monsters underneath my bed."

1237
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,100
 And I always find myself going, you know,

1238
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,100
 waking up and seeing, it looks like

1239
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
 children of the corn, this silhouette of

1240
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,200
 somebody walking at me just, "Dad, ah!"

1241
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,400
 And if I'm honest, there's part of me

1242
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,300
 that kind of loves that he does that.

1243
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,700
 And here's why, it's not because I like

1244
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,900
 being woken up at three in the morning.

1245
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,400
 It's because when he does that, it

1246
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,500
 communicates something.

1247
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,400
 It communicates that he believes that if

1248
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,700
 I have a problem, I can go to my dad.

1249
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,200
 And that he can do something about it.

1250
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,900
 Whatever monsters are there, I can go,

1251
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,100
 and my dad is strong enough to handle it.

1252
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,400
 Mark chapter four, Jesus is on this boat

1253
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,300
 and the disciples are out in the middle

1254
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,800
 of this lake, it's late at night, and

1255
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,100
 they're rowing across.

1256
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,300
 It says that Jesus was asleep in the

1257
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,000
 middle of the boat on a cushion.

1258
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,600
 And a great storm hit all around him.

1259
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,000
 And the disciples began to panic.

1260
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,100
 And these were fishermen for a living.

1261
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
 They'd seen storms.

1262
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,600
 They were used to storms.

1263
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,900
 But the word used, it was like an

1264
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,300
 earthquake on the water.

1265
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,100
 It'd be the equivalent of pilots.

1266
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,500
 Man, they fly through turbulence and

1267
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,700
 they're okay, but when the pilots

1268
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,200
 begin to freak out about the turbulence,

1269
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
 that's essentially what happens.

1270
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,000
 And they go to Jesus and they wake him up.

1271
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,200
 And Jesus asks a really interesting question.

1272
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,000
 The disciples say, "Lord, don't you care

1273
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,200
 that we're perishing?

1274
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,900
 We're going to die."

1275
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,700
 And Jesus gets up from that cushion and

1276
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:17,300
 he walks and he says, "Be still!"

1277
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,600
 And the water turns to glass.

1278
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:28,500
 And then he asks what I think is so profound.

1279
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,700
 He says, "Why are you so afraid?"

1280
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,600
 And why is that profound?

1281
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,300
 Think about what he said.

1282
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,100
 I mean, the disciples are going,

1283
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,400
 "What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'

1284
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,300
 We were about to die.

1285
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,200
 The boat was going to turn over.

1286
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,600
 What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'"

1287
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,800
 This is the plane is going down in midair

1288
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,700
 and we're all freaking out.

1289
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,000
 And you're like, "Hey, guys, what's going on?

1290
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,600
 Why are you so afraid?

1291
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,300
 What do you mean, 'Why are we afraid?'

1292
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,100
 Do you not have any faith?

1293
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,800
 Don't you know who's with you?"

1294
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,100
 Now, God, he wants us to walk through this life

1295
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,400
 with the type of relationship that whatever I face,

1296
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,800
 my God is strong enough to calm the storms,

1297
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,300
 like a father is strong enough to face the monsters

1298
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,600
 under the bed.

1299
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,500
 He is with me and he's invited me to bring

1300
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,300
 all of those things to me

1301
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,000
 because he's strong enough to deal with them

1302
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,500
 and he cares for me and he cares for you.

1303
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,000
 And I hope you leave with an understanding

1304
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,400
 that is who your God is.

1305
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,400
 The wind and the waves obey him.

1306
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,700
 He is nearer.

1307
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,400
 He's nearer to you than the breath that you breathe.

1308
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,200
 And your God is strong and he is for you.

1309
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,100
 If you've never trusted in Jesus,

1310
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,200
 you're not gonna experience the peace

1311
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,100
 we talked about in this series

1312
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,600
 because you don't know the Prince of Peace.

1313
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,700
 You don't know the one who gave his life

1314
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,400
 so that you would spend eternity with God for forever,

1315
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,000
 not by how good you are,

1316
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,400
 but by receiving him as the payment for your sin.

1317
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,300
 Tonight is your night.

1318
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,400
 And God, in a moment of faith, just saying,

1319
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,100
 "God, I believe that.

1320
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,900
 I receive that.

1321
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,100
 I accept that."

1322
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,000
 Your eternity will never be the same.

1323
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,500
 Your ability to experience peace in this life

1324
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,000
 will actually be possible.

1325
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,900
 And tonight, the God who is there,

1326
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,000
 who 2,000 years ago gave his life for you,

1327
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,200
 is inviting you into that.

1328
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
 For those of us who do know him,

1329
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,600
 we're gonna worship one last time in song.

1330
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,700
 And Father, we thank you

1331
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,300
 that you have made a way through the cross

1332
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,100
 by what you did in our place

1333
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,900
 for us to have peace in this life and eternity forever.

1334
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,700
 Thank you for Jenny and JP and J.D.

1335
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,400
 and just a chance to talk about ways

1336
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,000
 that you invite us to peace.

1337
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,100
 Would you allow us to live in that freedom?

1338
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,300
 We worship you now in song.

1339
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,800
 Amen.

1340
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:52,800
