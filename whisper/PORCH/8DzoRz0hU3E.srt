00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,520
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,240
 All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room, all of our PortsLive locations,

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,080
 specifically PortsLive Tulsa, Midland, Texas, Austin, Texas, Fort Worth, Texas,

4
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,000
 Cincinnati, all the different live locations.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,720
 And of course, everybody here, we're kicking off a brand new series tonight

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,440
 called FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, where you asked, we have listened to

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,840
 hundreds and thousands of emails, DMs, just people with frequently asked

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,040
 questions, and we want to provide weekly answers that come from God's Word on how

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,400
 to think about and what God has to say about certain cultural topics, certain

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,160
 topics and just mysteries of life.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,760
 And tonight we are kicking that off.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,480
 Let me show you guys something you probably haven't seen since you were like seven.

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,680
 I've seen one of these before.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
 Yeah, they're still around.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
 This is my kids, specifically my six-year-old son and four-year-old

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,680
 daughter's new favorite toy, to the point where this morning, true story,

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,760
 they ran in our room early and they bust open the door and they say,

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,040
 "Can we find that magic ball?

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
 We can't find...where's the magic ball?

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
 We can't find it."

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,520
 And they have just obsessed of this thing where they just kind of realized it's their

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,240
 first introduction recently to it, and they'll go up to it, and they don't even

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,040
 fully understand how it exactly works or the questions they ask don't even make

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,560
 sense that you're supposed to ask like, "Hey, will I end up getting this promotion?"

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
 Shake, see it.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
 My daughter is just like, "Girls better than boys."

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,640
 And then she can't read, so she's like, "What does it say?"

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
 Oh, it's so great.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,840
 And then my son asks questions too that are like ridiculous.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,440
 He's like, "Is a polar bear the best type of bear?"

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,600
 And then he shakes it and it's like, "He can read.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
 Really hazy.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
 Try again."

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,840
 And they just love this.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,800
 And really, it's the first time they're being introduced to asking, "Hey,

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,640
 is it going to be a good day tomorrow?"

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,320
 And they shake it up, and they'll talk really close to it because they think that

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,280
 does something.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
 And then my son will read the answers.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,880
 But really, it's a reflection of a curiosity about the future that doesn't just happen

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
 when you're little.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,160
 That inside of this room, there's still questions as it relates to,

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
 "What does the future hold for me?

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,840
 What does God have for me?

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
 Am I living God's plan for me?

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
 Is this the person I'm supposed to date?

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,800
 Is this the person I'm supposed to marry?

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,760
 What is the future career that I have in front of me or my future at this specific

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
 job that I have?"

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,760
 Like, even if I was right now to say, "Hey, who's dating in this section

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,160
 right here?

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
 Anybody dating?

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
 Okay, two of you guys, all right?

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,120
 We're going to have to really, really...

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,520
 You know what?

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
 Cancel FAQ.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
 We're doing a dating series, okay?

58
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,760
 If I was to say, "What's your name?"

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,280
 - Natalie.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,720
 - Natalie.

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,040
 And?

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,120
 - Kyle.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,320
 - All right.

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,760
 It's Kyle's...

65
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,200
 Give it up for Natalie and Kyle.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:35,560
 If I was to say, "Man, is it the plan for Natalie and Kyle to get married?"

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
 You may rely on it.

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
 Wow, that just put a lot of pressure on that.

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,520
 Who in this section would like a raise?

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,720
 Okay.

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,000
 Are you going to get a raise tomorrow?

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
 Ask again later.

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,880
 Awesome.

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,120
 It is certain.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
 Congratulations, you're going to get a raise.

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
 Now, here's what's funny is we know that's ridiculous and it's a joke and,

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
 you know, don't count on the raise.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,600
 And Kyle and Natalie, you know, hopefully know that that's entirely a joke and all

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,200
 the pressure that just got out of that relationship shouldn't be present.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,440
 But what's funny is, you know, if I was to do that and spot out certain

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,680
 relationships, and I'm joking around and saying, "Don't we all kind of wish to know

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,160
 and want to know if it's true if in two years, you know, this relationship gets

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,400
 married, they're going to come back here and be like, 'It was that moment right

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,440
 there with the magic eight ball and God predicted that this was going to happen.'"

85
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
 Because we have this desire to discern what God's will for our life is, to know,

86
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,400
 and we look for signs and we're constantly curious about what is God's will for my

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,760
 life?

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,400
 Is this God's plan unfolding in my life?

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,920
 What does God have for me today and in this season, in this future?

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,080
 To the point where often we don't just look at magic eight balls, we're constantly

91
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,960
 looking for like signs and confirmations and things where we're driving down the

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,240
 road going, "If I hit three green lights in a row, I am going to ask Becky on that

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,400
 date.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
 Green, green.

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
 Okay, it's turning yellow.

96
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
 I'm going to speed up through the light.

97
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
 Now I can ask her out on that date."

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,320
 Or, "I'll go and, you know, I got a crush on...you got a crush on Kyle and Kyle's

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,400
 around and tonight at Torchy's afterwards, you go and the guy behind the desk or the

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,560
 guy behind the counter, he's checking you out and lo and behold, what is his name?

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
 Kyle."

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 It's a sign from God.

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,960
 I was destined to be with him.

104
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,120
 And all of that's really silly and I'm not saying God can't speak in unusual ways,

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,080
 but it's a reflection of this desire we have to know God's will.

106
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,520
 And I don't want to miss God's will.

107
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,880
 It's just God's plan for my life.

108
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,480
 And so tonight, I want to talk about that subject of God's will and how you can know

109
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,720
 you are living within God's will or that you're living outside of it.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,480
 And I also want to address, can I mess up God's will for my life?

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,600
 Because a lot of us maybe came into the room and we just carry an angst or a fear over,

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,880
 "Man, did I make the wrong decision?

113
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,480
 Did I take the wrong job and I moved to that city and I really was never supposed to be

114
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
 here and I was supposed to be in another city?

115
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,840
 And had I been there, just the story would have been different.

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,760
 Had I never dated him or her, maybe I would have found someone else and my life would

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,280
 look way different than it is right now.

118
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,120
 Have I messed up God's will for my life?"

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,360
 And I want to walk through and it's going to be a little bit academic, but we're going

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,680
 to talk about God's will because God, more than you even want to know, His will for your

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,080
 life, wants you to know His will for you.

122
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,560
 And He has made it clear how you can pursue and understand His will, both in the day-to-day

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,920
 and in the big picture for your life.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,520
 And so we're going to unpack specifically what God's will is and what the Bible means

125
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,920
 when it says that, and then I want to look at two things and how you can have better

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,800
 clarity on are you living in God's will for your life.

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,600
 And at first, in order to do that, I really have to unpack what the Bible says when the

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
 Bible talks about God's will.

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,520
 And if you've read it, you've come around different verses over and over where it says

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
 the will of God.

131
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
 This is God's will for you.

132
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,800
 This is the will of God that those who live according to the will of God.

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:28,920
 And there's two primary ways that that phrase, the will of God, is used in the Bible.

134
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,240
 And the first is it talks about His known will.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,280
 So if you take notes, I'm going to try to make this as non-academic and as clear as

136
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
 possible, but there's two categories.

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,080
 There's God's known will, and I'm going to explain what that is, and then His unknown

138
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 will.

139
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,320
 Now, you may have thought of it like that or never quite thought of it, but you kind

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,480
 of grasp those.

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,560
 By known will, here's what I mean.

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
 I mean His providential will.

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,320
 So when it says in different books in the Old Testament, God will bring about His divine

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 plan.

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,760
 There's God's providential will and His moral will.

146
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,360
 That's the instructions for life and things that God would say, "If you do this, it's

147
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
 going to go well for you."

148
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,880
 That makes up the known will.

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,280
 So God's providential will, that is, "Hey, I'm going to send my son Jesus into the earth.

150
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,240
 He's going to die on a cross, come back alive."

151
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,060
 Nothing man does can stop that.

152
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,900
 That's a part of the known will.

153
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,100
 And then there's His moral will for you.

154
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,660
 This is the instructions on life.

155
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,440
 What are some examples of God's known will?

156
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,080
 Or some examples of the moral aspect of His known will?

157
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,680
 First Thessalonians, it says, "You and I are to rejoice or give thanks always, for this

158
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,880
 is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus."

159
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,180
 First Thessalonians 5, 18.

160
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,080
 There's a lot of different examples.

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,980
 First Thessalonians 4 says, "This is the will of God, your sanctification."

162
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,340
 His will includes instructions that include you being sanctified, which is a word that

163
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,220
 means to be made to look more like Jesus.

164
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,980
 His will would include that you do what's right, even if it costs you.

165
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,820
 This all makes up His known will.

166
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
 Why do I say that?

167
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,780
 That comes from 1 Peter 3, 17.

168
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,220
 It is better if it is God's will to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

169
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,980
 So you have His known will, which includes kind of the big picture, God's sovereign,

170
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,060
 He's going to do it.

171
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:28,020
 And then His specific instructions and principles on how to live life.

172
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,980
 And then there's the unknown will.

173
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:38,140
 And this would include His sovereign plan and what future He has ahead for you.

174
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,740
 And I want to talk for the next little bit about how those are related to one another

175
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,680
 and how they play off of each other.

176
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,820
 And how in order to know His unknown will for you, the future that He has, how you can

177
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:58,300
 know that you are walking in step with His unknown will, how it requires an understanding

178
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,860
 and an application of His known will.

179
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:10,580
 So the first section or thing that I want to camp out on is how living in God's will

180
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:18,700
 means point number one, applying God's known will to your life.

181
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,540
 If you want to know, am I living outside or inside of God's will for my life, it means

182
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,060
 I'm going to apply His known will, specifically those moral instructions to my life.

183
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,580
 I know that when I'm obedient to those, I am living inside of God's will for my life.

184
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,340
 And in fact, if you got to leave early, you get nothing else as it relates to this sermon.

185
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,700
 Here's what I want you to hear.

186
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:52,660
 Your ability to discern God's unknown will for your life is directly related to the degree

187
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,900
 of obedience you have in His known will for your life.

188
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,320
 Let me say it again.

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,340
 Your ability to know, hey, when something happens and you get this job and is that the

190
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,060
 Lord calling me to this new city or are we supposed to get married, maybe we're supposed

191
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,020
 to, your ability to know, hey, this is God's leading and this is God's plan and this is

192
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:20,380
 God's doing and this is God's will in those moments is directly related to your obedience

193
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,140
 to His known will.

194
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,900
 The things He's already said, hey, these are the things that I want to be a part of your

195
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,540
 life.

196
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,700
 And if you're not living inside of that, then your ability to determine and decipher, is

197
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,860
 this God's will, is going to be diminished or impossible.

198
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
 Why do I say that?

199
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,780
 Romans chapter 12, verse 2 says this.

200
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,740
 Don't conform to the pattern of this world.

201
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,340
 In other words, don't let your life look like everybody else in the world.

202
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,660
 Don't date like the world.

203
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,940
 Don't spin like the world.

204
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,180
 Don't dress like the world.

205
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,620
 Don't speak like the world.

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,300
 Don't when you look around at the world be like, huh, everybody looks just, acts just

207
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,860
 like me.

208
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:10,700
 Rather, be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you begin to think differently.

209
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,300
 You begin to think like God's word says and it leads to different thinking and different

210
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
 living.

211
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,980
 Transformed living comes from transformed thinking.

212
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,660
 Paul says, don't live like everybody else.

213
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,540
 Have your mind transformed by God's word.

214
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,020
 And then he brings up God's will.

215
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:35,700
 You will be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect

216
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 will.

217
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,860
 He says, you know how you can know the unknown will of God in your life?

218
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,220
 And it's God at work and what God is up to is by having your mind and your living and

219
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,340
 your thinking transformed by his known will.

220
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,820
 You begin to apply, there's certain things that, let me just be honest.

221
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,620
 The answer, can I not be in God's will?

222
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
 Of course.

223
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,300
 In fact, it'd be unloving for me to say that everyone in this room was in God's will right

224
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,180
 now living in accordance with God's will for their life.

225
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
 It's not true.

226
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,300
 Because there's certain things the Bible said that you're not doing.

227
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,660
 And I'm speaking particularly to Christians that God has specific desires and a will for

228
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,980
 your life.

229
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,380
 And there's categories that it's abundantly clear.

230
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,180
 They relate to your work, relationships, dating.

231
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,540
 Like what are some of the things that God's will, his known will, and if you're going

232
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,820
 to apply and live according to his will, it will include?

233
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,260
 Well, for everyone, part of God's will is that you would know Jesus.

234
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,980
 You would have a relationship with God through Jesus Christ.

235
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,260
 Second Peter chapter three says God wants no one to perish but everyone to come to faith

236
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,420
 and salvation in Jesus.

237
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,500
 Part of God's will, whether you're a believer or Christian or not, and the reason you're

238
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,020
 in this room right now, and candidly the reason you have breath in your lungs still is because

239
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,540
 God is pursuing a relationship with you.

240
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,180
 He gave his life on the cross and died in your place and in my place, paid for every

241
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,700
 sin past, present, and future you will ever commit because he wanted to have a relationship

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
 with you and then he came back alive.

243
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,960
 And anyone who accepts Jesus as the payment for every sin and everything wrong they've

244
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,660
 ever done in their life, the Bible says he's going to live eternally with God just like

245
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,620
 Jesus came back alive.

246
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,340
 So part of his will includes you knowing Jesus.

247
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
 But let's drill in a little further.

248
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,580
 What is God's will for your work?

249
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,900
 If you're a banker, you're a barista, you were an accountant, you're a teacher, you

250
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,260
 don't have a job right now, what is God's will for your work?

251
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:44,260
 Well Colossians chapter three says whatever you do, work at it with all of your heart

252
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,660
 as working for the Lord and not for human leaders and masters that you would, whatever

253
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,500
 you did today, as much as you don't like your job, you wish you would have another career

254
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,540
 and you're exploring different LinkedIn opportunities and you may go back to school for another

255
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,780
 career, God says, "Hey, whatever you did today," you want to know how you can know you're in

256
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,660
 the will of God as it relates to your job, your career?

257
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:12,460
 You worked hard today as you were not working for a paycheck or a person, you were working

258
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
 for the Lord.

259
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
 That's what God said.

260
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,940
 In other words, today during your office hours or you're hanging at the office, you weren't

261
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,900
 scrolling through Amazon going through the Prime Day to see what kind of deals and taking

262
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:27,820
 advantage of your employer, you work hard and you can know if you are working hard as

263
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,660
 though you're working for the Lord as it relates to your work, you're in the will of God.

264
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,940
 And you can know that if you're taking advantage and that you are ripping off the person who's

265
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:46,020
 employing you, you're lazy, you're outside of God's will for your job.

266
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:53,460
 And God candidly is a lot more concerned about how you work, where you work, than He is about

267
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,380
 where you work.

268
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,620
 And if you want to be inside of God's will for your work, it relates to, "I'm going to

269
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,220
 work hard as though I'm working for the Lord.

270
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,820
 What are some other commands that I can know I'm living or I can know I'm living outside

271
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,900
 of God's will?

272
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,700
 Let's talk about love life, romantic life, God's will and relationships, because there's

273
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,580
 some really clear ones that are in there.

274
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,100
 The Bible says that God's will, if you're a Christian, is that you would marry somebody

275
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,740
 who loves Jesus.

276
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,820
 They don't just check a box on Facebook that says I'm a Christian.

277
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
 They love Jesus.

278
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,780
 They're a follower of Christ.

279
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,380
 They're passionate about them.

280
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,700
 And if you're dating somebody who is not that, listen to me very closely.

281
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,500
 As somebody who has no other than a vested interest in seeing you experience all that

282
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,620
 God has for you, no other motivation, if you're dating someone who's not a believer, you are

283
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,100
 living outside of God's will for your life.

284
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,260
 You are living in disobedience to God's will for your life.

285
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,060
 Second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14 says, "Do not partner together or marry together

286
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,900
 or date together with unbelievers, for what a righteousness and wickedness have in common."

287
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:10,020
 There's another aspect of God's will for your love life, that you would pursue sexual purity.

288
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,140
 The Bible says sex is intended for the context of marriage.

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:21,500
 So if you're dating and you're having sex, you are living outside of God's will for your

290
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,800
 love life.

291
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:33,480
 In 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 3 it says this, "It is God's will that you would be

292
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,120
 sanctified or made to look more like Jesus, that you would avoid sexual..."

293
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
 What is God's will?

294
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,240
 "That you would be made to look more like Jesus and that you would avoid sexual immorality,"

295
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,880
 which is sex in any context outside of marriage, "and that you should learn to control your

296
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 own body."

297
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,480
 So there's a lot of messages on why God's heart is that, and it's certainly not to rip

298
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,300
 you off, it's certainly not because he's a killjoy.

299
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,360
 God created sex.

300
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,480
 He's the inventor of it.

301
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,520
 So he's not against it.

302
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,920
 He created it for a specific context.

303
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,720
 And if you're sleeping together, you are directly outside of God's will for that dating relationship.

304
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,920
 Now here's where this is real.

305
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,800
 I have been doing this for the last 12 years, having a lot of conversations with couples

306
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,840
 and they get engaged or they want to get engaged and they'll come down front and sometimes

307
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,720
 we have a relationship and they'll ask, we do our two-on-two counseling or, "Will you

308
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,920
 and your wife meet with us?"

309
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,120
 And as we look towards getting engaged, or maybe they are engaged at some point, and

310
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,440
 going through the counseling, I'll ask, "Are you guys sleeping together?

311
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,640
 Or are you pursuing purity?"

312
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,520
 And sometimes the answer is, "No, it's not easy, but we are fighting for purity and cannot

313
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,760
 wait for that day."

314
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,120
 And then other times it's, "Yeah, we are, but we mess up once.

315
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,560
 It's just really hard not to.

316
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,840
 And we're pretty much like we're committed and we're going to get married.

317
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,400
 We may elope anyways."

318
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,440
 There's always the, "We may elope anyways."

319
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,080
 And I'll say, "Huh.

320
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:18,320
 So you think it's God's will for you two to get married.

321
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,880
 And yet, although we don't know if that's true, what God has clearly said is His will

322
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,960
 for you two.

323
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,800
 You are rejecting.

324
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:44,840
 Why would you be confident that you hear and know His will over here when you're not listening

325
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,640
 to it over here?

326
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:58,040
 And the more obedient and surrendered you are to the revealed known will of God, the

327
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,720
 better you will be able to detect God's unknown will for your life.

328
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,640
 And He has some very clear instructions as it relates to relationships.

329
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,160
 And He's not done with you.

330
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,840
 God's not done with the story He's writing with you.

331
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,240
 But if that's your dating relationship right now, as somebody who cares and wants you to

332
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,040
 experience what God has for you in marriage, you may need a breakup.

333
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,080
 My saying that's God's will, I don't know.

334
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,720
 I know you need to stop having sex if you're a follower of Jesus.

335
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,640
 That's for sure His will.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,360
 So what else?

337
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
 Other things that are a part of God's will for your life that you would be committed

338
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 to a local church.

339
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,080
 Hebrews chapter 13 verse 17 says, "Obey or remember your leaders and listen to them as

340
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,600
 those who keep watch over your soul."

341
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,560
 Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 says, "Don't neglect gathering together as some are in the habit

342
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,960
 of doing, but continue day after day."

343
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,080
 But the Bible over and over hints that you are to be connected to a local church.

344
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,600
 And so if you're not a part of a local church, you are not living in line with God's will

345
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
 for your life.

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,120
 And I know there's reasons and you're going, "Yeah, but I just moved here."

347
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,840
 You moved here 18 months ago.

348
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,880
 And you keep shopping, but at least be honest with yourself.

349
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,480
 I am putting on pause being obedient to that part of God's will, which is heartbreaking

350
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,560
 because when you're not listening and being sensitive to what God has already said, it's

351
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,240
 clear.

352
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,520
 You're going to be less fluent in the commands and additional unknown will that he has for

353
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 your life.

354
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,920
 And so getting connected, plugged into a local church, that doesn't have to be here.

355
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,240
 There's a lot of great churches in Dallas.

356
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,960
 In fact, if you already have a home church, we always say, "Go deeper into your church."

357
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,560
 We're not about stealing Christians.

358
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,480
 We want you to be the body of Christ wherever you're at.

359
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 If you're not in a home church, welcome home.

360
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,240
 And you can find out more at Next Steps, which will be after the service, I think.

361
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,880
 That's right, it will.

362
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 Okay.

363
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
 So, another one.

364
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 What's it?

365
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,440
 Very clear, this is God's known will for your life.

366
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,800
 Am I living in God's will?

367
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,240
 Am I spreading the gospel that Paul in 2 Timothy chapter 4, verse 5 says, "Do the work of an

368
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
 evangelist."

369
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,320
 In other words, all through scripture, there's applying God's known will.

370
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,920
 You know what God's will is for that broken relationship with that parent who really hurt

371
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 you?

372
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 It's that you would forgive them.

373
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,240
 You know what God's will is for that conflict that you have with that roommate?

374
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
 It's that you would run towards it.

375
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,320
 You know what God's will is for the gossip that you participated in today?

376
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,400
 That you would ask for forgiveness for that.

377
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,960
 Like, there's very clear instructions.

378
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,480
 And if you're gonna be able to detect God's unknown sovereign will in your life, it will

379
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,840
 involve you pursuing to be obedient to his known will in your life.

380
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
 It's like this.

381
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,920
 If my wife sent me to the store and was like, "Hey, I want you to go buy groceries for the

382
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
 kids.

383
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 I want you to get eggs."

384
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 She gave me 10 lists.

385
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,840
 It's on a list, got a list, 10 things that's on there.

386
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,760
 Eggs, you know, milk, baby formula, bread, whatever else is on there.

387
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
 Takes me to the store.

388
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,480
 I get to the store and I'm around shopping.

389
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,880
 She knows that list should probably take me about 45 minutes.

390
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
 An hour goes by.

391
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,020
 Hour and a half goes by.

392
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,360
 She calls me and I'm just wandering around the store.

393
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 And she goes, "Hey, what are you doing?"

394
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,040
 And I'm like, "Well, I'm just kind of wandering the aisles wondering what I should get you

395
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,080
 or wondering what you would have me bring, have me bring home."

396
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,360
 And she says, "Wait, did you lose the list?"

397
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,000
 "No, I got the list right here.

398
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
 Do you have all the 10 things in the basket that I have?"

399
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,240
 I got like three of them, but I'm just wandering around, wondering and kind of looking at,

400
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,600
 "I wonder if she would want this or if she would want this or if this is what she would

401
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
 have for me.

402
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,480
 Let me mosey on over to this aisle.

403
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
 Never been here before.

404
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,160
 Look at all of these makeups."

405
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,020
 And I just wander around thinking and wondering what I should get.

406
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,200
 And I just, an hour, another hour goes by, another hour goes by.

407
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,560
 She goes, "What are you doing?

408
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,400
 I gave you clear instructions and you're not even getting the things that I said to get."

409
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,960
 And yet, so many people spend their life as a Christian doing the same thing.

410
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
 God has given these clear instructions and we wander not around a store but through life

411
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,480
 going, "I'm not doing most of the things he said, but I wonder what God's plan is for

412
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
 me.

413
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:27,280
 And I wonder if, you know, this serendipity moment will happen where I'll finally discover

414
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,060
 he was the one and though he didn't exactly have all the qualities God had, maybe that's

415
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,080
 just something special God has for me."

416
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
 And it's crazy.

417
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,400
 Just like a husband wandering around with a list that clearly has identified, "Hey,

418
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,000
 these are the things to get."

419
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,620
 And yet, sadly, that's how a lot of us live our life.

420
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:58,640
 Because if we're honest, it's just not as sexy to just be faithful and do what God says

421
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,080
 and to seek to be obedient.

422
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,800
 And a date, like he says, like there's part of us that just wants it to be easier and

423
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 different and more clear than that.

424
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 God would say, "I don't know.

425
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
 There's literally words on pages.

426
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,920
 I don't know how to make it any more clear."

427
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,200
 And so if you're going to know his known or unknown will, it's going to involve living

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,840
 obedient to his known will.

429
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,040
 So now I want to go into discerning his unknown will, which is probably the thing that, like

430
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,480
 I said, nobody wants to hear, "Be obedient."

431
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,240
 Everyone wants to know, "Yeah, but how do I know if I got my pancakes in the morning

432
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,460
 and the chocolates look like a picture of a woman?

433
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,840
 If that's a woman, then I'm supposed to go find that day."

434
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
 And so I want to walk through how you can know and discern his unknown will.

435
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,640
 And how do you navigate specifically the grays?

436
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,120
 Like, "Hey, am I supposed to buy this car?

437
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
 Am I supposed to take this job?

438
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,920
 Am I supposed to change jobs?

439
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,580
 Is it okay to be on a dating app?

440
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,140
 Should I get off the dating app?

441
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,080
 What should I do as it relates to this dating relationship?

442
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,620
 Should we break up?

443
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,120
 How generous should I be with my time?

444
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,160
 Should I move to a new city?"

445
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:03,280
 So the second idea is discerning God's unknown will.

446
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,120
 And what I want to do is, I'll explain it like this.

447
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,080
 This past weekend I took my son to a baseball game, and on the way there I did what most

448
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,480
 of us do many times, which is I pull out a maps or pull out a GPS and pull it out and

449
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 get out Waze.

450
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,360
 Do you know what Waze does?

451
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,240
 You probably do, or maps or whatever the Android equivalent of all of these things is.

452
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,040
 It is a global positioning system.

453
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,600
 Now a GPS is something that you have on you and you want to use to get directions to take

454
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,760
 you to a destination.

455
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,100
 And that device will communicate with these satellites that are way up above you.

456
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,840
 And it will get information sent back and forth to help direct you on the journey to

457
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,880
 end up at the destination that you want to.

458
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,320
 And what I want to give handholds on is not a global positioning system, but God's positioning

459
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,360
 system and give you three things that work together if you want to navigate the unknowns

460
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
 of life.

461
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,120
 And you want to know, how am I walking through and how can I discern, is this God's will

462
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
 for my life?

463
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,880
 How you can have greater clarity on that.

464
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,680
 So I'm going to give you, as it relates to point number two, discerning God's unknown

465
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
 will.

466
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,920
 Discerning God's unknown will or decision making, three components of wise decision

467
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,480
 making that all work hand in hand together.

468
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,760
 The first one is G.

469
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 What does that mean?

470
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,680
 It means go to God's word, even if it is not directly addressed in scripture.

471
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,640
 What are the principles that inform the decision and the thing that I'm considering doing?

472
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,680
 In other words, even if it doesn't say you should buy a Tesla, if I'm considering buying

473
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,920
 a Tesla, feels like a better time than ever, if I'm considering that, what would God's

474
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,680
 word have to say about that?

475
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:01,000
 Not about car buying, but about decision making, about finances, about stewardship, that in

476
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,920
 every decision I'm going to first G, go to God's word, and I'm going to begin to ask,

477
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,840
 what are the principles, what are the truths, what are the things that would inform this?

478
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,920
 The Bible says in Proverbs chapter three, verse five and six, "Trust in the Lord with

479
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,640
 all of your heart.

480
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,040
 Do not lean on your own understanding.

481
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:31,960
 In all of your ways, submit to him, and he will make straight your paths."

482
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,640
 The Bible just said, "Hey, don't trust your heart.

483
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,880
 Trust in the Lord with all of the desires and everything that you want as it relates

484
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 to your heart.

485
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,720
 Don't lean on how you think it should go.

486
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,840
 Don't rely on what you think is the best decision.

487
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 Trust that to the Lord."

488
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
 Then it says, "And he will make your path straight."

489
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
 You know what that means?

490
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,200
 It means God will make it clear when you do that what to do.

491
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,520
 The more you begin to go, "Hey, I'm going to rely on what God, what would he say as

492
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,120
 it relates to this decision, and how would he speak and inform with the principles from

493
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,260
 scripture to what I should do?"

494
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,360
 It said, "Don't trust your heart."

495
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,800
 It said, "Trust God with your heart."

496
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,520
 This is why the advice that can't be, like if you grew up in the '90s or even in the

497
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,760
 2000s, if you've watched a Disney movie ever, the advice has been given to you of, "Listen

498
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
 to your heart."

499
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,960
 The Bible says, "The person who listens to their heart is a fool."

500
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:31,880
 It says this in Proverbs 28, 26, "He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in

501
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
 wisdom is kept safe."

502
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,160
 It says, "The heart is deceitful."

503
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
 It will deceive you.

504
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,720
 That's why you end up in relationships with guys that you never should have been in a

505
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,280
 relationship and you just thought, "Man, I'm going to turn the mission field to him and

506
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,760
 tell him about Jesus and it'll be great and maybe this is what God's will for me is."

507
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,000
 It's blatant that's not his will, but your heart can deceive you.

508
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,540
 That's why we go to scripture in verse 9 of chapter 17 of Jeremiah, "The heart is deceitful

509
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,280
 above everything else and beyond cure."

510
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,640
 So here's what I mean by, "Hey, what principles would God have that would inform this?"

511
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,760
 Where it's not in chapter 14 of John, you're debating, "Do I go Ernst and Young or Deloitte?"

512
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,540
 And you flip it open and you're like, "And then Peter went to Deloitte and decided,"

513
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,920
 because that's not how you apply scripture to that.

514
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,320
 But let's say you're deciding over taking a job here in Dallas or taking a job in your

515
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,080
 hometown Nashville and one's with Deloitte and one's with Ernst and Young.

516
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,400
 A way that you can know, "Man, am I living inside of God's will?" is by saying, "Hey,

517
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,920
 what principles would inform this?

518
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,900
 And what are the variables involved and how would I make that decision?"

519
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:55,280
 So if one job is back home and it makes less money, the world would say, "No, I mean you

520
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,240
 take the job that's here.

521
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
 Take the more money.

522
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,680
 At the end of the day, here's how you make a decision.

523
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
 The dollar amount."

524
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,480
 But the Bible would say, "He who chases after riches is a fool."

525
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,160
 It would also say that you and I, maybe you have somebody in your family back in Nashville

526
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,440
 or wherever you're from and there's a job opportunity back there and it may not be as

527
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,080
 much money, but you have somebody in your family who's terminally sick.

528
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,280
 You have a parent.

529
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,160
 Maybe it's a single parent.

530
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,160
 You're reading the Bible and you're going, "Man," he says in 1 Timothy chapter 5, "Whoever

531
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,440
 doesn't provide for the needs of their family is worse than an unbeliever."

532
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
 He's denied the faith.

533
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,280
 And you come to the conviction by going to God's Word and going, "I think I'm supposed

534
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,100
 to move back home to care for my family."

535
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,840
 Maybe you're deciding on whether or not to move to another city and a bad reason or outside

536
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,760
 of God's will or not necessarily I can be confident this is God's will is just, "You

537
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
 know what?

538
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 I've been in Dallas for a minute.

539
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
 Let's try Phoenix.

540
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,320
 I just want to kind of get out and sell my oats and I just want to mix it up."

541
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,680
 Am I saying that's wrong or sinful?

542
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,520
 No, I'm just saying it's a very different thing than you saying, "Hey, I'm going to

543
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 move to Phoenix or Dallas because as I read the Bible, I'm living in an environment where

544
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,760
 I don't have good Christian community and so every day I try to get plugged in.

545
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,040
 There just aren't opportunities where there's other young men or other young women like

546
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:27,680
 me and so I'm going to move my life as inconvenient as it is in order to be connected to a place

547
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:35,160
 that is going to feed my faith, that I'm going to make this decision not based on just a

548
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,720
 whim but on His word."

549
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,960
 When you do that, you will experience peace that I'm living according to what God in His

550
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,360
 scripture has called me to do.

551
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,080
 In order to do that, I've got to know God's word.

552
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,560
 The first thing is we go to God's word.

553
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
 Maybe you're thinking about breaking up.

554
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,600
 How would you breaking up be informed by God's word?

555
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,280
 Because it's not going to say, "Hey, and then you should make sure you break up and you

556
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,560
 take it to TCBY."

557
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,080
 But it may say, you should probably do that in reverse order by the way, it may say that,

558
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,040
 "Hey, this person is not helping your faith.

559
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,040
 They're hindering it."

560
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,280
 That would be a reason where Paul says in 2 Timothy chapter 1, "Fan the flame of your

561
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 faith."

562
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,160
 Where you go, "Man, if I'm just honest, they're not helping me run towards Jesus.

563
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,920
 They're holding me back."

564
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,720
 And now you're biblically informed or you're operating underneath God's will.

565
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,000
 A reason to not would just be, you know, they have all the qualities God says to look for

566
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
 but I just have fear of commitment issues.

567
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,160
 And if that's true, maybe you should break up and work on your fear of commitment issues

568
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,000
 and not date anybody.

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,200
 But first we go to God's word.

570
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,800
 The second is we pray for directions, so GP, we pray for direction.

571
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,880
 James chapter 1 verse 5 says, "If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God.

572
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,600
 God gives generously to all without finding faults and it will be given to him."

573
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,400
 That the Holy Spirit communicates to us through prayers.

574
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's crazy how often people will be wrestling with a decision and they're wondering, "What

575
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,400
 I should do and what we should do, where I should live, where I should move in or move

576
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,680
 out?"

577
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,360
 And I'll ask, "Have you prayed about it?

578
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,560
 Have you got alone and asked God, 'Man, would you speak to me?

579
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,760
 Have you fasted?

580
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,360
 Have you sought through the scriptures and asked God, 'Hey, I don't want to operate according

581
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,960
 to just what I want and I can easily convince myself this is the right decision.

582
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,660
 I don't want to do anything without you informing it, God.'"

583
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,240
 And maybe the step for you is to go and tonight alone in your room, in your car at some point

584
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,840
 is just go, "God, what would you have?

585
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,080
 I'm listening."

586
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:00,160
 And before you even maybe even speak or I even feel like it's you, the answer is yes.

587
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,160
 Now know that God never speaks in a way that contradicts his word.

588
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,600
 But GP, I'm going to go and I'm going to seek out count or I'm going to go pray for direction,

589
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,080
 the second one, and then finally ask that we seek wise counsel.

590
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,240
 The Bible says that you and I are to seek out other men and women who are godly, wise

591
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
 counselors.

592
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,800
 How do I know if someone's a godly, wise counselor?

593
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,880
 They counsel according to God's word.

594
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,600
 You could be in a community group all day long that doesn't open the Bible.

595
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,080
 Candidly, a lot of you are.

596
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,360
 And you get together and it's like, "Well, here's what I think you should do and here's

597
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
 what I think you should do."

598
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:44,660
 As lovingly as I could tell you, you should not care what you think you should do.

599
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,280
 You should care what God thinks you should do.

600
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,800
 You shouldn't care what your friends think you should do.

601
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,460
 Unless they're telling you, "Here's what I think God would have you do."

602
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
 And so we seek wise counsel.

603
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
 The Bible says this.

604
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,920
 There's so many verses, I can't include them all, but, "The way of a fool seems right to

605
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
 him."

606
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,240
 Fools never operate thinking, "I'm a fool."

607
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,640
 They think, "No, I think I'm right, bro.

608
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,120
 I think I got this."

609
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,860
 They always think it seems right.

610
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,840
 But a wise man listens to advice.

611
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,920
 Proverbs 15, 22, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed."

612
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,080
 One of the ways God speaks is the word of God and then with the people of God.

613
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,320
 Candidly, this is probably the reason I'm moving quick, that my wife and I are married

614
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
 today.

615
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,560
 10 years ago, almost to the date, we got engaged.

616
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:39,720
 About this time, 10 years ago, I had moments of panic like I had never in my life to that

617
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
 point experienced.

618
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,440
 And everyone tells you, you know, you're like, you know, it's the classic cold feet.

619
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,360
 You know, like when you get it and everyone's like, "This is just cold feet."

620
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,920
 Everyone gets this and you're like, "No, they are frigid down there.

621
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,080
 I am freezing and freaking out."

622
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:59,040
 And I just remember a community coming along me and going, "Like, why are you concerned?

623
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,360
 And is any of the concerns that you have, are they biblical?

624
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,920
 We're not saying God's commanded you have to marry anybody, but you've been dating somebody

625
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,160
 who's a godly woman who loves Jesus, who has the criteria.

626
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
 We understand it.

627
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,560
 Does she not have any of the criteria that God says to look for in a spouse?"

628
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,080
 And I was like, "No, no, she has all of those things.

629
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
 Does she love Jesus?

630
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,720
 Man, she loves Jesus like no one I've ever met."

631
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,600
 "Well, then why would you hit an ejection button?"

632
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,640
 "I don't know, I'm just afraid."

633
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,880
 And I remember they said something, I don't even know if this is good advice, but they

634
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
 were like, "Here's what we're gonna do.

635
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
 You got two weeks.

636
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,440
 Two weeks, you can panic all you want, but in two weeks, you make a decision and you're

637
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,400
 either moving forward or you're moving off of it."

638
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,240
 And it did something in my heart.

639
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
 It's like in those two weeks, I was like, "Oh, I'm putting this to rest right now."

640
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
 Because I could just play the tape and just freak out all day long, or I could trust God's

641
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,720
 word and go, "God, this is who you say to look for.

642
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,320
 And I love her.

643
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
 And I'm gonna get married to her."

644
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,840
 But it was the gift of community around us that really saved me from making one of the

645
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,840
 worst decisions I could have ever made her.

646
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,360
 Thankfully, it didn't.

647
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,240
 But we go to God's word, we seek him in prayer, we pray for direction, and then we seek wise

648
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
 counselor.

649
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,480
 That's God's positioning system in your life.

650
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,920
 Here's some real quick questions for the gray areas of life, just in addition to all of

651
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
 that.

652
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
 Will this help my faith?

653
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,620
 So if you're stuck, here's questions, four of them specifically.

654
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,640
 Will this move?

655
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,520
 Will watching this show, will making this purchase, will changing these jobs, will listening

656
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,760
 to this song, will going to the bachelor party, will this help my faith?

657
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,820
 First Corinthians 10, 23 says, "Everything's permissible."

658
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,800
 Not everything is beneficial.

659
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
 There's certain things, they may not be sin, but they're not gonna help your faith.

660
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,360
 Will this tempt someone else to sin?

661
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,840
 First Corinthians 8 says, "I will not exercise my freedom and become a temptation for other

662
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
 people."

663
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
 So should you go to the bachelor party?

664
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,960
 Man, I don't know.

665
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,120
 Is it with your frat brothers from college that don't know Jesus and it's in Vegas at

666
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
 a strip club?

667
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
 Probably not.

668
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,640
 In fact, I'm gonna go hard pass on that one.

669
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,360
 But if it's with your community group guys at a lake house and you're coming together

670
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,200
 and supporting and encouraging one another, maybe so.

671
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,660
 So will it tempt anybody else to sin?

672
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,280
 Could it hurt the ability to share my faith at work as it relates to the decisions you

673
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
 make, the happy hours you go to, the way that you dress?

674
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
 Is it hurting or helping your ability to share your faith?

675
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,920
 Paul in First Corinthians 10 says, "I'm not seeking my own good, but that many would be

676
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
 saved."

677
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,000
 Number four, what would most honor God?

678
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,640
 That question may be the only question you need.

679
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,480
 It's a pretty piercing question.

680
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,680
 Hey, I know all the things on the table, but what is the most God-honoring thing I could

681
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
 do?

682
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,680
 First Corinthians 10 says, "Do everything to bring honor to God."

683
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,440
 It's the word glory.

684
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,720
 But to bring the most honor to God.

685
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,240
 I went, like I said, to this Rangers game and I'm about to land the plane.

686
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,680
 And while we were there, we sat in this section, in the section, I'm with my son.

687
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,200
 And we entered into it and there were just open seats all throughout our section.

688
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
 And you could sit in any of the seats that were there.

689
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,760
 You just had to stay in your section.

690
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,800
 So we kind of moved around throughout, just different innings throughout the baseball

691
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,000
 game at the Rangers game.

692
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,480
 In life, in a lot of arenas for Christians, I just want to give you a pressure release

693
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,360
 valve.

694
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,680
 There's things that scripture's not blatantly, doesn't speak to.

695
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,520
 You may have two good things in front of you.

696
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,240
 And oftentimes we think of God's will as like this one thing.

697
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,280
 And if I didn't do it that day, the domino hit and then I've missed it ever since that

698
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
 time.

699
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,120
 I've been doing this for 18 years because I said no to that one hangout, I've been missing

700
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
 the will of God.

701
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,200
 God's will is not like a spot.

702
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,560
 It's not like a seat at a game.

703
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
 It's like a section.

704
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,080
 Are you supposed to marry her?

705
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
 I don't know.

706
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,760
 Does she have the qualities that God says to look for in the Bible?

707
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,080
 Because if she does, then the answer is you're within the parameters God has set up.

708
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,560
 Are you working a job that you're supposed to work at?

709
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
 I don't know.

710
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,000
 Does it allow you to provide for your family?

711
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,920
 Does it allow you to proclaim the gospel, to be a light in a dark place?

712
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,960
 Does it rob your ability to be connected to a church, to serve people?

713
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,720
 Those are questions you've got to ask because there's a lot of times you're within the section

714
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,000
 and we focus on man, am I in the right seat?

715
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,240
 And there's a lot of freedom as it relates to a lot of issues that man, you don't have

716
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
 to marry him.

717
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,260
 He's God the guy.

718
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,920
 He's in the section and you could search for the right seat for your whole life.

719
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,560
 You're just not going to have that clarity beyond this is the type of person to look

720
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,720
 for.

721
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,800
 Are you in the right job?

722
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,320
 God would say it's about how you work at your job.

723
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
 You're in the right section.

724
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,560
 Conclusion, how do I know if I'm missing the will of God?

725
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,880
 Am I living in obedience to his known will?

726
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,160
 Because if I'm not, I'm missing the will of God.

727
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,920
 Like I mentioned earlier with the GPS thing, on the way to the game, we took a turn and

728
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,080
 I was following it and I realized it was one of those terms where you didn't even realize

729
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,300
 you were headed the wrong direction.

730
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,120
 It looked like you were taking the right exit and then you quickly see, oh man, I am headed

731
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,860
 the wrong direction.

732
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,200
 And we've all been there before, probably you have, where you see recalculating and

733
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,720
 it gives you the new path and it shows you where to go.

734
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,640
 A message like this I know makes a lot of us feel like I have blown God's will from

735
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,480
 my life.

736
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,360
 I have spent years, I have spent relationships, I have done things that were contradictory

737
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
 to God's clear will for my life.

738
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,860
 And here's what I want you to know.

739
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,720
 You're not too far gone.

740
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,400
 You're not at a place where you can't be brought back, but you've got to stop listening to

741
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,480
 yourself and start listening to the word of God, to the divine instructions that are saying

742
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,840
 recalculating, I'm not done with you, we're going to get back to that direction.

743
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,200
 But you've got to stop trusting your way of doing things or you're going to end up at

744
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,980
 a place that you don't want to be, any more than a person driving going, oh, Waze has

745
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,720
 no idea where the stadium is.

746
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,520
 I'm going my own way.

747
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,300
 And that choice is the only one that you can make.

748
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,960
 And it's going to go, I'm surrendering, not to a church, not to a person, but God, I'm

749
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,640
 going to surrender the Savior of the world, Jesus my Savior, and to his word that he gave

750
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,200
 me because he loves me so much.

751
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,840
 He showed that love by dying in my place on a cross.

752
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:58,680
 And you've got to make the decision, are you going to keep going or surrender and experience

753
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,280
 God's will for your life?

754
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,440
 If you're not a follower of Jesus, here's his will for your life.

755
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,840
 You're in a church on a Tuesday night, July 12th, 2022, because eternity is real and God

756
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,320
 gave his life for you on a cross.

757
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,400
 And one day in all of eternity, you're going to stand before him and you'll have no excuse

758
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,280
 to say, God, I never heard that you loved me and gave your life for me on the cross.

759
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,040
 I never heard the message that Jesus was the Savior of the world.

760
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,400
 God sent into earth and he gave his life for me.

761
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
 He gave it for everyone.

762
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,200
 He gave it for everything wrong I've ever done.

763
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,440
 And no amount of good deeds will ever earn my way to have a relationship with God.

764
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,080
 Only by trusting in Jesus can I have eternal life.

765
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,120
 You can't stand before him and say, I've never heard that before.

766
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,440
 Because today is his day of saying, July 10th, July 12th, 2022, you were introduced to the

767
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,200
 Savior of the world who's been pursuing you from the moment you took your first breath

768
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,320
 until the moment you take your last.

769
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,160
 And the choice is yours to receive that and step into his will for your life.

770
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,720
 Let me pray.

771
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:18,340
 Father, I pray for anyone who's carrying shame, anyone who's carrying baggage from decisions

772
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,500
 and ways that all of us have fallen short of the standard and fallen short of your plan

773
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:30,000
 and your will for our life, that you would give us the conviction to surrender to your

774
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:41,360
 word and to reach a destination through your divine direction, coming alongside of us,

775
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,400
 helping us walk with you, experience the life that you gave your life for.

776
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,200
 I pray for anyone who's never trusted you with their eternal life and with this life,

777
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,960
 would be their night. In Christ's name, Amen.
