[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.480]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.720]   Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.400]   Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Fayetteville, Phoenix,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.480]   Menhill, North Carolina, Cedar Rapids,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.840]   wherever you're tuning in from.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.120]   Houston, let's go.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.520]   Stroh's, close it out.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.440]   Hey, we are wrapping up this series,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.520]   Ready to Offer Romance,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.720]   as we explore Song of Solomon
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.000]   and this relationship between this couple.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.560]   And I thought I would start with a couple
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.260]   that I came across, I found out about this past week,
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.900]   named Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.720]   Who's heard of Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher in here?
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   Nobody, guarantee it.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.120]   Here's who Herbert and Zelmyra Fisher are.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960]   They hold the record for the longest marriage
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.220]   in the modern era.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.200]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.760]   Hold on, hold on.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.240]   You don't even know these people.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.640]   Why are you clapping right now?
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.880]   These two got married in 1924
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.760]   and were married for 87 years
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.440]   till he passed away in 2011.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.740]   They got married at 18 and 17.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.880]   And when they did, in 1924, think about that,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.520]   Calvin Coolidge was president.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760]   Most of you guys don't even know who Calvin Coolidge is.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.080]   You think that's a cartoon.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.520]   Babe Ruth was the hero of the day.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.240]   The Great Depression had not happened.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.920]   The Roaring Twenties was taking place.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.360]   We're about to be in the Roaring Twenties again
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.960]   and this couple, the woman, just died off in 2013.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920]   But for 87 years, they went through two,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.880]   I know, I know, what's in their genetics, for real?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.600]   What vitamins and what are they eating?
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.980]   They went through 15 presidential administrations.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.860]   They survived the Great Depression, World War II,
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.700]   the Korean War, the Vietnam War.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.640]   They were in their 60s and married together
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.660]   and had over four decades of marriage
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.420]   when we landed on the moon.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.240]   (laughs)
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.100]   That is crazy.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.160]   They were in their mid to late 60s
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.860]   whenever JFK was assassinated and they just died in 2013.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.980]   It is the longest recorded marriage in modern history.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.340]   To find a marriage similar, you would have to almost
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.640]   go back to Abraham and Sarah in the Bible.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.520]   That is how straight up long these two were together
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.420]   and they had a marriage that clearly lasted.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.220]   They had a relationship that far exceeds anything
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.660]   most of us, all of us likely will ever experience
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.740]   in marriage, but what does that have to do
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.240]   with where we're going tonight?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.420]   Well, in a similar way that their marriage
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.260]   was able to stand the test of time.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.620]   This series has been devoted to helping create
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.740]   and helping us build a foundation for dating,
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.620]   for relationships, for romance from God's word
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.100]   so that you and I can have the best chance
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.860]   at having a marriage that succeeds.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.300]   And this was almost as if it were a marriage made in heaven.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.260]   I mean, that's incredible.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.020]   And tonight we're gonna wrap up this series
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.740]   and what I wanna do is I wanna give two takeaways
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.420]   and drive 'em home as clear as I can from God's word
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.860]   in this final chapter of Song of Solomon
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.100]   on what a marriage made from heaven should look like.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.560]   Inside of the room right now,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.700]   most of you will be married in the next 10 years.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.260]   That's not a guarantee and it's not a promise.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.940]   Statistically, the odds are in your favor.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.820]   And so if that's true, and there are a few decisions
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.260]   in life other than trusting and walking with Jesus
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.620]   and who you're gonna worship that are more
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.660]   gonna significantly impact your life than who you marry.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.260]   And so if you can go in knowing this is what God says
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.540]   marriage is about, this is the type of relationship
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.500]   you should be looking for,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.260]   who would not want to experience that?
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.500]   A fool, is who.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.820]   And so we're gonna talk tonight about the last two things
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.620]   from what God says, you wanna have a marriage made
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.000]   in heaven, here's what it looks like.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.100]   And let me just say something really quick
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.020]   before we dive in.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.580]   There's a lot of talk in our culture
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   about what marriage is and what it isn't.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.620]   When it comes to the arena of marriage,
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.380]   biblically God says you and I don't get to say
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.720]   what it is or what it isn't or what it should look like
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.260]   because he defines marriage.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.800]   And from the very beginning, he orchestrated
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.920]   this incredible thing that he said,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.320]   marriage is gonna be a picture and a metaphor
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.300]   of my love for the church.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.900]   So you can add rules, change rules, do whatever you want,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900]   but when you step in the arena of marriage,
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.860]   it's like you're stepping on God's territory,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.280]   as though all of life was not already there.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.640]   But in a weird way, it's like you're walking
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.220]   and if you were gonna step towards marriage,
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.740]   like I said, most of you are, you need to know
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.780]   you are stepping towards holy ground,
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.740]   like take off your sandals type of holy ground.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.820]   And what he says about marriage and what it should look like
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.260]   is gonna define what those of us who experience
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.620]   a marriage made in heaven are gonna have in our relationship.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.900]   So we're gonna continue the series,
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.260]   we're gonna look at Song of Solomon, chapter eight,
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.160]   I'm gonna give two takeaways.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.780]   I'm gonna read through the text, unpack it,
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.360]   we're gonna have two takeaways from this text,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.680]   really from the book in general,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.000]   and we'll get you guys out of here with enough time
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.800]   to see the Astros clinch the world series, how about that?
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.400]   All right, we'll start in verse five of chapter eight.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   We continue it, in case you're joining us for the first time,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.640]   here's what Song of Solomon is.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.940]   It's like the Romeo and Juliet of the Bible.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.680]   It is a book that was included in the scripture
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880]   that God celebrates romance between one man, one woman.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.840]   Who's the one man?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.640]   His name is King Solomon, he's the king.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.820]   His married girl, or his boo, was named Shulamite,
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.300]   or Shulamith, and they had this relationship
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.320]   we've traced for the last handful of weeks.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.620]   If you missed it, you can go check it out on the Porch app,
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.600]   on iTunes, or podcasts, and catch up with us.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.800]   But they've just had this journey where they went from
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.360]   not in a relationship, to dating, to engaged,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.140]   married, honeymoon night, and conflict,
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.980]   and we've just explored.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.220]   And tonight, we're gonna get into the
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.600]   till death do us part part of the song.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.920]   And it is a song, just to remind you,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   so it goes back and forth.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.720]   It's very poetic, and it's like the guy sings something,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.640]   the girl sings something, every once in a while,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.220]   the friends kind of chime in and give their two cents too.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.400]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse five,
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.280]   where the friends chime in as they see this couple
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.500]   coming back from this bed and breakfast weekend getaway
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.800]   that they had had we covered last week.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   So here's it, verse five.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   Friends speaking.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.720]   "Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.600]   "leaning on her beloved?"
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.920]   So who is that girl riding in that chariot,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   she's leaning on her boy, who is that?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.680]   And they know it's rhetorical, it's her.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.880]   And she chimes in and begins to speak to her husband.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880]   "Under the apple tree where I awakened you,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.140]   "or I aroused you," your translation may have.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.780]   "There your mother was in labor with you,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.760]   "there she who bore you was in labor."
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   She basically brings up what feels incredibly awkward
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.680]   and weird to us, but she basically says,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.960]   like man, underneath, it's an expression
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.680]   of the continuing legacy of love and relationships
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.760]   from their generation to their parents' generation.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.400]   That means, that's like weird for us in this day and age
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.960]   and cultural and Hebrew, it would have been a affirming
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.840]   and connecting to their legacy of their family tradition.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.040]   And she's speaking erotically, as we talked about,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.120]   apple trees having been seen as an aphrodisiac,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   making love in this particular place.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.140]   "Set me," verse six, "as a seal on your heart,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.680]   "or as a seal on your arm."
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.460]   A seal was like a stamp that someone would have,
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.880]   like in that day and age, people would have a seal
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.480]   and it would be like, this is a declaration,
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.640]   this is my possession, so I'm putting my seal
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.000]   on different things that I own,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.320]   so that people can know that it's mine.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.680]   Same thing you do at your apartment with your roommates,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.440]   when you write your initials on the milk,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.220]   and you're like, hey, nobody else eat this milk,
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.400]   'cause it's got my initials on it,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.680]   who ate my milk in here, or somebody borrowed my clothes,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.320]   and I clearly put my initials on side of it,
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.560]   'cause I'm declaring what?
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   That's mine, my possession.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.640]   She's saying, I want you to put that type of thing
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.760]   on your heart with me.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.480]   Like, all of your affections are mine,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.560]   and I'm all of yours, and put it on your arm
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.760]   so that people can publicly know and declare
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.120]   through your actions that we are one another's,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   I'm possessed, and I possess my boy.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.100]   Verse seven, "For love is as strong as death,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.380]   "and jealousy is as fierce as the grave.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.000]   "It's flashes are the flashes of fire,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.640]   "and the very flame of the Lord."
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.160]   Love is as strong as death,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.660]   as in it lasts all the way to the grave.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.280]   Jealousy is as fierce as the grave,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   in other words, death and the grave is not selective
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.000]   in who it chooses, and it's gonna, it takes all of us.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.320]   So jealousy, in the context of marriage,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   there's like a righteous jealousy that takes place
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.000]   where it is not selective towards being protective
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.920]   of the person that it loves.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.760]   What do I mean by that?
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.240]   Like, inside of the context of marriage,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.520]   there's a righteous jealousy where you're like,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.240]   hey, this is my girl, nobody else,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.480]   I don't care who you are, is getting near her
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.240]   or spending one-on-one time or talking to her
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.640]   like her husband talks to her.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.000]   I don't care if you're my best friend
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.480]   or if you're in my family or any of that,
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.420]   I'm protective, and it says it's as fierce,
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.800]   as jealousy is as fierce as the grave.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.240]   Verse eight, or verse seven,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.920]   "Many waters or trials when storms of life come
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.980]   "cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.720]   "If a man were to offer, offered for love
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.280]   "all the wealth of his house,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.840]   "he would be utterly despised."
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.640]   That wealth, or that love is such a thing
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.600]   that you can't buy it.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.160]   This would be where you insert the Alicia Keys songs.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   Some people want it all.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.360]   I don't want anything at all,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.760]   but your love is basically what she's saying.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.800]   Verse eight, this is where it takes
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.160]   what I think is the weirdest turn in the entire book.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   And it goes to like a flashback
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.600]   that her brothers introduced where it says this.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.160]   We have a little sister and she has no breasts.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.400]   And you're going, what are they talking about?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.780]   She's flashing back, and I'll tell you
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.480]   why I say that in a second.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.640]   But it's her brothers speaking
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.400]   and speaking of an earlier time in life
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.840]   and by no breasts, they're not like throwing shade at her.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.920]   They're saying she hasn't gone through puberty yet
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.160]   and we have a little sister.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   Verse eight, "What shall we do for our sister
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.520]   "on the day when she is spoken for?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   "If she is a wall, we will build on her
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.120]   "battlements of silver."
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   In other words, if she protects herself as a wall,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.480]   talking about her purity,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.840]   then we're gonna put battlements,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.560]   you know, decorative battle stuff.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.800]   Silver doesn't, you don't make silver for battle
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.720]   or for protection, it's just kind of for decoration.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   "But if she is a door, we will enclose her
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.600]   "with boards of cedar."
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.440]   Dude, I love that.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.480]   If you have a sister in the room,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.360]   you know what these guys are saying right here.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.200]   What is a door?
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.400]   A door is something that opens to give access
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.440]   to other people.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.680]   So the brothers are going,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.440]   hey, if she can't learn to control herself,
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.400]   we are going to board that door up.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   That's what they're saying.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.720]   She says, verse 10, "I was a wall."
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.480]   So that's why we say it's a flashback.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.040]   "And my breasts are like towers."
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.880]   Dang, girl.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.080]   "Then I was in his eyes like one who finds peace."
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.240]   This verse, man, there's so much in this passage
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.080]   that's beautiful.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.720]   One is that some scholars think she's like,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   she's taking a jab at the brothers who were like,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.600]   oh yeah, I was a sister with no breasts,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.640]   now I got some towers.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.880]   And the other thing is that she says,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.400]   "I was like one who found peace," or shalom.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   And the word shalom is the same translation
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.720]   for the name Solomon.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.880]   It was as though Solomon found in me peace
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.000]   and I found my Solomon or my peace through this relationship.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.120]   Solomon had a vineyard, so then she uses a metaphor
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.080]   to talk about their relationship.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.380]   And she says this, "Solomon," that's her husband,
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.040]   "had a vineyard at Baal Hamon," that's just a place.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.120]   "He leased out the vineyard to keepers,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.000]   "and each one was to bring for its fruit
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.520]   "a thousand pieces of silver.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.920]   "My vineyard," so she says in the same way,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.960]   "My vineyard," talking about her body
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.080]   all throughout the book, we've addressed her vineyard
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.840]   as her body, "is my very own, and is before me,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.440]   "you, O Solomon, may have the thousand
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   "and the keepers of the fruit 200."
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.880]   She's talking about her body, saying,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.160]   "I'm giving all of the fruits of myself to you."
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.940]   And he says, "You who dwell in the gardens
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.280]   "with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice."
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.360]   She says, the last line of the book,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.520]   "Come away, my beloved, be like a gazelle
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   "or a young stag on the spice-laden mountains,"
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.000]   talking about her breasts again.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.360]   She's basically like, hey, we're gonna hit repeat,
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.960]   make love to you all night long,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.440]   and keep that track rolling,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.200]   is essentially where the book ends.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.240]   Now, what I wanna do is I wanna cover two takeaways
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.800]   from something that we learned from this couple
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.660]   in this passage, and really throughout the entire book,
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.000]   that are the marks of a marriage that is made from heaven,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.840]   or the type of marriage that God wants you to have.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   And the first one is this, marriage is a covenant.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.880]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.200]   This is really, really important.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.320]   What is a covenant?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.680]   That's a word that maybe you've heard before,
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.600]   and people are talking, they'll kinda throw it out there.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.960]   Biblically, you can look at Hebrews 9,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.680]   you look all throughout the Bible.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.880]   A covenant is a relationship that two parties enter into,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.440]   and it is only able to end by death of one party.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   It is a covenant that people enter,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.840]   and it's till death do us part every single time.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.180]   You cannot get out of it in the same way
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.520]   you would get out of a contract.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.400]   A lot of you guys are in contracts with AT&T,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.740]   and you're like, dude, if they could beat Verizon,
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.960]   or if Verizon could beat them,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.300]   I would go over to them in a heartbeat,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.240]   and that's a contract.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.920]   A covenant is a relationship that you mutually enter into
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.440]   that can only end in death.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.000]   Marriage, biblically, is a relationship
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   where two people enter into that can only be ended by death.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.520]   It is the fact that it is a covenant,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   and the reason the text says love is as strong as death,
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.000]   it matches it all the way to the grave.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.180]   They are entered into a relationship that is a covenant
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.560]   that lasts an entire lifetime.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.400]   That's what their marriage is.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.480]   That's what marriage biblically is.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   This is why the couple can have the mark of jealousy
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.680]   and it be a righteous thing,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.320]   because they've entered in and they've agreed,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.980]   man, I'm his, he's mine for life.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.960]   I have possession over this person,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.140]   and there can be a righteous jealousy to that.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.080]   You may think like jealousy every time is all bad.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.180]   That's not true.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.080]   Jealousy can be, hey, I rightfully have rights
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.520]   over this thing in this marriage.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.680]   God, we're told, has jealousy over you.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.280]   You know that?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.440]   That he yearns jealously over his people
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.940]   who are rightfully his.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.280]   Now, what is not righteous jealousy,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.960]   let me just say this, 'cause this probably is something
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.080]   that consistently one of the things that gets asked
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.160]   by people, what's not righteous jealousy
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.280]   and what this does not apply to is those of us in the room
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.760]   who are in dating relationships who jealousy
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.680]   is just kind of like our, we just claim it
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.840]   as that's just kind of who I am.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.360]   Now, I need to see your phone and see who you've been
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.000]   texting or see what DMs, you know, other girls
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.480]   or you've been passing on to other girls are.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.080]   That type of jealousy is not what the Bible's talking about.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.800]   And generally speaking, let me just say something,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.540]   like that type of jealousy or the type of jealousy
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.800]   where the guy's like, hey, I can't believe
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.080]   that you were talking to that guy.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.400]   You know, I'm about to go punch that dude right in the face.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.760]   You're like, what, easy, he was taking my order
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.480]   at Starbucks, that's the guy that I was talking,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   why are you gonna punch?
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.000]   That type of jealousy is not what the Bible says
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.080]   is a healthy or righteous, typically good thing.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.440]   In fact, let me just be like a friend here
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.600]   and a big brother to you.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.200]   Typically, when I hear someone talk about,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.360]   hey, my girlfriend is just so controlling,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.720]   she wants to see my phone, she wants to see
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.640]   who I've been talking to, or the guy or the girl's
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.760]   describing about how my boyfriend, he just like struggles
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.000]   with rage or jealousy, those are consistently red flags,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.560]   and if you are experiencing those, you should be concerned.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.400]   Why do I say that?
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.300]   Almost every time that that's happening,
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.220]   one of two things is happening.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.600]   Either the girl, in that scenario, if she's the jealous one
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.880]   or the guy, if they're the jealous one,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.200]   they are using, or there's some baggage from the past
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.400]   that they have just not worked through,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.800]   and so they hide behind the banner of,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.220]   I'm just slow to trust, and it's because they haven't healed
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.280]   from their past baggage.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.660]   The Bible says that love always trusts
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.200]   in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.680]   So as a Christian, you do not get the excuse
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.420]   to hide behind, I just don't trust people easily.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.360]   So if they're in that scenario, there's either baggage
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.620]   from their past or current baggage of their present.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.160]   Maybe somebody cheated on them, something painful happened
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.900]   in their past, but generally, it's like, dude,
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.820]   she hasn't healed from that, or you are a sleazeball
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.280]   and not trustworthy, and it's typically
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.920]   one of those two scenarios.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.660]   Either way, it's not a great reflection
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.520]   of the relationship where it's like, oh, no, no, no,
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.000]   she doesn't have any baggage, I'm just a total sleazeball.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.080]   Not a great sign of the relational health.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.160]   So if you're in that scenario, you should at least
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.000]   have some concern and be thoughtful about that.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.840]   Why can I not trust this person?
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.860]   Is it baggage that I need to heal from and you need to own?
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.720]   Or are you dating people who are not trustworthy?
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.480]   And you should not date people who are not trustworthy,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.960]   who are not worthy of your trust,
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.700]   or have not proven worthy of your trust.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.000]   But this, in this covenant context,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.440]   there was an appropriate jealousy that was being
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   displayed here because it was a covenant.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.240]   So marriage is a covenant.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.900]   A covenant can only end in death.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.000]   Most of you are gonna get married in the next 10 years.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.500]   You're gonna step into something God says is mine.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.080]   And it is a relationship that I have said
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.840]   only ends in death.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.960]   Wait, David, what about divorce?
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.720]   Doesn't that end a relationship?
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.600]   Can't a marriage end in divorce?
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   I mean, I've seen all kinds of relationships.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.900]   My parents' marriage ended in a divorce,
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.680]   or a divorce took place in my marriage.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.280]   So am I saying that that actually was not
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.760]   the dissolving of that relationship?
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.880]   Maybe.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.400]   Jesus is asked about marriage in Matthew chapter 19.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.920]   And he's asked by these guys who come up,
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.440]   they're called Pharisees, they're basically like the
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.480]   just kind of religious leaders of the day.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.160]   They're coming to trap Jesus and they go up
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.720]   and they're like, hey, Jesus, what are the scenario
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.400]   and circumstances when it's okay to divorce your wife?
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.480]   And Jesus gives them this answer.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.480]   This is Matthew chapter 19, verse three.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.680]   The Pharisees came up and tested him by asking,
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   And he answered, have you not read, that's Jesus speaking,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.120]   that he who created them from the beginning
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.340]   made them male and female?
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.840]   Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.880]   and hold fast to his wife,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.080]   and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   Therefore, there are no longer two, but they are one flesh.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.320]   What God has joined together, let no man separate.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.400]   People come up, they're like, Jesus, hey,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.480]   what are the circumstances under which it's okay
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.320]   to get a divorce?
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.440]   If they cheat on you, if they are just mean to you,
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.780]   if you just don't like them that day,
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.000]   if you're ready to move on, when is it okay?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.260]   And Jesus, in response to them saying,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.880]   when is it permissible, gives an answer that reflects,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.620]   I'm not even sure it's possible.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.780]   That the state of Texas may recognize your divorce,
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.660]   but that doesn't mean that God does.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.460]   That there may be a scenario where people came together
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.460]   and they're like, hey, you know,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.100]   mutually irreconcilable differences, we're kinda over this,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.220]   and you have stamped it and you have seen it, divorce,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.740]   but that doesn't mean that God says
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.180]   the marriage is over in his eyes,
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.220]   or that that person is free to remarry,
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.360]   because God says, marriage is mine,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.820]   and when you bring those two together,
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.120]   it's as though I fuse them into one,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.020]   and it is hard to un-one what God made one.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.940]   It's like this, there's an old illustration
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.660]   we've used here before, where if I take this,
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.500]   and I'm to pour what represents one person
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.760]   in the relationship, and this is you,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.140]   guys is blue, and ladies, as close as we get to pink,
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.340]   and I pour this in here,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.920]   and then I decided, you know,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.580]   I'm not really digging the whole,
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.300]   what is that, like crimson or maroon,
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.860]   I'm just gonna separate these things back out,
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.220]   and I try to pour the blue back in here
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.600]   and the red back in here, it wouldn't work,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.860]   because they've moved together,
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.980]   and the Bible says, as crazy as this is,
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.900]   and I need you to hear me,
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   'cause this is what you are walking into,
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.180]   that there isn't some like, hey, if this doesn't work out,
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.360]   we'll just hit the ejection button.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.300]   God says, you have moved together in a way
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.040]   that you cannot un-one and separate from one another.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.460]   Now, there are people who disagree,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.740]   or there are people who would say,
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.380]   inside of the Bible, there's two exceptions,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.420]   if they abandon you, or if there's adultery.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.220]   Those would be times where the marriage would dissolve,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.220]   and I don't have time to get into all the different
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.520]   scenarios and opinions, but godly people would disagree,
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.760]   but here's what everyone would agree on.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.180]   Marriage is a big deal to God.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.580]   It is something you should not take lightly.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.740]   He does not take lightly,
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.740]   and he says in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.900]   it is a reflection of me and my love for the church,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.060]   and the reason why you cannot just leave
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.980]   is because I do not just leave,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.100]   and every time a marriage is broken apart,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.060]   especially by Christians, it is an indictment,
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.860]   or it is a poor reflection of what my covenant,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.860]   Jesus speaking, and his love to his bride, the church.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.100]   Marriage is a covenant that only ends in death.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.180]   If you're interested, you can go check out
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.260]   A Real Truth Real Quick by our senior pastor, Todd.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.380]   It's having a real truth real quick.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.220]   It's having a divorce.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.660]   You can find out more answers on specifics of that stuff.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.180]   There's people who disagree on some of the implications,
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.860]   or some gray areas, but no one disagrees.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.420]   Marriage is a big deal.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.460]   In Malachi chapter 2, 16, God says, "I hate divorce."
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.540]   And if you've come from a home like I did,
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.460]   it's no wonder why, because of the pain and the destruction
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.220]   that divorce introduces to the couple, to the children,
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.300]   to the family, to anyone who's involved.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.780]   I feel the pain of divorce at every holiday,
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.980]   as I know many of you do.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.940]   Sadly, more and more, just as a pastor,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.020]   you get to, I'm a part of weddings all the time,
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.820]   and it is a rare thing for me to do a wedding
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.460]   where the bride and the groom both have parents
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.380]   who stay together, and it becomes this whole orchestration
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.620]   of, you know, here's my mom and stepfather,
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.500]   and who's gonna sit where, and who's gonna say
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.480]   her mother and I?
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.440]   And it is a tragic thing, and God, who loves you,
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.860]   doesn't want you to experience that.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.940]   So as someone who is incredibly vested in your success,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.000]   and your future marriage being amazing,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.660]   because marriage is amazing, I want you to go in
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.340]   with eyes wide open, and my whole goal for this talk
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.260]   is for you to go in going, whoa, that's a really big deal,
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.260]   which is exactly how the disciples
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.940]   responded to Jesus' teaching.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.060]   In other words, at the end of Jesus saying that,
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.220]   the disciples would go, whoa, Jesus,
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.340]   that was a little intense.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.860]   If that's the case, maybe it's better to not marry,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.460]   and Jesus isn't like, oh, no, guys, it's the best.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.300]   Are you kidding me?
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.940]   No, you gotta try it, it's so great.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.540]   He just basically kind of walks off.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.660]   He's like, some people can accept it,
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.500]   some people can't, and he walks off.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.020]   But yes, it is a big deal, and you need to know
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.460]   you are entering into a covenant.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.840]   So that's the first thing, that marriage by definition
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.900]   is a covenant.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.820]   The second is that marriage and love,
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.080]   and this is, we're two-point message tonight.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.420]   In marriage, love is a choice.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.580]   So there's a lot of debate, even as I was thinking
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.020]   and working on this message this week,
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.300]   and I know some of you guys right now
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.960]   are disagreeing with me, like, yeah, sometimes it's a choice,
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.260]   but other times it isn't.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.220]   And there's even things that we talk about in culture,
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.940]   we're like, love is a verb, or love is a noun,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.180]   or love is a feeling, or love is,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.820]   these different expressions, it's kind of like,
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.240]   you know, we disagree and we agree,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.780]   and it's kind of all of them, right?
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.240]   No, biblically, love is a choice, and it's a command.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.080]   In marriage.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.020]   What do I mean by that?
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.900]   The word, so this is getting a little bit heady.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.100]   Everybody put the thinking caps on, here we go.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.940]   This is an educated crowd, though, and listening in,
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.520]   I'm confident you've got this.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.960]   In Hebrew, which is the original language
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.500]   Song of Solomon was written, you guys follow me?
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.660]   In the original language, there are three different words
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.540]   in the book of Song of Solomon for love.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.780]   Each of them has a different variation.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.140]   In other words, in Hebrew, there are three ways
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.620]   that you can talk about love, or three types of love.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.540]   In English, we're pretty simple.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.500]   So we just like to use love, so we're like,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.560]   I love chocolate, and I love the astros,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.580]   and I love her, and God, I love you.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.420]   We use the same word.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.020]   In Hebrew, there's different expressions
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.460]   that you would use for different scenarios.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.840]   There's three types of love.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.500]   The first love is called rayah.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.180]   It's in the book, it's a companion love,
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.220]   like you're my companion, my friend, I feel affection.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.080]   You can have this kinda like, hey, we're platonic,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.140]   just bros here, that's the type of love.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.980]   The second type of love is dod.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.960]   This is erotic or sexual love.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.420]   This was like the honeymoon night.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.020]   That's what they were using there, dod, D-O-D.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.060]   The third type of love is the love
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.760]   that they mention in this chapter.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.120]   It's called ahava, A-H-A-V-A.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:34.000]   It is a word that by definition means a love of decision.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.640]   It's a word that literally comes from the root
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.840]   to give of oneself, to decide to give of oneself.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.220]   It is the type of love that says,
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.780]   hey, I see everything messed up,
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.560]   and no matter how hard it gets, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.100]   It's not the erotic love, which can't make a marriage last.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.060]   It's not just a companion, hey, you're my buddy love.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.600]   It is a I am committed and I'm keeping the covenant love.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.160]   That's what the ahava is in that text.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.560]   The ahava is the one that is stronger than death
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.540]   or is as strong as death.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.120]   By definition in here, it is that love is a deciding love.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.840]   It is a choice that you make.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.080]   That's what is mentioned here.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.240]   Biblically, in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.320]   the apostle Paul would pick this up,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.880]   and he would say, hey, husbands,
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.080]   here's how you should think about love.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.500]   Here's what he says in Ephesians chapter five, verse 25.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church,
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.480]   and that he gave himself up for her.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.780]   That's nuts in our day and age.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.620]   Here's what I mean.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.340]   If you think about it, the level of times
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.580]   or the number of times that people are like,
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.700]   look, I just don't love her anymore,
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.740]   or I'm not in love with her anymore,
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.980]   Paul would say, here's what I hear you saying,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.560]   21st century person, you are directly rejecting
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.260]   the command of God in your life.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.760]   You're choosing to say, hey, God,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.280]   choosing to be disobedient to what you command in Bible.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.960]   Think about that.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.640]   Paul would say, look, it's not husbands,
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.240]   love your wife when you are in love,
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.580]   or husbands, love your wife when you feel love.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.600]   It is husbands, love, sacrificially lay down your life
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.740]   for your wife.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.800]   It is a command.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.720]   It is a choice, and in marriage,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.080]   it is not an optional thing.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.520]   It is I'm making the decision.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.600]   I am laying down my life, my desires,
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.800]   and my preferences come second to yours,
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.200]   and mutually doing that together with your spouse.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.160]   Love is a choice.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.840]   It is not a feeling that, hey, I only do this
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.040]   whenever I feel like it.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.340]   Biblically, listen to me.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.600]   Love is a command of God,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.880]   and as soon as you enter into that,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.240]   and this is what makes marriage
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.480]   both amazing and really hard,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.120]   because here's what marriage is.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.920]   It is one day of dying to yourself
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.360]   after the next, after the next, after the next.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.320]   Like, dude, let me be honest.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.960]   Marriage is amazing, 'cause this is the tension that I feel.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.560]   It's like, you don't wanna have people be like,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.240]   oh my gosh, I'm never getting married,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.560]   and you don't want also people to be like,
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.600]   yes, it's amazing, our love will last us through a lifetime.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.560]   You know, it's gonna be great,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.680]   and I want you to walk in with a silver,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.280]   like, marriage is amazing, dude.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.920]   Like, it's incredible, and it's one of the greatest gifts.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.200]   You can have sex whenever you want,
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040]   or whenever they're willing,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.000]   and you can just have an amazing time together,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.800]   and you've got this friend, and you're always,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.760]   like, it's awesome, it's the greatest thing ever,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.280]   and yet it is also really, really hard,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.200]   and one of the reasons it's hard
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   is because love is a command in the Bible
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.320]   where you constantly have to go,
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   I have to die to myself,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.520]   and I'm choosing not to just do what I want in this moment,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.160]   but for the needs of the person in front of me there.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.000]   Here's why this matters,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.580]   because you are going to step into a marriage,
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.200]   and there's gonna come a day you're gonna wake up,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.240]   and you're not gonna feel like loving that person that day,
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.200]   'cause here's what happens in dating.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.960]   Like, in dating, dude, you guys,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.080]   man, you just have no idea, here we go.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.760]   In dating, you're in this stage right now,
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.560]   I remember it, where opposites attract,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.360]   and you're like, oh, man, they're so quiet,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.200]   it's like they're so mysterious over there,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.800]   and everything about 'em, you're like, gosh,
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.680]   and then you get in marriage, and you're like,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.880]   is anything going on in there at all?
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.280]   You're so quiet, and the thing that attracted you,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.400]   all of a sudden, you want to attack them for.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   There was a psychologist that said opposites attract,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.880]   and in a marriage, they attack,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.640]   and so all of a sudden, you go from,
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.800]   man, she's just so fun-loving, and like,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.960]   she's just free-spirit, and I'm just kinda buttoned up,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   and it's just great to have her around,
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.360]   and then you get in marriage,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.680]   and it becomes not like she's so fun-loving,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.640]   it's like, do you ever focus on anything?
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.960]   The guy, you're like, I just love that he's athletic,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.020]   and then you get married, and you're like,
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.320]   all he cares about is sports, that's it,
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.160]   that's all he cares about.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.360]   Whatever the thing that you're like, man,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.480]   this is the thing that I really like about this person,
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.800]   all of a sudden, you find yourself going,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.400]   man, I'm not sure that I like them,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.080]   she's so sweet, turns into,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.380]   she doesn't have an opinion or a backbone at all.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.700]   That's where it begun.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.080]   And in that moment, in those times,
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   and in those scenarios, you have to make the decision,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.720]   I am not going to listen to whatever lies
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   I may be tempted to believe, I love this woman,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.560]   I love this man, and I'm choosing to lay down my wife,
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.440]   to lay down my life, not my wife,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.440]   though if they let you,
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.100]   in marriage, in marriage,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.520]   (laughing)
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.600]   in marriage,
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.740]   I have lost my place.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.620]   You are choosing, hey, I'm putting the needs
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.780]   and the cares of this person in front of me.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:20.400]   The Apostle Paul would say, here's what love does,
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.020]   in 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.900]   a verse that you probably heard before,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.340]   love bears all things.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.020]   (laughing)
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.180]   I apologize, man, I'm gonna get an email for that,
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.900]   let's just get that out of the way, I apologize, okay?
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.300]   Love bears all things, it endures all things,
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.900]   it believes all things.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.640]   Hopes all things, love never ends.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.120]   Love in marriage, I hope you never, ever
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.020]   wonder this question again, is a command.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.620]   God commands it, and any husband and any wife
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.340]   who says, no, I'm not doing that,
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.920]   says, I reject the word of God,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.900]   and I am choosing to live in rebellion against it.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.260]   It is a command, it is not optional,
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.900]   and it is not feelings-based,
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.980]   and as you go into marriage, you need to make sure
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.580]   you have a lock on that idea,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.860]   and that truth from God's word.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.300]   You got a lot of expectations, you need to go in expecting,
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   there's gonna be days I do not feel like this,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   and I'm gonna have to say, die to self,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.060]   and I'm choosing to put you and your needs in front of me,
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.340]   and I don't want to, and I don't feel like it,
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.620]   and I'm choosing to do that.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.740]   It's like this, all of us came into the room,
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.900]   and there's different expectations
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.940]   that fill kind of your mind and your heart
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.260]   as it relates to what your marriage life
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.140]   is gonna look like someday.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.980]   Here's what different expectations you need to come out,
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.180]   here's an expectation you need to make sure,
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.140]   like, what do I mean by that?
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.860]   Like, truly, I remember being single,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.060]   there's just different things you're thinking,
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.880]   whether it's like, when I'm gonna get married,
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.260]   what this person's gonna look like,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.660]   what a wedding day's gonna look like,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.980]   what kind of a life is gonna look like,
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.820]   so you're gonna go in there,
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.620]   and most of us in the room probably expect,
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.780]   maybe there's some of us that don't,
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.900]   but you're gonna get married someday,
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.820]   so here's your wedding ring, you're gonna get married,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.220]   even the timing, you're like, yeah,
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.100]   probably before 30 for sure,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.500]   but not 'til after 25, 'cause, you know,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.540]   I gotta get some things in order,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.780]   and so your expectation would be,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.980]   hey, someday I'm gonna get married,
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.860]   and of course, of course, right?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.460]   There's gonna be lots of great sex in marriage,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.420]   that's a great expectation,
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.340]   and this is just an expectation
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.220]   that in your marriage box, if you will,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.580]   you've got the expectation of,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.660]   man, we're gonna have great sex,
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.900]   and maybe your expectation is someday,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.940]   you know, we're gonna travel the world,
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.880]   we're gonna go see, what is this, Eiffel Tower, Paris,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.520]   we're gonna see things together,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.340]   and, oh, of course,
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.380]   some point we're gonna have little ones,
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.980]   and here we are just walking in the woods together,
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.220]   we're doing family photos,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.340]   that's an expectation I have,
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.100]   and we're all dressing up here the same,
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.260]   and of course, we're doing matching pajama pictures
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.500]   at Christmas time, and this is your expectation,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.740]   and you've got a million of 'em,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.100]   some said, some unsaid, guys,
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.160]   you're probably going like,
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.640]   I don't even know exactly which ones I have expectations on,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.900]   where's the sex one again?
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.260]   That's pretty much it.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.940]   Whatever they are, but all of us came in the room
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.860]   with expectations,
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.260]   we got a dog in here for some reason?
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.420]   House, we're gonna have this white picket fence together,
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.220]   we're gonna wake up and have our quiet times,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.260]   it's just gonna be incredible,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.980]   it's always gonna be great, coffee, quiet time,
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.740]   yes, please, namaste in bed,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.780]   then we're gonna grow old together,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.820]   and sit on this park bench,
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.120]   somehow I've got another of the pajama things
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.040]   popping in here,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.400]   all of those are great.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.340]   I hope that every expectation that you have,
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.180]   and every hope and dream,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.660]   and whatever those things that you've thought about,
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.700]   and this is gonna be so sweet,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.840]   and I can't wait 'til all of those happen,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.780]   and put 'em in your box,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.260]   put 'em in the marriage expectation box,
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.980]   none of that is wrong.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.340]   I wanna make sure you leave with the expectation
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.580]   that included in my box needs to be
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.740]   the covenant-keeping love,
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.060]   that aha, va, that I'm deciding to stay,
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.900]   even when it's really hard,
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.820]   even when I don't want to,
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.800]   I'm deciding that I'm going to love you,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.060]   and sacrifice, and lay down my life for you.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.900]   Biblically, the Bible says,
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.720]   "Greater love has no man than this,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.540]   "than he lays down his life."
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.540]   And the decision in marriage is a constant
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.260]   on putting the needs of my spouse before myself.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.580]   I'm choosing to be God's provision,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.020]   and to be an extension of God's grace to this person,
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.980]   and to serve them, and to care of them,
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.700]   and I'm not going anywhere, no matter what happens.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.580]   And you need to make sure that in that marriage box,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.700]   you know it's gonna be hard,
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.540]   it's got lots of great things,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.180]   and there's gonna be times where I am not going anywhere,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.660]   and you need to make sure the person you marry,
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.340]   above everything else, has that in there,
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.420]   and that you, above any other expectation,
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.360]   have that in your marriage box.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.100]   In conclusion, marriage is a covenant,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.460]   and love inside of marriage is a choice.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:46.180]   Song of Solomon has been God's design and celebration
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.340]   of just the incredible gift of romance.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:53.120]   But as I wrap up, and I'm landing the plane,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.860]   just having done this week after week,
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.020]   and seen it for the last 10 years,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.220]   there's like this underlying lie
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   that I think a lot of people believe,
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.340]   as it relates to marriage.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.460]   And here's the lie,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:12.400]   that marriage can fix and fill something empty inside of me.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.940]   Like as soon as I get married, then life really begins,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.560]   and then I can really experience satisfaction,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.940]   and that's where life is,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.820]   and until that, I'm just kind of on the waiting room,
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.560]   or I'm just waiting for life to begin.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.960]   And it's a lie.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.320]   As long as you look for someone,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.560]   and that some person on this planet
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.640]   that can fill and fix some emptiness,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.960]   or some void that you find inside of yourself,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.800]   you are looking for a solution that will never work.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.400]   Let me explain it like this.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.740]   My favorite Apple product ever is the AirPods.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.800]   Thank you.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.440]   And I think this is like the greatest invention
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.280]   Apple has ever made.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.840]   Anybody have AirPods in here before?
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.800]   Anybody have AirPods?
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.160]   You guys gotta get AirPods, like for real.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.640]   Tonight, you should leave the application from this message.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.760]   Go materialism.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.480]   So AirPods, here's one of the things that I love about 'em.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.560]   Like you can throw one in, I can take calls.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.240]   It sounds like the phone's up in my ear.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.140]   You know, I can double-click it, and it pauses the thing.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.000]   I can have just one in, I can have both in,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.480]   I can have the right in, I can have either.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.820]   I can embed now, if my wife's going to bed,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.620]   I can be like, hey, I'm gonna throw this in,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.800]   watch some Netflix, or do whatever,
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   and I can have that in my ear.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.280]   And sometimes, if I do that, I'll wake up the next morning,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.520]   and if you've ever slept with an AirPod in your ear,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.840]   it's like on your forehead,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.200]   or you're looking for it somewhere in the bed,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.560]   and you can't find it.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.240]   And inevitably, it's like run out of battery.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.880]   And here's what's interesting about these AirPods,
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   is there's two of 'em.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.640]   They're a pair, a match, if you will.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.900]   You got one, you got its mate.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.280]   And when this thing is low on battery, you know what's crazy?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.560]   And this thing has full battery,
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.340]   I can't get this to fill this thing up.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.120]   It can't, despite the fact that they're really complimentary,
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.840]   I mean, they were made to work together,
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.880]   when they do work together, it's incredible,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.240]   but when one is lacking something, or one is empty,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.520]   despite the fact that this may have something,
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.560]   or have plenty inside of it,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.600]   it cannot fill what is lacking,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.360]   and what is empty in the other one.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.080]   Marriage can fix your singleness,
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.400]   and address your singleness.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.280]   It cannot fill your emptiness.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.140]   And there is something inside of every single human heart,
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.320]   that from the moment that you were born,
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.720]   there has been a vacuum, or a hole inside of your heart,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.560]   and the temptation for most people on the planet
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.200]   is to think, hey, you know what?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.320]   I bet this person could fill what is lacking,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.360]   what is empty inside of me.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.480]   I bet if you come alongside, and they could fill,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.220]   and you have bought a lie,
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.840]   because that hole was placed there by God,
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.520]   so that you would know, and reach out, and find Him,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.360]   that it would lead you, and point you to Him.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.240]   Marriage and love will not satisfy you,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.280]   and if you are empty today,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.720]   you will not experience a fullness,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.920]   or a satisfaction tomorrow.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.400]   You'll have it for about a week, and then it'll be gone.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:10.360]   Solomon, tragically, never,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.660]   or I guess he did learn it, he learned it the hard way.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.120]   What do I mean?
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.420]   The lesson that marriage cannot satisfy you.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.100]   Like love and marriage, it will not satisfy you.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.680]   Getting married today, you don't have to wait
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.720]   to get over your singleness,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.360]   you don't have to wait 'til you're married someday.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.640]   It's not going to fill some hole in your heart.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.680]   And Solomon, his story from here,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.720]   it really is kind of tragic.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.160]   I don't know if you know much of the story
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.800]   of Song of Solomon, it's kind of the irony of the book.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.360]   As he starts off, he's this young king,
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.840]   and they have this amazing marriage.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.280]   They write a love song together.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.940]   It's a manual on sex and romance,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.520]   and you would think if anybody in the world,
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.580]   they got it, they're the couple to look to,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.260]   and of course, they're growing old,
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.520]   sitting on that park bench together somewhere.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.600]   It was not the case.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.880]   Solomon didn't find the love he was looking for
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.460]   in this relationship, and eventually it grew cold.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.540]   And one decision after the next after the next,
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.980]   Solomon was king.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.540]   And we're told in 1 Kings chapter 11,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.220]   that he decided to look for a filling of void
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.420]   and a hole in his heart.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.220]   And one of the ways he did it was after marriage,
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.860]   after marriage, after marriage.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.260]   Here's what it says, 1 Kings chapter 11,
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.100]   verse two through four.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.380]   "There were nations from which the Lord
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.840]   "had told the Israelites,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.980]   "you must not intermarry with them."
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.580]   So God had said, hey, there's some people,
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.540]   I don't want you to intermarry,
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.240]   "because they will turn your hearts after other gods."
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.360]   Hey, you marry foreign women or foreign men,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.860]   you're gonna worship foreign gods, so don't do that.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.000]   "Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.660]   "He had 700 wives,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.540]   "and 300 concubines,"
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.500]   which is just like a live-in girlfriend
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.440]   not officially married to.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.540]   "And his wives led him astray.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.400]   "And as Solomon grew old,
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.820]   "his wives turned his heart after gods,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.480]   "and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God,
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.540]   "as the heart of David his father had been."
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.860]   Think about that.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.500]   Like we read past the verse and it's like 700,
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.580]   oh yeah, that's kinda cool, it's in the Bible,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.540]   I don't get most of the stuff in here.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.460]   Think about that.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.540]   700 times he stood before a woman
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.660]   and said, "Man, she's it.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.660]   "She's the one."
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.220]   You gotta be thinking at some point he's going,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.500]   this is gonna be the love that finally fills,
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.980]   I'm like, this is the girl.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.460]   And we don't know what happened exactly.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.500]   Maybe Shulamith died.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.060]   Maybe she died and their love story was over
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.940]   and out of his heartbreak he just spent one day
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.340]   after the next after looking for some sort of love
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.520]   that could fill that hole
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.940]   that he felt was left behind from her.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.100]   We're not told any of that, we don't know.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.620]   But 700 times he stood in front of another woman
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.300]   and said, "Man, she's it.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.500]   "She's gonna be the one."
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.740]   And it didn't satisfy.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.980]   And he kept chasing and he kept chasing
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   and he kept looking and he kept looking.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.660]   The love that you are looking for
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.380]   is not in some other person.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.940]   And Solomon discovered that after hundreds of times.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.420]   I mean, he was getting married every day
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.580]   for two years straight.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.820]   And he came up empty.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.540]   And it cost him.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.380]   Because of his decision and his heart getting turned,
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.220]   God said, "I'm ripping the kingdom from your son's hand."
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.580]   And Solomon in his old age,
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.420]   we're told that he writes this book called Ecclesiastes.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.220]   Ecclesiastes was what he wrote at the end of his life
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.540]   and he writes and he basically goes like,
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.620]   "Man, I've chased everything.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.200]   "I chased women, I chased the party,
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.560]   "I chased building, I chased success.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   "I got more money than you, I got more ladies than you,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.520]   "I got more cribs than you,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.220]   "I got more than you will ever have."
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.460]   And I'm just telling you, this is the point of the book.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.100]   All of it is meaningless.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.260]   Unless you get beyond the sun.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.300]   That's how he puts it in the book.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.540]   Underneath the sun, all of this stuff is meaningless.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.820]   And he gives the inference like,
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.700]   "Unless you can get beyond the sun,"
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.620]   or what translation?
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.280]   "Outside of this world, you will never find
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.200]   "the love you're looking for,
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.300]   "the satisfaction you are looking for."
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.600]   Friends, some of you came in here tonight
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.740]   and you are so discouraged and so just beat down
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.820]   by the fact that you're not married
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.700]   and you have bought this lie that one day,
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.100]   "If I just got married, I'd be satisfied."
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.660]   And the story of Solomon is that you are looking for a love
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.300]   that you're not gonna find in the arms of another man
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.020]   or the arms of another woman.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.540]   And he did it 700 times and he came up empty.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.180]   Because it is a hole that God placed there.
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.740]   And Solomon wrote that.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.300]   In his old age, he wrote this in Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11,
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.700]   as we finish the plane.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.560]   "God has made everything beautiful in its time."
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.900]   Listen to this.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:46.620]   "He has put eternity into man's heart."
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.500]   What does that mean?
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:56.540]   It means there's a hole in your heart
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.860]   that nothing, unless it is eternal, can fill.
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.180]   Because God put it there.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.940]   And he put it there so that you would have this ache
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.500]   every single day and every time that you go
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.460]   into a relationship and it never satisfies,
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.540]   where you would go, "Man, there's gotta be something else
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.820]   "beyond the sun.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.260]   "There's gotta be something in this life
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.360]   "or something out there that could fill this ache
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.180]   "in this hole that is there."
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.440]   And God said, "I put that there
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.600]   "so you'll constantly look to me."
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.780]   The love that you have been looking for,
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.820]   the love that you were born for.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.100]   And man, I hope you get this so bad beyond anything else.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.340]   And some of you are getting this.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.280]   What you're discovering, and your singleness right now
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.500]   is not the defining characteristic of your life.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   Like you came in here tonight and you're like,
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.340]   "Yeah, I'm single.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.300]   "I don't know if I'm ever gonna get married."
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.940]   But Jesus, you're enough.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.540]   You're all I want.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.460]   You're all I've ever wanted.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.460]   You're all that I need and everything that I want
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.420]   in this life and will you give me more of yourself
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.180]   and help me to trust you and know you and walk with you?
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.580]   And it's like the more that you begin to know
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.740]   and walk with God, the more you experience that.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.480]   And I know you're going, "Oh, it's easy for you to say,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.600]   "you know, because you're married."
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.060]   I can tell you as someone who is married,
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.300]   it doesn't satisfy.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.260]   If you're sitting in the audience and you're going,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.420]   "Yeah, I mean, God would be great
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.260]   "and heaven would be awesome,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.280]   "but you know, I still just wanna get married
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.300]   "and God, please don't come back till I get married."
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.420]   Think about that.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.140]   That's saying, I mean, heaven's great,
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.660]   but I think marriage would probably be better than heaven.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.820]   And as someone who has been married for seven years,
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.420]   it is not, it's amazing.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.700]   It's not the love you were looking for.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.780]   It won't fill the hole in your heart
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.120]   because it wasn't designed to.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.520]   And as long as you think it will,
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.380]   you're gonna put expectations on your mate
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.260]   in that relationship.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.300]   Fill me up.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.100]   Fill me up.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.520]   And it can't unless it is connected to a source of life.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.880]   And in this circumstance with us,
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.500]   the source of life is not some charger,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.340]   it is God, your creator, who loves you,
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.740]   who proved that love by dying in your place.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.640]   That is the love you've been looking for your entire life.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.560]   And it is the love that your entire life,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.100]   you'll either walk with, accept, and experience,
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.660]   or you will continue to look for it
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.160]   because here's what I promise.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.340]   You're not gonna find it in marriage.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.580]   But that love is looking for you if you'll accept it.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.920]   And it's a love that perfectly displayed itself to you
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.120]   2,000 years ago.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.260]   Where the lover of your soul and the one you were made for
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.020]   became a man and died for you and for me,
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.500]   for anyone who trusts in him.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.300]   Let me pray.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.220]   Father, I pray.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:42.260]   God, I pray for every dating couple in this room
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.340]   and listening right now online
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.600]   and listening at different 17 locations
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.500]   that you would protect them from making a decision
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.000]   and marrying someone who is not your will,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.440]   who doesn't love you and doesn't know you,
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.020]   who will not be a wife or a husband or a mom
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.940]   or a father someday, who will honor you and walk with you.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.660]   Would you break them up, God, tonight
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.620]   as they listen and hear my voice at a later time,
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.780]   would you break them up?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.980]   I pray for any engaged couple, would you protect them
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.180]   and would they pursue purity?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.620]   I pray, God, would you raise up a generation of people
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.740]   who know you and walk with you and they marry together
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.020]   for the purpose not of fulfilling each other
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.320]   but fulfilling the mission you put us on the planet for,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.080]   knowing you and making you known.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.660]   Would you raise up inside of this room
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.900]   hundreds and hundreds of marriages
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.500]   and to those listening in other places,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:33.180]   hundreds of marriages who know that the ultimate meaning
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.740]   in life is not from marriage, it comes from you.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.420]   And would you destroy and end relationships
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.040]   and your spirit be heavy on anyone
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.540]   who doesn't need to be in one?
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.220]   I pray for healing, God, for sexual abuse
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.480]   that's taken place, baggage that we carry,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.880]   that you would just work and heal in our hearts.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.140]   I pray for pornography addictions that need to end,
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.540]   that you would kill them, you would expose them.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.980]   I pray that you would make us incredible lovers
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.300]   because we love and know you, make us servants, God.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.900]   Would we decrease and you increase?
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.040]   In Jesus's name, amen.
