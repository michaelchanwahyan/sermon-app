1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 I mean, he's practically dating a model.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
 She told me they went to Cabo and he paid for the whole thing.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,220
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,200
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,400
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,040
 She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,840
 What more could you ask for?

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,320
 What more could you ask for?

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,680
 Hey, isn't worship, great worship, a gift?

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,960
 I know Fort Worth and Houston, you just worshipped as well.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
 It is a gift.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,640
 Can we just applaud our bands, whoever just led us, wherever you're at.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,800
 Thank you for using your gifts to, it's like you're looking, you came in, you're distracted

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,780
 and you're looking through this lens that's out of focus and great worship through song

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,840
 and music just focuses our hearts for what we're about to hear as we move through this

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,560
 series relationship goals.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,200
 And so great to be with you.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,760
 Great to have been with you in Sky Ranch and to return back here with you now.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,000
 And so I want to start with a buying experience I've recently had.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,300
 I went shopping for sunglasses, actually bought two pair of sunglasses for two different reasons

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,660
 and had two very different purchasing experiences.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,280
 Have you guys ever gone and bought sunglasses before or glasses of any sort before?

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,580
 I see lots of them, so I know you have, unless you stole them.

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,220
 I hope you didn't.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,720
 So I go out, so the first kind, the first week, Monica and I were in Mexico and I forgot

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,760
 my sunglasses and I kind of didn't even realize that I forgot my sunglasses.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,720
 We're out there and we went shopping one day in Mexico, like, you know, to a mall in Cancun

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,840
 and we're walking through the mall and I'm like, oh, I forgot my sunglasses.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,640
 I think I should get some.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
 And I didn't really know what I was looking for.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
 And so I put on some aviators and I'm like, Hey, what do you think?

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,100
 She's like, nah, too top gun.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
 And so I put on some wayfares.

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
 I'm like, what do you think?

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,260
 She's like, nah, too Ferris Bueller day off and or last summer.

36
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,160
 And so, and so I kept trying on different pairs, you know, what do you think?

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,720
 How do they, how do these make me feel?

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,040
 You know, who, what is the identity that I'm putting on with these and kind of just different

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
 trying on different kinds.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,160
 I must've tried on like a hundred pair of sunglasses before coming to one and then constantly

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,560
 second guessing that decision.

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,240
 And uh, and so, Oh well.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,400
 And so the second time I purchased a pair in the past couple of weeks was actually for

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,480
 my friend Shane E. So his car got broken into and I was over at his house and his car got

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,280
 broken into that night.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
 And, um, and he's like, man, they stole my sunglasses.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
 I'm like, I'm sorry, bro.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,040
 I was like, Hey, I'd love to get you a new pair, you know?

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,480
 And uh, and so I'm like, what were they?

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
 And he's like, well, they were some Ray bans.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
 I was like, well, what, what were they?

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,320
 And he's like, they were a model number RB 8301 size 56.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,000
 I'm like, these things come in sizes.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
 And uh, and he's like, yeah, size 56.

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
 That's what they were.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
 I'm like, well, I'm glad you know.

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
 Okay.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,240
 So I'm going, so, so we, we, Monica and I are on a double date with some friends and

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
 we find ourselves out.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,440
 And so I go, I'm looking for the sun.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
 I'm like, Hey, I've got to find shady, some sunglasses.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,100
 Do you guys mind if we, if we go, and so I'm walking into sunglass hut and sunglass Island

63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,720
 and sunglass are us and, and trying to find these.

64
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,200
 And, and so now I know exactly what I'm looking for.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 Right.

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,680
 And it's, I'm like, Hey, do you have RB 8301 size 56?

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,000
 And they're like, Oh, come here, sir.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
 You know, here's our selection of Ray-Bans.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
 You know, these I think would look great on you.

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
 You don't understand.

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,040
 I'm looking for RB 8301 size 56.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 Do you have those?

74
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
 Cause if you don't have those, I'm wasting my time.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
 You're wasting my time.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,680
 8301 size 56.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'm sorry, sir.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 We don't have that.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Okay.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Thanks.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Onto the next store.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
 Hey, do you have RB 8301 size 56?

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
 Uh, sir, let me look.

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
 Oh, you know what?

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
 Here's the Ray-Ban section.

86
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
 I think these Maui gems would look good.

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
 No, no, no.

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
 You don't understand.

89
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
 Mr. Salesperson.

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,920
 I'm looking for RB 8301 size 56.

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,820
 They're like size 56.

92
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,400
 They come standard in size 59.

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,040
 I know my friend has a tiny head.

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 Okay.

95
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,600
 I need size 56.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,120
 I'm like, don't let that distract you from worship later, but I'm looking for size 56.

97
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
 And so like, I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
 I don't have those.

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,960
 And so we go one to the next to the next, because here's the deal.

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,560
 These guys are trained professionals.

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,200
 It is their occupation to sell me a pair of sunglasses.

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,840
 But if they don't have what, see the way that I overcome their sales brainwashing is I know

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,640
 exactly what I'm looking for.

104
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,400
 There's, there's two kinds of shopping.

105
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
 You guys know this.

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,240
 You, you have been to the mall where you know exactly what you're looking for.

107
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,400
 We'll call you the focused shopper.

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,460
 You're the focus shopper.

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
 You're going in.

110
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
 You're like me.

111
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
 Hey, do you have this?

112
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
 If you don't, you're wasting my time.

113
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,780
 And then there's the impulsive buyer.

114
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,260
 This is where you have a little bit of money, a little bit of time, and you're looking to

115
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,060
 feel better.

116
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,480
 So you go to the mall and you find yourself looking at purses, you know, because your

117
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,960
 old purse is well, not the one you're looking at.

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,040
 You know, you got no reason, you know, until you, you're looking at buying a bag so you

119
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,400
 can put your 26 other bags inside of it.

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,780
 You're like, well, this Mark Jacob or, you know, Tory Burch or long champ or whatever,

121
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
 you know, I don't know.

122
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
 Let me just try these out.

123
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,900
 Or, or you're just, you find yourself in Brookstone, you know, looking at some weird remote control

124
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,980
 helicopter that works for your iPad only because you have money in time and you're going to

125
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:56,460
 get sold because you don't know what you're looking for.

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,300
 And some of us date that way.

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,980
 We don't know what we're looking for.

128
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,020
 And so we're just waiting for this feeling to come to us.

129
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,020
 And somebody told us, well, you just know when you know.

130
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,440
 And so you're going through life waiting till you just know, when does this feeling kind

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,340
 of come up on me so that I can identify the person that I'm going to spend the rest of

132
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
 my life with?

133
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,000
 And that's foolish.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,920
 Start with standards.

135
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,980
 And so tonight, as we move through relationship goals, we're talking about identifying the

136
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:39,980
 one, whether you are on the date or trying to find the person that you're going to date.

137
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,980
 I want to give you from the scriptures, some criteria so that you can know what you are

138
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,380
 looking for so that you can identify the one.

139
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,860
 And when I say the one, I just want to clear up some misunderstandings.

140
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,220
 Say maybe you came in here and you thought that there is one person out there that you're

141
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,660
 looking for and you've got to find them like a needle in a haystack.

142
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,940
 No.

143
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,540
 If you're a follower of Jesus Christ and you're listening to this message right now, there's

144
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,160
 a group of people that you can select from, probably hundreds of thousands of people that

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,740
 you could spend the rest of your life with and fulfill God's will for you.

146
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,140
 I always hit that home in this way.

147
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,100
 My wife and I have been married for 12 years now.

148
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,180
 And I always say, do you think that I am the best one for her?

149
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,140
 Now I'm six feet, seven inches tall.

150
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,220
 She's five three.

151
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,860
 We're very different beings.

152
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,180
 If God made her specifically for me and me only for her, then he just has a sense of

153
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,020
 humor that he would put us together.

154
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,780
 Is there someone out there better for Monica than me?

155
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
 Absolutely.

156
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
 Problem.

157
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,380
 Some of you, I just heard mind blown.

158
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,820
 Yes, yes, there are men out there better for her, better suited for her, more compatible

159
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,780
 for her than me.

160
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,240
 But we married each other.

161
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,700
 And so we belong to each other for the rest of this life.

162
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,380
 We're not searching for anybody else.

163
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,100
 We don't need to find anyone else.

164
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 Right?

165
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,380
 If you believe in this idea of the one, then when marriage gets tough, you're going to

166
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,260
 think, oh, I married the wrong one.

167
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,360
 That's what about half of you will do.

168
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,220
 That's what I want to save you from tonight.

169
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,220
 One of many things I want to save you from tonight.

170
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,060
 And so if you're a follower of Christ, there's this relatively small group of people that

171
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:50,780
 you can look in to try and find the one out of many that could be the one.

172
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,300
 So tonight we're identifying the one I'm going to be in first Timothy chapter four.

173
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,980
 If you want to turn there, we're going to look at one verse tonight.

174
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,260
 We'll look at several verses, but I'm going to move through slowly through one verse.

175
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,180
 As we talk about five things that scripture identifies that would make a great list.

176
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,920
 Let me give you this disclaimer.

177
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,980
 This is not a dating verse.

178
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
 Okay.

179
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,260
 This is the apostle Paul talking to Timothy saying, Hey, if they try to look down on you,

180
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,100
 set an example in these five character traits.

181
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,220
 But as I think about biblical character traits that I could give you to for a husband or

182
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,420
 a wife, I cannot put together a better list than the apostle Paul or the Holy spirit through

183
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,980
 the apostle Paul already put together here in first Timothy four.

184
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,500
 I have zero problem with you writing down this list and leaving with it and using it

185
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:51,900
 as a checklist in a dating relationship or as you consider one, you got to have standards.

186
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,660
 And let me say this in love.

187
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,020
 If your standards are not God's standards, then your standards are stupid.

188
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,540
 And I mean that as lovingly as I possibly can.

189
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,380
 If you are out there and you're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with

190
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:14,100
 and you haven't considered God's standards for you, what are you doing?

191
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,980
 If your standards are not God's standards, then your standards are stupid.

192
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,420
 First Timothy four 12.

193
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,100
 Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.

194
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,440
 Hey, newsflash.

195
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,940
 If you're in this room or you're listening to this message, most likely you are an adult.

196
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,300
 You can buy cigarettes and vote and everything.

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,980
 And so I don't know when this happened.

198
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,380
 Somehow it just happened to you.

199
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,940
 You woke up one day and he was like, I'm a grownup time to do grownup things.

200
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
 Okay.

201
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,980
 And so he's like, don't let anyone look down on you because you're young, but don't stick

202
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
 out your chest.

203
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,340
 I'm like, yeah, don't look down on me cause I'm young.

204
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:57,980
 He's going to tell you how, here's how you don't set an example for the other believers.

205
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,140
 Paul tells Timothy and he gives us five things in the, in the way you talk and speech and

206
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:12,280
 the way you act in conduct and the way you love in faith and in purity.

207
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,700
 And as I think about what you're looking for in someone that you might spend the rest of

208
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,900
 your life with, I can't come up with a better list than this.

209
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,100
 This is a gift to young adults who want to get married this verse.

210
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,060
 And so the first one, he says, what did they say?

211
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
 This is the question.

212
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,100
 It's going to be five questions.

213
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
 What did they say?

214
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,100
 He says, set it.

215
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,620
 Super negative.

216
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,160
 Are they constantly critical or do they encourage you?

217
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,860
 What comes out of their mouth, both to you and to others?

218
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,000
 You don't have to be dating to observe this as you hang out and you run in circles.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,960
 You can listen to what people say.

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,540
 What did they say?

221
00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:01,520
 Did they show their ignorance and lack of vocabulary by constantly using profanity?

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,940
 Are they quick to get angry?

223
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,860
 Are they harsh?

224
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,600
 James one 19 says, be quick to listen and slow to speak and slow to become angry for

225
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
 man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.

226
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,300
 Did they have the righteous life that God desires for them or are they quick temper?

227
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,220
 That's not going to make a good husband.

228
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,580
 Oh, he just has a bad temper.

229
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
 Cool.

230
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,900
 He's a bad husband.

231
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
 Okay.

232
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 That's not cool.

233
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,000
 I was at a restaurant once and this woman was there wearing this shirt and it said,

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,800
 you call me a B like it's a bad thing, but said the word, you know, and I'm sitting there

235
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,160
 thinking, man, I think it's a bad thing.

236
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,060
 And I wanted to go tell her, but I was scared of her.

237
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,740
 Cause I'm like, man, maybe, you know, anybody who wears that shirt, you know, right.

238
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,620
 Who's who knows what's going to happen.

239
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
 Right.

240
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,420
 But it's not cool to be feisty or sassy or have attitude.

241
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,580
 Like if you found identity in that, you found identity in something different than the spirit

242
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,420
 of God.

243
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
 Why would you do that?

244
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,420
 That's not who you are.

245
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,540
 Cause it's not who Christ is.

246
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,820
 Just be careful if you're like, oh man, don't mess with me.

247
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,740
 Nobody will.

248
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,380
 Nobody.

249
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,380
 Why does this matter?

250
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
 It feels like tips and tricks.

251
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,900
 I think this is first on the list.

252
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,480
 And I think it's unbelievably important because Jesus says, because as you're thinking about

253
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,580
 spending the rest of your life with someone, you want to know what's in their heart.

254
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:52,420
 And let's be honest, you can't just kind of walk up and, you know, somehow look inside

255
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,320
 their heart.

256
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,780
 You can't see what's in their soul, but Jesus says you actually can.

257
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,220
 He says, pay close attention to what comes out of their mouth.

258
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,500
 This is the number one way to tell what's in somebody's heart.

259
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,140
 He says this in Luke chapter six, verse 45, a good man brings good things out of the good

260
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,220
 stored up in his heart.

261
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,980
 And an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for the mouth

262
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,320
 speaks what the heart is full of.

263
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,860
 You want to know what some, what is in someone's heart.

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,160
 You look carefully, listen carefully to what comes out of their mouth.

265
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,660
 Are they a gossip?

266
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,980
 Are they constantly talking about people instead of two people?

267
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,140
 Are they a, did you hear person?

268
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
 You know this?

269
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
 Did you, did you hear about self?

270
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
 Oh, did you hear?

271
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
 She, did you hear?

272
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
 Hey, did you hear this?

273
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
 Did you hear that?

274
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:48,380
 Oh man, did you hear, are they a, did you hear person?

275
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,340
 Or can I tell you what I told them person?

276
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,660
 Cause I don't talk about people.

277
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,020
 I talk to people what's coming out of their mouth.

278
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:06,740
 Man, can I just tell you like sometimes ministry is hard.

279
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,740
 You're listening to people's problems and, and you're talking to people all the time

280
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,660
 and like sometimes it's really difficult.

281
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,820
 And sometimes I just whiff, like sometimes I just miss it.

282
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,980
 Sometimes I get angry.

283
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,300
 Sometimes I'm impatient, man.

284
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,100
 Sometimes I didn't have time to like work on a message and I feel like I phoned it in

285
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,740
 and I get down and say, Oh, I'm just kind of beat myself up.

286
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,780
 I can tell you what a blessing it is to go home to a cheerleader.

287
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,460
 I married a cheerleader y'all.

288
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,820
 And she comes aside and she doesn't, she's never like, Oh babe, what do you want?

289
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,980
 You need more time to prepare.

290
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,300
 Hey, you shouldn't have said this.

291
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 Hey, you gotta be patient.

292
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,340
 She's like, Oh sweetie, come here.

293
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
 Talk to me about it.

294
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,740
 Hey, let me remind you who you are to God.

295
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,140
 Can I remind you how he loves you?

296
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,740
 Can I remind you what he sees in you?

297
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,500
 Man, that is a blessing y'all.

298
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,940
 Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader because the Proverbs tell us it's better to

299
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,300
 be on the corner of a roof than with the contentious wife.

300
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,860
 Better to be, it's like a dripping faucet.

301
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,820
 It says it's like it's Chinese water torture to be with a contentious wife.

302
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,420
 Like you don't want the woman who's who wears the shirt.

303
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,120
 You call me a B like it's a bad thing.

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,780
 You don't want that.

305
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,840
 You don't want the guy who misses the free throw and throws the basketball out the window.

306
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,980
 You don't want that along with curse words and whatnot.

307
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,420
 I always ask my kids, do you speak, are you speaking words that build up?

308
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,260
 You want someone who speaks words that build up, that encourage, that help everybody who

309
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,500
 hear them.

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,980
 Man, that is a blessing to the rest of your life y'all.

311
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,420
 And so the second thing is what are they known for?

312
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,740
 The second question on the list, what are they known for?

313
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,620
 It says they set an example in conduct.

314
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,780
 The word is the way they act or your, your version may actually say in their life, what

315
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
 is their reputation?

316
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
 What are they known for?

317
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,500
 Proverbs chapter 20 verse 11 says, even small children are known by their actions.

318
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,660
 So is their conduct really pure and upright?

319
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,460
 We should inspect it even from when they're little, they are known, they have a reputation

320
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,380
 by what they do.

321
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,960
 And so this is really the essence of dating, right?

322
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,820
 We're trying to figure out, are they someone we want to marry?

323
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,540
 And so really, as we spend time with them, we're looking at the way they act.

324
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,380
 And in fact, really the rest of this list fits under this conduct banner.

325
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
 How did they act?

326
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,780
 He's going to give us some other things to inspect, but really it fits under this.

327
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,420
 Hey, how did they act as you choose from this very relatively small group of people?

328
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,060
 And if they love Jesus, you can clearly see this in their life.

329
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,200
 And so if you're hanging around with people and you're like, man, I don't know anybody

330
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,540
 who loves Jesus like that.

331
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,060
 Can I just tell you you're hanging in the wrong circles?

332
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,660
 Paul actually says in Philippians two, that these kinds of people stand out like stars

333
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:14,460
 in a dark night, that you can't miss them because in contrast to culture, in contrast

334
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,220
 to our world, they shine brightly.

335
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,900
 And if you're like, man, I don't know anyone like that.

336
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,540
 And you may be hanging out in the wrong places.

337
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,180
 And so we date to observe and we're not trying to find out if we're compatible.

338
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,620
 Can I just give you this newsflash?

339
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,520
 Like a female center and a male center are incompatible centers.

340
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 They're not compatible.

341
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 Okay.

342
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,620
 Here's what I mean by that.

343
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,460
 You're going to conflict.

344
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,820
 You're going to argue.

345
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,260
 You're not going to get along.

346
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,260
 And so really you're, you're relying on that commitment, that covenant that you made to

347
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,500
 work through that.

348
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,340
 You're not trying to find someone compatible with you.

349
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,860
 You're trying to find someone fully yielded to Christ in the way that they live their

350
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
 life.

351
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,980
 And if you're fully yielded to Christ and they're fully yielded to Christ, you don't

352
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,100
 have to pursue each other.

353
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,060
 You're pursuing God together and therefore growing closer and closer and closer and closer

354
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
 every day.

355
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,580
 This concept changed my marriage and my dating relationship.

356
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,860
 In fact, it pushed me to marriage because I realized, Hey, I was dating someone at the

357
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,940
 time who was fully yielded to Christ.

358
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,380
 I said, well, what am I doing then?

359
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,260
 I'm wasting my time dating her.

360
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,380
 Put a ring on it.

361
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,960
 And so let me tell you that last week, you know, we talked about baggage and for those

362
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,580
 of you who are here, who, who have never married, I would tell you, there is nothing that you've

363
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,780
 done that has disqualified you from marriage.

364
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
 Nothing.

365
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,860
 Okay.

366
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,940
 And so if you left last week feeling condemned or guilty or like this isn't for you, no,

367
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,780
 there's nothing that you've done that has disqualified you from marriage, but be faithful

368
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:10,260
 and heal from that baggage and you can pursue marriage, but consider their reputation and

369
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,980
 listen to people, right?

370
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,260
 Listen to people.

371
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,780
 There was a guy who was, uh, this guy and this girl, they were going to get married.

372
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,340
 We found out kind of last minute that he had a track record of being abusive and they hadn't

373
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,620
 known each other very long, like only a couple of months.

374
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,860
 And so, you know, before the wedding we said, Hey, we, we wouldn't do this.

375
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,140
 You guys should stop and, and date a little bit longer and, and let's see a track record

376
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
 of faithfulness.

377
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,700
 And she said, no, he's, he's really charming.

378
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,620
 You know, he's, he's been really kind to me and, and she was really upset with us for

379
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
 saying this.

380
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,940
 And so they got married and they went on the honeymoon and they came off the honeymoon

381
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,420
 and he threw her down a flight of stairs and broke both of her legs.

382
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:10,620
 And we were there, you know, pick up the pieces, but consider someone's reputation, their track

383
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,860
 record, where they've been.

384
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,460
 She said, he's really charming.

385
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,780
 You know, Proverbs says 31 verse 30, charm is deceptive.

386
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,100
 And not only is charming is charm deceptive, but beauty is fleeting.

387
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,580
 And then you're looking for a woman who fears the Lord.

388
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,460
 What you want is you want their repentance to be as notorious as their rebellion.

389
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
 Do you understand?

390
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,540
 Like, I'm not saying if they were rebellious, that they're disqualified from marriage.

391
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,740
 I'm saying that they're qualified from, for marriage whenever their repentance is as notorious

392
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,060
 as their rebellion was.

393
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,940
 And so I don't care if he's been to prison.

394
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
 Okay.

395
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,060
 Single parents make amazing spouses, but you want their repentance to be as notorious as

396
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
 their rebellion.

397
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,380
 And when you see that track record, you're like, Hey, let's go.

398
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,820
 I don't care what they've done.

399
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,300
 Christ can heal and fix anything, but that doesn't mean you need to be in a rush or just

400
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,580
 trust their words.

401
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,900
 And so not only is charming charm, deceptive, but beauty is fleeting guys.

402
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,320
 Can't just say something, man.

403
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,420
 Some of your criteria is dumb.

404
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,820
 All right.

405
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,460
 Like you're walking around, you're talking to your boys.

406
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,700
 You're like, man, I'm a boob guy.

407
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,060
 I'm a butt guy.

408
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,780
 You're a dumb guy.

409
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,340
 You need to be a Bible guy.

410
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,340
 All right.

411
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,340
 Jesus Duke.

412
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
 Okay.

413
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,500
 You need to be a Bible guy.

414
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,420
 You need to have criteria that God has.

415
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
 All right.

416
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 Listen, listen.

417
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,340
 If you're listening to this message, never ever say that again for the rest of your life.

418
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
 Okay.

419
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,340
 It's stupid.

420
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,900
 All right.

421
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,620
 It's dumb.

422
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,220
 You do not love the things that God loves.

423
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,400
 You love the things that pornography have taught you to love.

424
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,620
 You need to repent and ask the Lord to change your heart and your mind so that you might

425
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,820
 be attracted to what he's attracted to when he says, I look at the heart.

426
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,780
 Okay.

427
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,580
 And so adjust your criteria to meet his criteria because it says that beauty is fleeting.

428
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,820
 Here's all that means.

429
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,300
 It's going away.

430
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,660
 It's a depreciating asset.

431
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
 Nobody here, right?

432
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,380
 If I said, Hey man, how many of you just think like some 80 year old woman's really hot.

433
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,900
 Don't raise your hand if that's you.

434
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,260
 Okay.

435
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,980
 Probably you're like, not as just, not just my thing, but by the grace of God, maybe one

436
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,080
 day you might be married to an 80 year old.

437
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,460
 And I still think you're going to be attracted to that 23 year old co-ed.

438
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,660
 Okay.

439
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,020
 But if you've learned commitment and to love the things that God loves, hopefully her heart

440
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,420
 is still attractive to you.

441
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,980
 And let's face it, we're all getting uglier every day.

442
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,060
 Okay.

443
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
 That's what's happening.

444
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
 You're going to leave here.

445
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
 You're going to hate me.

446
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,060
 Think about it.

447
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,300
 It's the truth.

448
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,600
 Okay.

449
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,560
 But your heart can get more and more beautiful.

450
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,780
 And I pray the Lord brings somebody that would see that and notice that and realize that.

451
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,820
 And so beauty is fleeting.

452
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 And here's what that, we just got to talk about this for a minute.

453
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,020
 And so as you inspect what they do, we got to inspect how they dress.

454
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,940
 Let's talk about modesty for a moment.

455
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,900
 Are they trying to attract you with their character or with their abs, who they are

456
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,020
 or their curves, right?

457
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,780
 It matters.

458
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,640
 And so this is where I think social media is just a real gift to us.

459
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,240
 Because if she's like taking the picture, you know, cleavage, you know, perfect angle

460
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,660
 and everything, or she's laying on the bed and it looks like she wants to sleep with

461
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
 you.

462
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,940
 She probably wants to sleep with you.

463
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
 And I would run.

464
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,300
 I would unfriend her and I would run the other direction and say, I do not want anything

465
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,420
 to do with that.

466
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,860
 That's not who I'm looking to spend the rest of my life with.

467
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,340
 And she's trying to waste my time.

468
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,120
 And that goes for him too.

469
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,140
 And so ladies, you will not catch a good guy with your body.

470
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,540
 You will catch a guy that loves your body and he will leave you when your body leaves.

471
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,180
 And ladies, your body's going to leave.

472
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,580
 Okay.

473
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,860
 You get nine months pregnant, your body's gone, you know, and it may come back.

474
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,140
 Hey, Hey, stay with me.

475
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,620
 It may come back.

476
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,180
 It may come back and then you're going to do it again and it may come back and you're

477
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
 gonna do it again.

478
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,380
 But listen, when you're 80 years old, your body's gone.

479
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,060
 That's all I'm saying.

480
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
 You got it.

481
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,740
 You come up here like, no, I'm gonna get Botox and plastic surgery.

482
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
 And I'm going to do, no, come on.

483
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,500
 You're going to be on botched or something.

484
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 Nip and tuck.

485
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,180
 That's what I'm talking about right now.

486
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,420
 First Peter three versus three through five says your beauty should not come from outward

487
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
 adornment.

488
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,420
 What, what, what does that mean?

489
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,020
 Why would God preserve that for thousands of years?

490
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
 What are we talking about?

491
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,940
 If we're not talking about outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing

492
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,700
 wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes, rather it should be that of your inner self, the

493
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,140
 unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.

494
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,100
 What if we started applying that verse to our lives?

495
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,380
 Game changer.

496
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,460
 And so ladies, do you address attractively?

497
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
 It's fine.

498
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,300
 It's fine to put some effort in the way you look.

499
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,140
 Or do you dress to attract like you're bait?

500
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,540
 You're not bait ladies.

501
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
 You're not bait.

502
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
 You're a person.

503
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,620
 You don't have to address to attract.

504
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,620
 You can dress attractively, but you don't need to address to attract.

505
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
 You're not bait.

506
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:57,100
 You're not trying to catch a fish.

507
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,420
 So people are known by what they do.

508
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,980
 It's called a reputation.

509
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,380
 I said when their repentance is notorious as their rebellion, that's when they've changed.

510
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,220
 I mean, let me hit it home like this.

511
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,860
 If, if I want to get a loan from the bank, like, let's just say I need $10,000 from the

512
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,540
 bank.

513
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,740
 And so to get this loan, let's say I rent a car and say I've rent a Bentley, $400,000

514
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
 Bentley.

515
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,980
 Let's say I put on a $3,000 Brioni suit.

516
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,180
 I walk in there with a leather binder.

517
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,140
 I've got my act together.

518
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,780
 I'm saying all the right things.

519
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,380
 I sit down with that banker and I say, Hey, I need $10,000.

520
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,700
 Now is he going to listen to what I say and look at what I'm wearing and look at what

521
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,060
 I drove up in and be like, Oh man, that's easy.

522
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
 You must be a millionaire.

523
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,500
 Here's 10 grand.

524
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,540
 What's he going to do?

525
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,100
 What's he going to do?

526
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,420
 He's going to check my credit because it's going to tell the real story.

527
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,780
 He's going to look at my history because it doesn't lie.

528
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
 The car can lie.

529
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,860
 The suit can lie.

530
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,820
 My words can lie.

531
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,300
 Everything about me can lie, but the history doesn't lie.

532
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,340
 I've heard it said that past behavior is the best indicator of future performance.

533
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,180
 Past behavior is the best indicator of future performance.

534
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,340
 And so am I saying you're disqualified from marriage?

535
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,980
 No, but I'm saying you need a season of faithfulness.

536
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,140
 Third point, how do they love?

537
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,500
 You asked the question, how do they love?

538
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,760
 He says, do they set an example in how they love?

539
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,300
 How have they treated others?

540
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 They've dated.

541
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,260
 You could interview their exes if that was even possible, but they probably be like,

542
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,540
 "Oh man, she's a psycho."

543
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,340
 Well, why did you date a psycho?

544
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
 Can I ask you that question?

545
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,140
 "Oh, but no, no, no, you don't know.

546
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,140
 It was her problem."

547
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,420
 Okay, sure it was.

548
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,660
 One seems right to another pleases case.

549
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,980
 And so how do they love?

550
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,020
 How have they loved others?

551
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 Because here's the deal.

552
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,100
 When we left, we just got back from this deal called launch retreat at Sky Ranch.

553
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,060
 And whenever we left to Sky Ranch, the last thing that I said is I said, "Hey, we want

554
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,940
 to leave this place better than we found it."

555
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,460
 That's hard to do.

556
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,940
 It's hard to leave a place better than you found it.

557
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,140
 We want to pick up the trash.

558
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,380
 We want to leave the cabins cleaner than we found them.

559
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,620
 We want to have a great reputation with this incredible partner.

560
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,620
 And that's how you date.

561
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,720
 You leave somebody better than you found them.

562
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,900
 That's how followers of Christ date with this new culturally idea that has only been around.

563
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,560
 Dating as we know and understand it has only been around less than 100 years.

564
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,620
 It started as a euphemism for prostitution.

565
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
 True story.

566
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
 Look it up later.

567
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,700
 That's the history of dating.

568
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,300
 So dating is not even necessary for marriage, but it is the way that our culture does it

569
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,860
 today.

570
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,740
 And so as you date someone, as a follower of Jesus Christ, can you imagine that when

571
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,820
 you break up, they're like, "Man, I'm so glad we spent time together.

572
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
 You encouraged me with your words.

573
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,060
 You were kind to me.

574
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,340
 You were a picture of what it looks like when a man treats a woman with respect or a woman

575
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,020
 treats a man with respect and love.

576
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,480
 It was incredible.

577
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
 Thank you for the time.

578
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,140
 I'm sorry that it didn't work out, but I'm really glad we got to know each other when

579
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
 we did.

580
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
 And my heart didn't dry.

581
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
 I didn't give it to you.

582
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
 That's mine.

583
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,380
 That hardly exists today, but you leave here and you try that, and I'm telling you, it's

584
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,100
 going to save you so much time and heartache.

585
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,580
 You leave someone better than you found them.

586
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,820
 Did they leave others they've dated better than they found them?

587
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,700
 Or are they driving down the road, looking at the rear view mirror of dating, and there's

588
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,820
 just cars piled up?

589
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,540
 Wrecks, baggage, hurts, heartache.

590
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,740
 How do they date?

591
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,220
 How do they date?

592
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
 How do they love?

593
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,360
 You asked me, why do you love them?

594
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,100
 Sometimes people say, because the way they make me feel.

595
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,040
 Will you just listen to that?

596
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,380
 How selfish is that?

597
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,980
 I love them because of the way they make me feel.

598
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,140
 What about when you don't feel that anymore?

599
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,300
 Do we love God because of the way he makes us feel?

600
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,420
 No, we love God because of who he is, because sometimes the feelings aren't there.

601
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,080
 Sometimes you don't want to get in the Bible.

602
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,580
 Sometimes you don't want to seek him.

603
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,140
 You do not love God because of the way he makes you feel.

604
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,100
 You love him because of who he is.

605
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,420
 The way that he's loved us, he invented it.

606
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,220
 You don't love somebody because of the way they make you feel.

607
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,420
 You love them out of a commitment.

608
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,980
 The emotion, as Adam said a few weeks ago, it plays a tiny part in it, but it is not

609
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
 ultimate.

610
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:43,780
 As you're considering someone, have they followed their feelings in and out of a relationship?

611
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,220
 That's what happens when you follow your feelings.

612
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,260
 You follow your feelings in and out of jobs, in and out of relationships.

613
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,940
 A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings define their reality.

614
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
 Let me say that again.

615
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,860
 A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings define their reality.

616
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,080
 A sign of maturity is when the truth defines reality, regardless of how they feel.

617
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,620
 But a sign of a lack of maturity is when their feelings define what is real for them, because

618
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,700
 our feelings change.

619
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,740
 That's why you have to look past the feelings of love to the action, the verb of love.

620
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,260
 How does she care for people?

621
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,460
 Is she compassionate?

622
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,000
 Where does she serve?

623
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,140
 How does he treat people who can do nothing for him?

624
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,500
 Not you when he's dating you and trying to trick you into marrying him.

625
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,000
 How does he treat people who can do nothing for him in return?

626
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,060
 The homeless man on the side of the road, the server in the restaurant, the person who

627
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,180
 just cut him off in traffic.

628
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,160
 At what point does he feel entitled toward anger?

629
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,820
 Because that's when he's going to feel entitled toward anger to you.

630
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,140
 Is he controlled by the spirit or controlled by his emotions?

631
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,340
 If he doesn't treat you well, it's done.

632
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,420
 Listen, I'm tired, and I mean this as lovingly as I can.

633
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,660
 My motive, I got no other motive than for you to have a happy marriage.

634
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,860
 If he's cheated on you, it's done.

635
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,020
 Well, where's the grace in that, JP?

636
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,760
 Man, extend grace, right?

637
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,900
 When there's something, you know, small, overlook a small offense.

638
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,480
 If he's identified himself in a dating relationship as unfaithful.

639
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,240
 If she's cheated on you, you don't need to continue that relationship.

640
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,860
 They're not walking with Christ.

641
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,660
 They did something with someone else they shouldn't even do with you.

642
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,340
 And so stop tricking yourself into our modern idea of dating and say, I'm going to go find

643
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,820
 someone fully yielded to Jesus.

644
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,240
 You said, well, where's the grace in that?

645
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,660
 It may be the most graceful thing you could possibly do is to show them that, hey, that

646
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,180
 will not be tolerated by the church.

647
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,940
 Okay.

648
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,340
 Extend grace in marriage possibly once there's a covenant commitment there, but not in dating

649
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,860
 in regards to that specific infringement.

650
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,660
 So ladies, is he considered of your feelings?

651
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,860
 Is he just running game?

652
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,960
 Does he initiate or does he leave you wondering constantly?

653
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
 Is he intentional?

654
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,580
 Men, does she thrive on drama or she's steady in difficult situations?

655
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,160
 I'm not saying that your relationship history DQs you from marriage.

656
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,620
 I'm saying you want to track record.

657
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,780
 You want to season of faithfulness, walking with God.

658
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,020
 This that there's never been a divorce between two people who are committed to walking with

659
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
 Christ.

660
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,100
 It's never happened in the history of history.

661
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:53,100
 Divorce rate about 50% marriage satisfaction rate, much lower 20% but between two people

662
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,340
 fully committed to Christ, there's never been a divorce between those two people ever.

663
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
 It's never happened.

664
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,660
 And so I'm not saying your history DQs you the other day we bought a car for Monica.

665
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,940
 I kind of told you before some of that process, but we found one and inexpensive one that

666
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,900
 we can afford, I should say.

667
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,660
 And I ran before we purchased it, I ran Carfax and it had been in a wreck.

668
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,700
 This car was discounted accordingly.

669
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,380
 And for some that would be like, Hey, I'm not going to touch it.

670
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
 It's been in an accident.

671
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,100
 But what I looked at it as that Carfax is it had been in a wreck three and a half years

672
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
 ago.

673
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,980
 It was repaired and it hadn't had any problems since then.

674
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,580
 You see that the wreck doesn't DQ you, but the season of faithfulness is what qualifies

675
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:42,580
 you a season of walking in relationship, committed to Christ.

676
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,260
 The fourth thing is what do they believe?

677
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,100
 He says, do they set an example in faith?

678
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
 What do they believe?

679
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,940
 This is a big one of really important one.

680
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,240
 This is not a check the box.

681
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
 They go to church.

682
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,460
 I met him at the porch, right?

683
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,420
 There are people here who are going to use this list to pray on you.

684
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
 That's the reality.

685
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,580
 There are people here pretending and posing.

686
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,860
 There are wolves among the sheep.

687
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,080
 We will find you.

688
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,900
 We will expose you.

689
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
 That's the truth.

690
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
 Okay.

691
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
 We're looking for you.

692
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,020
 But for those of you that are here that are looking for this list, you want to consider,

693
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,420
 Hey, what is their faith?

694
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
 Not like this.

695
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
 Okay.

696
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,880
 Yeah, I'm not, I'm, I'm a Christian.

697
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,120
 That's their words, but is the trajectory of their life that they're committed.

698
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,180
 They're connected to a church.

699
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,300
 The members they're serving, they're in community.

700
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,460
 They wake up, they get into God's word.

701
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,460
 It's it marks them.

702
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
 This is important.

703
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,680
 Second Corinthians six 14 says, do not be an equally yoked with non believers.

704
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,540
 What do righteousness and wickedness have in common or what fellowship can light have

705
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
 with darkness?

706
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,820
 I've said this before.

707
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,060
 People have gotten so angry at me.

708
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,660
 This is like basic, basic stuff.

709
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,840
 If you're a follower of Christ, you don't date someone not following Christ period.

710
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 That would be detrimental.

711
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,100
 If Christ is the most important thing to you in your life and they don't believe in him,

712
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,680
 then what are you doing?

713
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,180
 You're wasting their time there.

714
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,620
 You're wasting your time.

715
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,900
 And so you're looking for someone who has already committed to Christ.

716
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,540
 If you never get married, you'll be okay.

717
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,020
 If you never have sex, you will be okay, man.

718
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,980
 And if you've had all kinds of sex and you have all kinds of, of history or you've done

719
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,760
 everything wrong, I want you to know there is hope for you in the gospel.

720
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,080
 It is never too late to take your life and to say, Christ, I'm ready to go all in with

721
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
 you.

722
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,480
 I'm going to connect to your body, the church.

723
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,400
 I'm going to, I'm going to surround myself with other people running hard after you.

724
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
 I'm going to begin to learn and know your word.

725
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
 It's never too late.

726
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,040
 I don't care if you're 80 and your body's failed you.

727
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,280
 It's still, you can still jump in with Jesus.

728
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:02,760
 It's never, ever, ever too late.

729
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,280
 They should be in community, study the word, belong to a church running with Christians.

730
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,140
 This is why where you look really matters.

731
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,760
 Just real quick.

732
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,260
 Okay.

733
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,760
 Like it's, you want to look where that relatively small group of people that you can marry is

734
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,460
 all the time.

735
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,880
 Like I can find a Christian book at Barnes and Nobles.

736
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,380
 Like I can walk into that book, big bookstore and I can try to like navigate, okay, where

737
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,480
 is the Christian, the faith section and in the faith section, I want to go to the Christian

738
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,200
 section and then in that Christian section, there's going to be some Christian books there.

739
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,380
 I can search for it there, but it's a lot easier to find a Christian book in a Christian

740
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,380
 bookstore, right?

741
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,060
 If I go to Lagos or Lifeway, like the odds are if you blindfold me and I grab a book

742
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,820
 off the shelf in Barnes and Nobles, it's probably not Christian.

743
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,900
 You blindfold me and I grab a book off the shelf at Lifeway.

744
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
 It probably is.

745
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,400
 I'm not saying there's not crazy there.

746
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
 There's heretics there.

747
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,700
 There's people that have written books that call themselves Christians with whack theology.

748
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,740
 That's certainly there, but more than likely you grab a book off the shelf in a Christian

749
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,860
 bookstore and it's going to be a Christian book.

750
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
 The same is true.

751
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,900
 Like you, can you find someone to spend the rest of your life with in the bar or the club?

752
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,420
 I guess it's possible.

753
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,940
 Like if you want to stack the odds against God and see, I guess you can do that, right?

754
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,940
 Why would you do that?

755
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,980
 Why not just go to where the people you can marry go and hang out there and grab one off

756
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,980
 the shelf?

757
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,380
 Likewise, you could find a Christian.

758
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,300
 I'm not saying that all of them here are Christian.

759
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,700
 There's crazy here too, I promise.

760
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,620
 Fifth one, last one.

761
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,700
 It's a big one too, though.

762
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,360
 They're all big, honestly.

763
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 They're all important.

764
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,820
 That's why they're on the list.

765
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,580
 Are they relentless about purity?

766
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,060
 This is the only yes or no question on here.

767
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,020
 It's a yes or no question.

768
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,060
 Are they relentless about purity?

769
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,340
 He says, "Set an example in your purity."

770
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,700
 The word is translated chastity.

771
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,780
 It's this, the state or practice of refraining from extramarital or especially from all sexual

772
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,260
 intercourse.

773
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,500
 Set an example in your purity.

774
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,060
 I want to tell you why it really matters.

775
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:35,900
 Because remember, they're supposed to be fully committed to Christ.

776
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:46,700
 If they'll push the envelope with you or with pornography or with someone else or by themselves,

777
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,500
 they're saying something.

778
00:40:49,500 --> 00:41:01,660
 They're saying, "Hey, I'm committed to having sex, pursuing intercourse outside of marriage.

779
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,780
 I'm telling you that right now.

780
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,740
 Like my feelings, my desires, I put them before God's word.

781
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,340
 I do what I want to do when I want to do it.

782
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,420
 If this is the boundary of marriage, I'm telling you right now as we're dating, as I push this,

783
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,620
 as I try to talk you into this thing with me, I'm telling you something.

784
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,240
 I'm telling you the marital institution or God's institution of marriage is not ultimate

785
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
 to me.

786
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
 It is not important to me.

787
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,660
 If it was, I would marry you and then bring up the conversation.

788
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,580
 But instead I'm bringing it up out here because I don't think it can happen outside of the

789
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,580
 confines of marriage."

790
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,820
 They're saying something.

791
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,340
 They're saying this, "I'm an adulterer.

792
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
 I live this, man.

793
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:53,040
 And here's what I mean by that is I had sex outside of marriage, was addicted to pornography.

794
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,060
 I got inside of marriage and I thought, oh, this is going to be awesome because I have

795
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,700
 someone I can have sex with whenever I want.

796
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,380
 It's not really how it works.

797
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,140
 Okay, that's just loving counsel to you.

798
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,780
 I know you may think that like, man, you just must get home and have sex three or four or

799
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,020
 five or six times.

800
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,940
 I told you last week, you know, my friend says, I hope you never have sex, but that

801
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:18,780
 with your spouse, you pursue intimacy, that we redefine that word.

802
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,260
 And so as someone who had jumped in and out of relationships, as soon as they got hard,

803
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,900
 I had trained myself for divorce my entire life.

804
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,700
 And so two years in a marriage, I'm like, man, this is hard.

805
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,740
 I want out.

806
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,420
 I want to go outside of my marriage.

807
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,420
 That's all I know.

808
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,620
 I was addicted to it.

809
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,020
 And by the grace of God, I didn't, aside from pornography, which I did.

810
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,860
 And God has restored me and he's healed my marriage.

811
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,740
 But I'm saying this to you.

812
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,140
 So that's not your strategy, is hope.

813
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,340
 But that right now you would pursue healing.

814
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,740
 Right now you would pursue that track record of faithfulness because I've married people,

815
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
 guys.

816
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,100
 And, and like, like some of them, like they waited till the altar to kiss.

817
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,180
 They never kissed until they were sound was right there.

818
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,260
 I'm doing the wedding.

819
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
 Their friends are there.

820
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
 The friends are watching the first kiss.

821
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,940
 And I know that some of you right now are like, that is crazy.

822
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,100
 Okay.

823
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,580
 I want you to, here's, here's the truth.

824
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,460
 It's not like they didn't want to.

825
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:28,300
 It's not like they weren't extremely tempted to constantly, but you imagine with me for

826
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,940
 a moment how protected that marriage is now, how crafty is the enemy that he says, man,

827
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,700
 you want to make sure you do that on this side of marriage.

828
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,700
 I've never, ever, ever talked to the married couple who said, man, I wish we'd went further

829
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,220
 when we were dating.

830
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,580
 We should have tried more stuff out, you know, make sure everything's fits.

831
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,700
 It's crazy.

832
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,220
 I've never met that couple.

833
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,540
 And you're laughing, but I know you've said it crazy stuff like that.

834
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,740
 And it's ridiculous.

835
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,860
 That's why it's funny right now because it's ridiculous.

836
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,180
 And can I tell you something about the couple?

837
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,380
 I'm not even saying I'm not prescribing that as the law for you.

838
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,340
 I'm saying for those of you that just said, why'd they wait until they were married to

839
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,900
 kiss my hunches.

840
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,420
 I'm going to go on a limb.

841
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,140
 They have a better marriage than you will.

842
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,300
 This is my hunch.

843
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,980
 I mean, I married a lot of people, dozens and dozens of people.

844
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,020
 My hunch is their marriage is better than yours.

845
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,780
 Follow them as they follow Christ.

846
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,380
 First Corinthians 6, 18 verse 20, flee from sexual immorality, run from it.

847
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,580
 All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against

848
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,780
 his own body.

849
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,220
 Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy spirit who is in you whom you've

850
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,660
 received from God?

851
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,060
 You are not your own.

852
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,220
 You were bought by a price.

853
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,020
 Therefore honor God with your body.

854
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,180
 And so if you're asking how far is too far, you, you've already gone too far in your mind.

855
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,840
 It says flee from sexual immorality.

856
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,940
 How far is too far?

857
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,140
 Run the other way.

858
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
 Go the other.

859
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,420
 How, what can, can we hold hands?

860
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,220
 I don't know if you hold hands at the altar, you probably be glad you did, but if you don't

861
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,580
 find what, I don't know, right?

862
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,180
 I'm not, I'm not here to put law on you.

863
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,500
 I'm saying pursue absolute purity.

864
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,220
 I wish I would have.

865
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,220
 Some people are like, no regrets.

866
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,220
 I'm like, that's ridiculous.

867
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
 I've got tons.

868
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,200
 I've got lots of regrets, man.

869
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,700
 Everything that I did that was not God's will.

870
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,500
 I regret everything I did that went against God's commands.

871
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,100
 I regret, did you hear what it said?

872
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,260
 It says you are not your own.

873
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,180
 I'm going to go a little bit long tonight.

874
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,140
 I'm just going to tell you, cause there's a lot here, but we're almost done.

875
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,780
 It says you are not your own.

876
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,180
 It says you've been bought at a price.

877
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,500
 You ever have somebody borrow something from you?

878
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,580
 iPhone charger, truck.

879
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
 You got a truck.

880
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,580
 I'll borrow your truck.

881
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,580
 You ever had this?

882
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,580
 You're like in your roommate's closet.

883
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,140
 You're like, how did my shoes get in here, girl?

884
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,220
 You didn't even ask, you know, where'd you wear these?

885
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,100
 You ever have somebody borrow something from you?

886
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,860
 I know this is like total dad illustration, but we had a bounce house and, um, people

887
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,220
 would want to borrow it all the time.

888
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,180
 And so they would call, Hey, can we borrow your bounce house, man?

889
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,220
 We have this like birthday party for, you know, second graders.

890
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,700
 Can we borrow your bounce house?

891
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,700
 Sure, man.

892
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,700
 Yeah, absolutely.

893
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,260
 You know, you can borrow the bounce house.

894
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,860
 But when they would, I would say, Hey, here, here's the rules to the bounce house.

895
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,540
 You know, no more than five people in it.

896
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,540
 It's a small bounce house.

897
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,580
 No more than five people in it.

898
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
 No adults.

899
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,900
 It's not like commercial grades, you know?

900
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,660
 And uh, and, and you know, here's, uh, here's where I'd love to have it back.

901
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,900
 Why am I giving them rules?

902
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,260
 Why would I expect that they follow the rules of my bounce house?

903
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,700
 Because it's my bounce house.

904
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,320
 That's why you are not your own.

905
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,700
 You are not your own.

906
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,860
 You were bought by a price.

907
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,580
 That's why I can tell you how to treat your body because it belongs to me.

908
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,860
 You have it on loan.

909
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,700
 And so while you borrow that body from God, I would lean in heavily and say, Hey God,

910
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,100
 what do you want me to do with it?

911
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,740
 And what don't you want me to do with it?

912
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,040
 Okay.

913
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,380
 Because he loves you.

914
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,500
 I'm not making rules for the bounce house just for fun.

915
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,500
 It eventually popped in the possession of somebody else.

916
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,020
 I'm still a little angry about it anyways, right?

917
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:30,840
 He's telling you this because he loves you and he cares about you and he wants good things

918
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,900
 for you.

919
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,140
 And it's never too late to follow his commands.

920
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,540
 In summary, inspect what do they say?

921
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,340
 What are they known for?

922
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,820
 What do they love?

923
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,300
 What do they believe?

924
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:53,780
 And how are they relentless about purity?

925
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,780
 Are they relentless about purity?

926
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:07,700
 I have a friend, Ryan, he was, came to the porch and just kind of really learned a lot

927
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,260
 of these things, just kind of God's desires for dating.

928
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,740
 And he took note of this girl that was very different than his criteria.

929
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,380
 Like he thought, you know, I'd marry a blonde and she'd be this short or this tall or whatever.

930
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,800
 And she was just different than all the things like his worldly list.

931
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,140
 But he realized that she met the godly criteria.

932
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,740
 And so before he left for an international discipleship trip or a mission trip, he said

933
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,340
 to her, Hey, I'd like to ask you out when I get back.

934
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,340
 And he goes on the trip.

935
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,140
 Now she's thinking, well, I mean, this guy is nothing that I thought that I would be

936
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,140
 married to.

937
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,940
 And so I'm not, you know, he's just not what I'm looking for in a guy.

938
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,380
 But as she began to pray about it, she committed to praying about it while he was gone.

939
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
 She went through this list.

940
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,860
 She says, you know what?

941
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,580
 All of his words build people up.

942
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,620
 And he has a great reputation among his friends in his community.

943
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,960
 And it seems like he loves well, like he's caring and compassionate and gentle and good

944
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
 to others.

945
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,380
 He has a good reputation there.

946
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,900
 I know that he's committed to purity.

947
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,180
 I know that the guys that he's running with are committed to helping him be committed

948
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,180
 to purity.

949
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,860
 And I know he loves Jesus.

950
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,140
 Why wouldn't I give this a shot?

951
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
 When he got back, she said, yeah, I'll give it a shot.

952
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
 We can go on a date.

953
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,500
 They've been married now for a couple of years.

954
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,620
 I got to do their wedding.

955
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,580
 And so listen, okay.

956
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,940
 And they have an incredible ministry together.

957
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
 That's that's the punchline.

958
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,820
 I mean, God has strengthened their ministry together because this life is about him.

959
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,820
 Right?

960
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,700
 Marriage is this metaphor of Christ in the church.

961
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,700
 I don't know if you know this.

962
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,700
 I don't have time to teach you now.

963
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,700
 We're out of time.

964
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,420
 But marriage, God gave it to us.

965
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,860
 It's a metaphor of how he loves us and how he's committed to us.

966
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,340
 What criteria did he give you?

967
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,620
 Did he want you curvy, blonde, brunette, dark skin, light skin before you come to him before

968
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,620
 you can spend forever with him?

969
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,660
 What criteria did he have?

970
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:10,780
 Once your heart, once your heart, he's so much more concerned with what you believe

971
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,260
 than what you look like.

972
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,200
 You see that you should be too.

973
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,200
 You know what happened?

974
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,740
 I found those sunglasses eventually.

975
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,860
 RB 8301, believe it or not, size 56.

976
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,860
 You know what I did?

977
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,220
 I bought them.

978
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,500
 I committed to them.

979
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,340
 They met the standard.

980
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,780
 They were what I'm looking for.

981
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,700
 You're not looking for a person.

982
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,460
 You're looking for character traits that would make a great spouse.

983
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,660
 Begin to look for those character traits.

984
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,660
 Redefine your standards.

985
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,820
 Redefine your list.

986
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,900
 Consider Christ's list towards you.

987
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,420
 I'm going to pray and we're going to move towards worship.

988
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,180
 I'd love for you just to think through this list.

989
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,180
 I hope you wrote it down.

990
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,500
 If you can't, you can go back and listen to it.

991
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:10,940
 Father, thank you that there's nothing that we've done or a way that we look or a way

992
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,860
 that we dress that disqualifies us from you.

993
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,620
 But that in the gospel, you're rushing toward us.

994
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,980
 You're jealous for us.

995
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,580
 You love us through amazing grace.

996
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,060
 You care about us.

997
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,860
 Father, thank you for this list of traits that you scribe through your servant Paul

998
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,380
 to Timothy.

999
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:39,420
 I pray that you would help that be a fruitful list for my friends here this evening as they

1000
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,640
 consider who they might spend the rest of their life with.

1001
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,140
 Would you use it in their hearts and their lives and their minds and in their communities?

1002
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,380
 Father, we thank you that we can laugh together and that we can study your word together and

1003
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,280
 just that it gives life, that it never returns void.

1004
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,160
 Most of all, Lord, we're thankful for how you love us.

1005
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,160
 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

1006
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:14,520
 In 1 Samuel 16, God sends Samuel to look for a king to rule his people.

1007
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,640
 Samuel sees Eliab and thinks, "Hey, perfect.

1008
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
 This guy looks like a king."

1009
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,520
 God says, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him."

1010
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,920
 The Lord does not look at the things people look at.

1011
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,560
 People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.

1012
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:39,800
 And so if they don't have these five character traits, they're not right for you in this

1013
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
 season.

1014
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,040
 You don't need to wonder.

1015
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,800
 You don't need to try on a bunch of different things or ask, "Hey, how do they make me feel?"

1016
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
 It's just not right.

1017
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,720
 It doesn't fit in this season.

1018
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,000
 And if they do meet those character traits, you're like, "Man, they got them."

1019
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,240
 There's people running through your mind.

1020
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,520
 They're like, "Well, I know a lot of people that fit those character traits."

1021
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,280
 I mean, we just got back from like 1,000 people in Sky Ranch, and like 200 or 300 of them

1022
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,600
 would fit, I'm guessing, would fit those character traits really well.

1023
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:14,280
 And if you say, "Yeah, but I'm just not attracted to them," then what I would encourage you

1024
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:21,840
 to do is look inward and then say, "God, what is it in me that causes me not to be attracted

1025
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,200
 to the things that you're attracted to?"

1026
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,600
 And so what maturing do I need to do?

1027
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,680
 What time do I need to spend with you that this person whom you've said would make an

1028
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:40,280
 incredible life partner, but I'm just not attracted to them in the things that are fleeting?

1029
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,920
 And so that's just good heart surgery.

1030
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
 I'm not saying it's your fault.

1031
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,080
 I'm not even saying it's your problem.

1032
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,800
 I'm just saying it's something to think through and to pray through.

1033
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,160
 There's nothing that I want more.

1034
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,140
 I mean, I would love to shut this ministry down just because everybody in it just gets

1035
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,800
 married and happily ever after.

1036
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
 Like, that would be awesome.

1037
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,200
 We do the wedding here, like 3,000 or 4,000 of you just get married, it'd be awesome,

1038
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,080
 you know, right?

1039
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,120
 But some of you, before we get there, right, you need a season of faithfulness.

1040
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
 Let us help you with that.

1041
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
 It's time to go all in with Jesus.

1042
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,120
 He loves you.

1043
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
 He's crazy about you.

1044
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,740
 He gave his life for you, for all your sins, for everything you've done wrong.

1045
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,240
 And so tonight, if you're looking for community, you realize you don't have believers around

1046
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
 you.

1047
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,040
 Guys, you go down this hallway, and there's a room full of people there that are also

1048
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
 looking for community.

1049
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,080
 Girls, you go down this hallway, not Snapchat, but down this hallway, and there's a room

1050
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,800
 full of people there that are looking for community.

1051
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,660
 And outside, as you go outside, you're gonna see all these booths, and these are ministry

1052
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,680
 partners of ours.

1053
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:47,320
 These are people who have effective ministry, are doing effective ministry in the city.

1054
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,800
 And you can just stop by those booths and ask them questions and serve with them.

1055
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,440
 They're looking for people to help them further the mission, and you may be a great candidate.

1056
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,880
 And so talk to them.

1057
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,640
 And then if you're here and you're in college, we have a party for you upstairs.

1058
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,540
 And so go to the second floor and look for my friends in the college ministry.

1059
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,540
 They would love to meet you tonight.

1060
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:08,680
 And go up to my friend Adam Tarnow or Paige or Rachel or Daniel and just introduce yourself,

1061
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,680
 okay?

1062
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,600
 And for the rest of you, if we can pray for you or talk to you about anything, you have

1063
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,560
 questions about something I said, you disagreed with it or you really agreed with it or whatever

1064
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,240
 that is, we'd love to talk with you.

1065
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,760
 Find somebody with a light bulb on their shirt.

1066
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,720
 They would love to minister to you and pray with you.

1067
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,720
 Love you guys.
