 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:28,520
 All right, Ports of Dallas, how we doing?

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,800
 My name is Adam Tarnow.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,560
 Excited to be with you guys.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,840
 I want to welcome everybody at all the other Porsche Live

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
 locations and everybody watching online.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,840
 I'm excited to be here with you guys.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,920
 I think I'll just start off with a quick question.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
 Anybody ever had one of those moments in life

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,640
 where you just wanted to crawl and hide and not show

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,040
 your face for a long period of time?

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,840
 Well, since we've already connected so well,

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,260
 I figured I'd go ahead and open up

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,000
 with one of my most embarrassing and shameful moments

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,560
 in my life.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,480
 And so just to set up a little bit of context,

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,800
 about 11 years ago, my wife and I were married.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,960
 And we didn't have any kids.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,760
 We were living in a cool part of Dallas.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,240
 This is back when we were cool.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,600
 And so we were living down in the M Streets area.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,080
 And so those of you that aren't in Dallas,

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,560
 you don't know that.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,040
 But everybody in this room knows that's

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,880
 where all the cool people are.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,920
 And so we were down there living in the M Streets.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
 We didn't have any kids.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,340
 And so we did what a lot of young married couples will do,

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,160
 is we got a pet.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,480
 But we made a bad mistake, and we didn't get the dog.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,400
 We got a cat.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,400
 All right?

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,860
 And I know I just offended most of you.

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,680
 But just wait.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
 It gets worse, OK?

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,300
 And so anyway, we got this cat.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,440
 And for a lot of reasons, we needed

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,880
 to let this cat be an outdoor cat.

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
 And so usually the way things would go

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,480
 is we'd get home from running errands or whatever,

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,200
 and the cat would be waiting on the porch

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
 to go inside and do whatever cats do.

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
 And this one Saturday afternoon--

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,440
 I remember it was in November--

45
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,360
 one Saturday afternoon, we come back after being gone all day,

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,420
 and the cat is not on the porch.

47
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,440
 And I also had kind of an unhealthy relationship

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,480
 with this cat, meaning that I really liked it.

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,040
 And so I had a little bit of anxiety when we drove in.

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,880
 And I looked around, and I couldn't find the cat anywhere,

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,520
 and just thought, that's strange.

52
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,280
 And went inside, and we dropped off whatever groceries

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,820
 or whatever it was that we had.

54
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,480
 And so I decided I'm going to go outside and try to find the cat.

55
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,840
 And I'm walking around, and I can't find the cat anywhere.

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,640
 I come inside.

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,600
 I'm like, Jackie, have you seen the cat?

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,520
 No, I haven't seen it.

59
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
 I go back outside.

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
 And I'm in the backyard, and then I just

61
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,440
 hear this faint little cry.

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,520
 And I'm starting to look around, and my heart's

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,060
 starting to beat a little bit faster.

64
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,480
 And I'm like, OK, where is he?

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,200
 Where is he?

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,960
 And I hear the cry, and I hear the cry.

67
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,960
 And I look in my neighbor's yard up about 25 feet,

68
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,440
 and I realize, oh, good Lord, my cat's 25 feet up in that tree.

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,360
 And I don't know what to do, but I just kind of start to panic.

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,880
 And so I'm like, oh, I'm going to get you, buddy.

71
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,000
 And so I go running inside, and I'm like, Jackie,

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
 Pedro is in the tree.

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,200
 Pedro was his name.

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,400
 And I'm like, Pedro's in the tree right now.

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,520
 And she's just like, so?

76
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
 And I'm like, well, he's over there, and it's November.

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
 It's supposed to get cold tonight.

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
 It's starting to get dark outside.

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
 What are we going to do to get him out of the tree?

80
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,640
 And it's like, she just looks at me, and she goes,

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,760
 have you ever seen a dead cat in a tree?

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
 And I was like, no.

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,100
 And she's like, that's because they always come down, OK?

84
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,040
 They don't stay up there and just die.

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,400
 And I'm like, but that's what-- you heartless woman.

86
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
 That's our baby.

87
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,560
 And so I really kind of start to panic,

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
 and I'm trying to figure out, what am I going to do to get

89
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,480
 this cat down?

90
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,600
 I start looking around the apartment,

91
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,360
 and I just gather anything I think I can throw up there.

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,200
 And I kid you not, I go out there with tennis balls

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
 and rolls of paper towel, OK?

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,600
 And I go up there, and I'm like, chucking these tennis balls up

95
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,480
 at him, and I nail him in the side.

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
 And he does not move an inch.

97
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
 Like, he just digs down in more.

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,640
 And the paper towels was just useless.

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
 I don't know why I brought those out there.

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,200
 I tried throwing them up there.

101
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,720
 They went about 10 feet in the air and then came back down.

102
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
 And so anyway, I go inside, and it's

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
 starting to get a little bit darker.

104
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
 And I'm really starting to panic a little bit,

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,640
 and I'm starting to wonder, what are we going to do to get

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
 this cat out of the tree?

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
 I can't let him stay out here all night.

108
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,920
 And then just an idea popped into my mind

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,520
 is, sometimes I see on, like, Good Morning America

110
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,320
 that if you call the fire department,

111
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,040
 they'll come get your cat out of the tree.

112
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
 Well, I'm not going to call 911.

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,520
 So I just Google "fire department in Dallas."

114
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
 And I find a phone number, and I call it.

115
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
 It's like some office line.

116
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,840
 And I don't know why on a Saturday,

117
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,440
 this young lady answers the phone.

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,560
 And I just say, hey, my cat is stuck in a tree.

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,440
 Do you guys actually do that, or is that just

120
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
 on TV in small towns where the fire department has

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
 nothing else going on?

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
 Is that like something you do?

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,980
 And she said, oh, yeah, we'll do that.

124
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,860
 And I said, OK, well, how can I schedule that?

125
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,160
 Because I got a cat in a tree right now.

126
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,480
 And she says, well, you need to call 911 and just tell them.

127
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,200
 And I was like, this feels like a violation, but OK.

128
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,640
 And so I hang up, call 911, and it's like, Dallas Fire,

129
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
 what's your emergency?

130
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
 And I'm like, no emergency.

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
 Just want to let you know, my name's Adam.

132
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,480
 Hope you're doing well.

133
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,440
 I called this other number, and they told me to call you

134
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
 because I got a cat stuck in the tree.

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
 And I heard that if the fire guys aren't doing anything,

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
 they'll come get my cat out of the tree.

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
 And they said, sure, we'll do that.

138
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,680
 Where do you live?

139
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,600
 Gave them the address.

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,840
 Come.

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
 And I'm like, problem solved.

142
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
 Walk into the kitchen.

143
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,400
 I'm all proud.

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,960
 Jackie, I called the fire department.

145
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
 They're coming.

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,680
 And she's like, I'm having nothing to do with this, OK?

147
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,360
 This is all you.

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
 I'm staying inside.

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
 So I go outside, and I'm anxiously

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
 waiting for the fire department to show up.

151
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
 And then literally, like seven minutes later,

152
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,000
 this truck comes rolling down.

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,320
 And then it stops right in front of my house.

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,320
 And then it turns the lights on.

155
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's dark outside now, or it's like right at dusk.

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,720
 My entire neighborhood is now lit up in lights.

157
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,280
 And that was the first moment when

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,160
 I started to realize, oh, no, I should not have done this,

159
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,640
 OK?

160
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,960
 Because now the neighbors are starting

161
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
 to look out the window, and people

162
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
 are starting to come out on their porch.

163
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,400
 And they're like, who had a heart attack?

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,040
 What's going on?

165
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,800
 And I'm just sitting there going, no, it's just me, my cat.

166
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,960
 And so then three of the manliest men

167
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
 I have ever seen in my life--

168
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,920
 you guys know those firemen calendars?

169
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,680
 I promise you, it was May, June, and July on this fire truck

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
 that get down.

171
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,840
 And it's in that moment I am just like,

172
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,960
 what is going on in my life right now?

173
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,760
 In the recovery world, we call that rock bottom.

174
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,360
 I had hit rock bottom right there.

175
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,800
 And I just realized, I'm like, yeah, my cat's over here.

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
 And so I walk him to the backyard.

177
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,360
 And Mr. May brings the ladder up.

178
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
 And then June climbs up it.

179
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,840
 And I start to try to man up a little bit in that.

180
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,080
 And I just think, oh, I'm going to say something cool.

181
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,520
 And I'm like, if you've got a gun, you can shoot him down.

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,280
 [LAUGHTER]

183
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,440
 And they looked at me like, you are an idiot, OK?

184
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
 And so they grabbed my cat.

185
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
 They grabbed Pedro.

186
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
 And they hand him to me.

187
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,360
 And I take him inside.

188
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,760
 And I look at my wife.

189
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,160
 And I'm like, it's all done.

190
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,920
 I got him.

191
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,720
 And she was just like, I can't believe you did that.

192
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,220
 And I just said, I know I've kind of lost the will to live,

193
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,840
 I think, now.

194
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,040
 And as the time went by, just a few minutes go by,

195
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,680
 and now they're leaving.

196
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,840
 I was overwhelmed with just this feeling of humiliation

197
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
 and embarrassment.

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,840
 It was pretty-- it was prevalent.

199
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,000
 It was very real.

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
 And so I start with that tonight,

201
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,280
 because that's what we're going to talk about as we're going on

202
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,240
 in this series called Mood, is we're

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,520
 taking a biblical look at different human emotions.

204
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,980
 And so the human emotion that we're

205
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,960
 going to talk about tonight is shame, shame and embarrassment.

206
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
 And when I say shame, here's what I mean.

207
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
 Shame is that feeling that we have,

208
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,400
 this deep feeling of humiliation we have after certain choices

209
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,560
 that we make.

210
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,880
 Shame is this thing in our life where

211
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 we feel this desire to hide or conceal

212
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,240
 different parts of our life.

213
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,400
 That's what shame is.

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,760
 And so shame is prevalent in every single one of our lives.

215
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,240
 And that's why I think tonight's message is so important,

216
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,280
 because what I know is probably true about every single person

217
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,080
 in this room tonight is this, is that you struggle with shame.

218
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
 It is a universal emotion.

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
 Every single one of us feels shame at certain points

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,600
 throughout the day or we have at certain points in our life.

221
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,800
 It is like a disease that has infected humanity.

222
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,960
 All of us have felt it.

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
 Some of us are in here tonight, and this is exactly

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,680
 what we're feeling.

225
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,440
 We're feeling this humiliation for certain choices

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,840
 that we've made, and we have this deep desire

227
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,040
 to try to conceal or hide certain aspects of our life.

228
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,480
 But what makes shame so interesting and so dangerous

229
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,400
 is unlike other moods or other emotions

230
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,800
 that you and I experience, shame is absolutely intolerable.

231
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,920
 If you think about it, the other moods or emotions

232
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,960
 that we go through, you can feel them for a long period of time.

233
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,160
 You can feel joy for a long period of time.

234
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
 You can feel happy for a long period of time.

235
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,440
 You can feel content for a long period of time.

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,560
 You can feel mad or angry for a long period of time.

237
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,840
 You can feel depressed or sad or hopeless

238
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
 for a long period of time.

239
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,200
 But shame, this feeling of humiliation,

240
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,880
 this feeling that I want to hide or conceal,

241
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,320
 is unlike any of those other emotions.

242
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,240
 Shame is intolerable in our life,

243
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,520
 and it always, always, always leads us to action.

244
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,600
 And oftentimes, as we're going to see tonight,

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,720
 that action, what we choose to do, where we choose to run,

246
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,640
 it doesn't help at all.

247
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,360
 Shame is a big deal for every single one of us,

248
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,760
 and you have got to learn how to deal with shame,

249
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,920
 because if you don't learn how to deal with it,

250
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,360
 it will take you out.

251
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
 It will completely take you out.

252
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,460
 In the extreme examples, it will lead to suicide.

253
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,060
 You will just become so humiliated with your life

254
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,220
 and so down about your life, and you will lose all hope

255
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,800
 that anything in the future could ever be better.

256
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,320
 And so in an extreme example, if shame,

257
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
 if you don't learn how to deal with it,

258
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,060
 it will lead to you just ending your life.

259
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,160
 It'll end in suicide.

260
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,080
 But more commonly, where it probably ends for a lot of us

261
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,640
 is this, is just this gnawing, nagging, deep-seated

262
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,640
 insecurity and low-level depression that just hangs with us.

263
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,920
 And it just seems to be this thing,

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,360
 this mood that we cannot shake.

265
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,640
 Shame impacts every single one of us,

266
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
 and if we don't learn how to deal with it,

267
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,800
 it is going to take us out.

268
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,960
 And so what we're gonna do tonight

269
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,000
 is we're gonna open up God's Word,

270
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,760
 and we're gonna be in this little story in Luke 8,

271
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,480
 in the gospel of Luke, and it's actually kind of a story

272
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,400
 within a story, and so here's a little bit of the context.

273
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,100
 Jesus has been doing some public ministry.

274
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
 There are a lot of crowds around Him,

275
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,400
 and He is walking through this town,

276
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,980
 and this family comes up to Him,

277
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,440
 and they tell Him about their daughter who is sick,

278
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,340
 this family member who is so sick

279
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,700
 that she's on the verge of dying.

280
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,640
 And so Jesus, full of compassion,

281
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
 wants to go and help this family

282
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,080
 and try to heal this young woman, to heal this young girl.

283
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,440
 Well, as Jesus and the crowds are moving towards this house,

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
 a woman comes and interrupts Jesus.

285
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
 And it's in these few verses in this interruption

286
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
 as Jesus is on His way to go heal this young girl

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
 where we're gonna see a story

288
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,360
 that really parallels our life a lot when it comes to shame.

289
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,540
 And so that's what we're gonna look at today.

290
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,120
 So if you got your Bibles, let's open up to Luke 8.

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,520
 We're gonna be in verses 42 through 48.

292
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,480
 And so here we go.

293
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,720
 Luke 8, verses 42.

294
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,540
 "As Jesus was on His way, the crowds almost crushed Him.

295
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,740
 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding

296
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,720
 for 12 years."

297
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,480
 For 12 years, this is what I love about God's Word,

298
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,700
 is that it doesn't hide anything.

299
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,800
 It talks about real adult human things.

300
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,680
 And so this poor woman was subject to vaginal hemorrhaging

301
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,720
 for over 12 years, for 12 years.

302
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,400
 So Jesus is on His way and this woman who had been bleeding

303
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,120
 for 12 years comes up to Him and this is what happens.

304
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
 So she had been subject to bleeding for 12 years,

305
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,580
 but no one could heal her.

306
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,560
 This was a plague that she had been carrying around,

307
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,880
 this thorn in her side that she had been carrying around.

308
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,800
 In verse 44, "She came up behind Jesus

309
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
 and touched the edge of His cloak.

310
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,440
 And immediately her bleeding stopped."

311
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,600
 Then verse 45, "Who touched me?"

312
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
 Jesus asked.

313
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,280
 Let's just pause here for a second.

314
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
 So you can kind of get this scene.

315
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,880
 There's these crowds, they're crushing Jesus

316
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,160
 and He's moving on and they wanna see this drama

317
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,400
 that's gonna happen as He goes

318
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,100
 and is gonna heal this young girl.

319
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,800
 And there in the midst of all of that,

320
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,220
 this woman sneaks up behind Him,

321
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,980
 touches the edge of His cloak and then just disappears.

322
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,360
 And Jesus is kind of looking around going, "Who touched me?"

323
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,640
 And you can think about this woman

324
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
 and why it was that would cause her,

325
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
 what it was in her life that would cause her

326
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,760
 to want to sneak up behind Jesus.

327
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,360
 And it's pretty clear and it's easy to understand

328
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
 why she would do that because the thing

329
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,560
 that had been ailing her or the ailment that she had

330
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,240
 was incredibly embarrassing.

331
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,580
 I mean, for 12 years to have that bleeding,

332
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,680
 and you can just imagine all the different layers

333
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,820
 that were there adding to the complications

334
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,760
 that culturally, because she was having this bleeding

335
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
 that would not stop for 12 years,

336
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,840
 culturally, she was an outcast.

337
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,600
 She was an outcast and she was considered unclean.

338
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,960
 She was this recluse, she was isolated

339
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,880
 because of this problem that was going on with her own body.

340
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
 And so because she was an outcast culturally,

341
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,080
 that means spiritually, she could not worship God.

342
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
 She was an outcast spiritually.

343
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,480
 And then you just think about the embarrassment physically

344
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,880
 and how uncomfortable that must have been physically

345
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 in the first century when we don't have

346
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,520
 the modern medicine that we have today

347
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,920
 or even the hygiene products that we have today.

348
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,900
 This was a woman who was dealing with a significant issue

349
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,680
 and she was feeling this inadequacy in her life.

350
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
 She was feeling this inadequacy.

351
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,140
 It was something that was embarrassing,

352
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,860
 something that she wanted to conceal or hide,

353
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,680
 something that was probably humiliating her.

354
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,020
 But mixed with that inadequacy,

355
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,000
 there was also probably some pride.

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,080
 There was probably some pride in all of that.

357
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 And where we grab that out of the text is this,

358
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,520
 is that she was one of the only people

359
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,960
 that we see recorded in the gospels

360
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,080
 that wanted healing from Jesus

361
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,560
 that snuck up behind him to get that healing.

362
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,260
 If you read through the rest of the gospels,

363
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,120
 what you'll see is that when somebody was physically,

364
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,880
 had something going on and they came to Jesus

365
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,780
 and wanted healing, they were very public about it.

366
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,760
 I mean, they would come up and be like,

367
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,340
 "Jesus, see, I'm blind," or "I'm lame right now,"

368
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,580
 or they would be laying out in a spot in public

369
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,000
 where all of those who had the physical ailments were.

370
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
 And so Jesus would show up

371
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
 and it was very, very public for so many people.

372
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,840
 This is probably, or what I seem to think,

373
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,080
 is the only recording of somebody who needed healing

374
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,480
 that snuck up behind Jesus

375
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,200
 and did not wanna make it public.

376
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,280
 So she had this inadequacy in her life,

377
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,880
 this failure in her life,

378
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,360
 this thing that was embarrassing to her,

379
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
 but she also had her reputation.

380
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,200
 She had some pride that she didn't want everybody to know.

381
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,960
 And so she snuck up behind him to try to touch his cloak.

382
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,200
 And the first point or observation

383
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,360
 I wanna make out of the passage

384
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,840
 and where our lives kind of parallel

385
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,120
 the life of this woman is this,

386
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,320
 is that really is the formula for shame.

387
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,060
 The formula for shame, if there is one, is this,

388
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,200
 it's our inadequacy and our pride.

389
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,880
 When we understand that we're inadequate,

390
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,120
 but we also have some pride, we have some reputation,

391
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,880
 we're not okay with that inadequacy,

392
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
 when those two things are together,

393
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,220
 that's when we start to feel humiliated.

394
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,920
 That's when we start to wanna conceal or hide.

395
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,160
 And so let me illustrate it this way,

396
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,780
 because I think what a lot of us do

397
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,960
 when we look at our own lives

398
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,240
 is we end up kind of bifurcating our lives.

399
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,200
 We split our lives into two.

400
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
 We wouldn't really admit that we do this,

401
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,040
 but really this is what happens,

402
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,180
 is that we think that there's two,

403
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,440
 you think there's two of you and I think there's two of me.

404
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,600
 There's the ideal you and then there's the bad you.

405
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,520
 And the ideal you is the you that really follows this.

406
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,880
 Let's just fill in the blank.

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,000
 I should fill in the blank.

408
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,920
 You've got your answers, I've got my answers,

409
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,400
 but the way you answer that and the way I answer that,

410
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,880
 that's what determines the ideal you.

411
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,320
 So I should always be in control of my emotions.

412
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 I should always wanna feel like spending time with Jesus.

413
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,900
 I should always share the gospel every chance that I get.

414
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,040
 I should not feel anxious.

415
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,100
 I should be married right now.

416
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,400
 I should be in a better job right now.

417
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,000
 I should be in a better financial position right now.

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,840
 Whatever it is, when you have all of those things lined up,

419
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 you are setting these expectations on your own life,

420
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,000
 saying you should do something.

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
 And when you do it,

422
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,320
 achieve those little goals that you set out.

423
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
 When you do, behave in the way that you think you should.

424
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,880
 That's the ideal you.

425
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,560
 That's the you you like 'cause you're behaving.

426
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,060
 That's the you you think everybody else likes

427
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,960
 because you're performing.

428
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,520
 That's the you you think God really loves,

429
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,380
 the you that is easy for God to love.

430
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,060
 So we have this ideal

431
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,680
 that every single one of us wants to achieve.

432
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,580
 But we also know based on our experience

433
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,020
 that that's not always happens.

434
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,520
 We don't always meet up with our own expectations.

435
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
 And so we have some failure,

436
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,880
 some inadequacy that comes into our life.

437
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,960
 We cannot keep up with our own standards

438
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,400
 that we set in our own life.

439
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
 And so inevitably,

440
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
 even though you want to always stay in control

441
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,280
 of your emotions,

442
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
 even though you want to never feel anxiety,

443
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
 even though you never wanna get angry again,

444
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,360
 the fact of the matter is this, you do get angry.

445
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,300
 You do feel anxious.

446
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
 You are ashamed of your family.

447
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,640
 You are ashamed of your past.

448
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,180
 You do not do everything that you wish you would do.

449
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,540
 So there is inadequacy.

450
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,980
 And when there's inadequacy,

451
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,300
 then we think we are the bad version of us.

452
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,800
 And this bad version of us down here, this is toxic.

453
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,340
 We don't like it.

454
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,020
 We don't think other people like it.

455
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
 We don't think God likes it.

456
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,780
 And so we wallow.

457
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,620
 And there's two us.

458
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,060
 We wish we could be some way, we're inadequate.

459
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,160
 And so we come down here and there is the bad us.

460
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,740
 When we're down here in this toxic part of our life,

461
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,800
 this is where shame pops in.

462
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,280
 This is where we start to feel humiliated.

463
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,000
 This is where we want to conceal or to hide everything.

464
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,960
 I remember the day in my life specifically,

465
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,120
 I remember the night when shame

466
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,960
 became very, very real for me.

467
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,660
 It was probably in my early 20s.

468
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,720
 I was living in Atlanta at the time and I was an accountant.

469
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,680
 I was an auditor and I had a client in Huntsville, Alabama.

470
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,240
 I'd gone to this client completely on my own.

471
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
 My firm had sent me out there on my own

472
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
 and showed up on a Sunday night.

473
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
 And I was there all the way through Thursday night.

474
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,000
 I was going to be driving back home on a Friday after work.

475
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,460
 And I remember it was really a pretty great week

476
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,020
 until it got to Thursday night.

477
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,600
 It was a great week because I was by myself

478
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,620
 and being a natural introvert,

479
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,900
 I liked having time to be by myself in the hotel and read.

480
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,120
 And I was reading a great book

481
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
 and I felt like I was growing

482
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,560
 in my relationship with God that week.

483
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
 I was reading a book about character

484
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
 and how you can grow to be a person of character.

485
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
 And I remember Thursday night,

486
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,400
 I read a chapter that said,

487
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,920
 "Sometimes in order to go forward, you have to go back."

488
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,760
 And I remember reading that sentence

489
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
 and hearing that author talk about,

490
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,200
 "Hey, you've got things in your life that you've done.

491
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,600
 You've got things that you've done to other people.

492
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,660
 You've got certain actions

493
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,940
 that you need to confess and own up to.

494
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,680
 And this part of you sometimes to be able to progress

495
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,640
 and to become a person of character,

496
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,020
 you've got to go back and deal with all of that

497
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,240
 before you can move forward in maturity and character."

498
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,580
 And I'll never forget how hopeless I felt that night.

499
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,800
 Because my story is this,

500
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
 my story is when I was three years old,

501
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
 I was first exposed to pornography.

502
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,800
 And so from age three until about age 21,

503
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,160
 pornography was a regular part of my life.

504
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,280
 I look back on my childhood

505
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
 and there are certainly a lot of great moments.

506
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
 I had a loving family and had a great family, great parents,

507
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
 but I look back on my childhood

508
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,120
 and there is also a tremendous amount of embarrassment.

509
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,960
 Being exposed to pornography at that young,

510
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,680
 that meant in those years when I was making decisions

511
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,960
 and I was involved in certain activities

512
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,580
 that were just embarrassing.

513
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,480
 And I felt like there was this part of my life

514
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
 that the thought of going back and revisiting that,

515
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,520
 the thought of going back in order to go forward,

516
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,560
 the thought of going back and maybe telling somebody else

517
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,580
 about those things was horrifying.

518
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,720
 And I remember there was just in that moment,

519
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
 I just said, "I'm gonna conceal this.

520
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,120
 I don't wanna talk to anybody about this.

521
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,680
 If that's what it takes to go forward,

522
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,160
 I'm fine not going forward."

523
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,360
 And so I'll never forget that night.

524
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
 I closed that chapter, I closed that book,

525
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,340
 I put it in my bag and I just said,

526
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,080
 "I wanna do anything I can

527
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,360
 to not think about my past right now."

528
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,640
 So I turned on the television

529
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,780
 and I slept that night with the lights on

530
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,840
 and I made sure for the next couple of weeks

531
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,360
 that I never was alone or quiet.

532
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,480
 I always wanted noise

533
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,040
 'cause I did not wanna go back there.

534
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,240
 I was feeling humiliated to think

535
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,360
 that I was gonna have to go back and somehow deal with this.

536
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,400
 I liked this Adam, I didn't like this Adam.

537
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,980
 I thought God liked this Adam,

538
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,000
 I didn't think God liked this Adam

539
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,360
 and I didn't wanna go back.

540
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,080
 Shame causes us to hide,

541
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
 it causes us to run

542
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,420
 and the reason that it's there

543
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,400
 is because we all feel this deep-seated inadequacy.

544
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,880
 We all know we've done things.

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,220
 We all know that we fall short of our own standard in life

546
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,600
 and that's the formula.

547
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,340
 That's the formula often is our inadequacy

548
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,780
 mixed with our pride

549
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,240
 and so that's the reason for our shame

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,240
 but let's keep going 'cause the story gets much better.

551
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,520
 So verse 45, Jesus said, "Who touched me?"

552
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,560
 When they all denied it, Peter said,

553
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,400
 "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."

554
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
 So you can imagine the scene, Jesus,

555
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,800
 he felt that somebody had touched him

556
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,480
 and he starts going around going, "Who was it?

557
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,560
 "Was it you, was it you, was it you, was it you?"

558
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
 And everybody denied it

559
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,240
 and then Peter finally steps up and just says,

560
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,640
 "Listen, there's a lot of people around

561
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,180
 "so maybe it was just somebody touched you by accident

562
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,120
 "or something like that."

563
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,700
 And Jesus said, "Someone touched me.

564
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,600
 "I know that power has gone out from me."

565
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,720
 And so let me just pause here

566
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
 and let's just have another observation

567
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,920
 and see where our lives kind of run parallel

568
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,800
 to this woman's life.

569
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
 But first, let me say this,

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,720
 Jesus knew exactly what he was doing.

571
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,760
 Jesus here wondering who touched him,

572
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,740
 it's not like Jesus was a character

573
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,080
 or a person in a video game

574
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,480
 that when he got hit and some power went down

575
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,500
 and he's just sitting around going,

576
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
 "All right, I saw my power levels go down, who hit me?"

577
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,240
 You know, he knew exactly what was going on.

578
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,540
 The point of this interaction

579
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,240
 and the reason why Luke was recording these details

580
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,400
 is because what was going on is that woman was gone.

581
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
 She had run, she wasn't there.

582
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,520
 And so the second observation that I wanna make is this,

583
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,360
 is that the reason for our shame is inadequacy and pride,

584
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,760
 but our response to shame,

585
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,000
 our response to shame is often the exact same

586
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
 as this woman's.

587
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,460
 Our response to shame is to run.

588
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,640
 It's to run.

589
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,520
 And so when we come over here and we have this ideal you

590
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,840
 and you're inadequate, and then there's this bad you,

591
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,960
 you don't wanna hang down here.

592
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,800
 And so what do you do?

593
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,620
 You run.

594
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,340
 You run.

595
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,560
 And you run to anything that you think

596
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,220
 is gonna get you back to the ideal you.

597
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,740
 And so some of you, what you do

598
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,760
 is you run to religious things.

599
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,600
 And let's just be honest,

600
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,780
 there's probably some of you in the room here tonight.

601
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,320
 And the reason you're here tonight

602
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,960
 is because you're trying to make up for something

603
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,080
 you did this weekend.

604
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,280
 And so you'll run to religious things,

605
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,160
 you'll run to church,

606
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,140
 you'll run to these religious activities

607
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,980
 where you're just going,

608
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,160
 all right, I'm gonna read my Bible every day,

609
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,560
 or I'm gonna serve every day,

610
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
 or I'm gonna give,

611
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,120
 or I'm gonna try to be others focused.

612
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,400
 And so you'll run over there,

613
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,120
 or you'll start to feel bad about yourself and inadequate.

614
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,480
 And so you're gonna run to the gym,

615
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,360
 you're gonna run to work,

616
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
 you're gonna run to Netflix,

617
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,320
 you're gonna run to podcasts,

618
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,640
 you're gonna run to anything that will get your mind

619
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,960
 off of thinking about your own inadequacy.

620
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,760
 And so when we start to feel the shame,

621
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,580
 we start to run, there's an activity,

622
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,700
 because it's intolerable,

623
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,540
 we always want to do something,

624
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,980
 and so we'll run towards these other activities,

625
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,300
 or we'll run away from certain activities

626
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,620
 and certain people.

627
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,560
 We'll run from God.

628
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
 We'll run from our friends.

629
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,180
 When do you wanna not answer the text

630
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,640
 from somebody in your community group

631
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,500
 on how are you doing?

632
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,820
 You wanna answer it about two or three hours

633
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,500
 after you've just faced your own inadequacy again,

634
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,160
 and you understand,

635
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,000
 and you're feeling all of this shame.

636
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,160
 What we start to realize with this, with shame, guys,

637
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
 is we start to realize this,

638
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,200
 is that this shame that we feel down there,

639
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,160
 it is really a gateway mood,

640
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,120
 it's a gateway emotion to other things.

641
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,280
 Oftentimes, because we feel the shame,

642
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,040
 this is where we bring about other destructive habits

643
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,860
 into our life.

644
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,000
 This is why we run to anger.

645
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,760
 This is why we run to addictions.

646
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,080
 This is why we're so anxious.

647
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,160
 It's not because we struggle with anxiety,

648
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,460
 it's because we struggle with shame.

649
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,780
 Or not because we struggle with drugs and alcohol,

650
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,980
 it's because we struggle with shame.

651
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,600
 We're trying to hide something.

652
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,660
 We're trying to get this feeling away

653
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,160
 from anything and everything except from Jesus.

654
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,480
 It just doesn't work.

655
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,320
 It just doesn't work.

656
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,500
 And so for my story,

657
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,040
 for my story, the gateway for me,

658
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,060
 when I was feeling shame,

659
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,260
 the gateway for me was anger.

660
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,100
 That's where I would go.

661
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,120
 I would go with anger.

662
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,920
 And so I remember very clearly,

663
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,420
 again, one of the times where this became so clear,

664
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,140
 that when I was feeling shame,

665
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,480
 I would act out in anger,

666
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,040
 and I thought I had an anger problem.

667
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,560
 And to my great shame right now,

668
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,680
 I need to share with you another story about a cat.

669
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,980
 And I now, I'm gonna go down as the guy

670
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,840
 that came to the porch and shared two stories about cats.

671
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,960
 Okay, so that's okay.

672
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,520
 So anyway, it's the same cat, Pedro.

673
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,880
 I am in my apartment.

674
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,440
 Again, we don't have kids.

675
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,640
 And for some reason, the memory that I have

676
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,980
 is I remember I was doing a puzzle.

677
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,400
 I think it was over Christmas.

678
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,320
 So it just makes the story even better, right?

679
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,720
 And I'm doing a puzzle.

680
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,560
 And I remember the cat kept getting up on the table

681
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,800
 and interrupting the puzzle

682
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
 and like moving all the pieces away.

683
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,600
 And I'm getting frustrated and I keep pushing the cat down.

684
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,400
 He jumps off, I push the cat down.

685
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,520
 He jumps on, I push the cat down.

686
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,300
 And I get so frustrated with him.

687
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,440
 Every time he jumps up there,

688
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,160
 I'm getting more and more frustrated.

689
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,320
 But then I also know that I'm starting to get frustrated

690
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,720
 that I'm getting frustrated.

691
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,880
 And I start to think I shouldn't be getting frustrated

692
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,240
 for a cat interrupting my puzzle right now.

693
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,440
 And so I finally, he jumps up there and I push him down

694
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,320
 and he kind of scurries on the table

695
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,740
 and all these pieces go flying.

696
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,800
 And I am so mad and so frustrated right now

697
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 that I just pick up the closest thing I can find,

698
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,280
 which is a bag of pretzels.

699
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,400
 And I chase him around the apartment

700
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,020
 and I throw the bag of pretzels at the cat,

701
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,920
 which does absolutely nothing to the cat.

702
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,520
 And all it does is pretzels and salt go flying everywhere,

703
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,120
 all over the apartment and all over the wood floors.

704
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,120
 And now there are just little granular pieces of salt

705
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,920
 and pretzel everywhere.

706
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,120
 And I'm sitting there and I'm just going,

707
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,740
 what is going on?

708
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,800
 And I remember I went to go talk to my friend

709
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,880
 and I was trying to process this with my friend.

710
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,660
 And I was just like, man, here's what happened.

711
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,080
 I tell you, man, I got an anger problem.

712
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,040
 I think I've got an anger problem.

713
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,960
 He said, well, tell me about it.

714
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
 And I'm going, this and this,

715
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,120
 and I threw the pretzels and salt went everywhere.

716
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,160
 And he's like, yeah, maybe an anger problem,

717
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
 but why were you angry?

718
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,560
 I said, why was I angry?

719
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
 Well, here's exactly why I was angry.

720
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,160
 I was angry because I was so frustrated

721
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,920
 at how flustered I was getting.

722
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,040
 I was angry because I just realized,

723
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,900
 Adam, you shouldn't be mad about this.

724
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,840
 Adam, you shouldn't be freaking out about this.

725
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,620
 Adam, you should be able to stay in control

726
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,460
 of your emotions.

727
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,840
 You should be calm.

728
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,800
 I mean, you've been following Jesus for almost 10 years now.

729
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,680
 Shouldn't you grow up beyond this silly little behavior

730
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,960
 where a little thing like this is frustrating you?

731
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,920
 And I'm just listing out all of these should,

732
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,660
 should, should, should, should.

733
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,840
 And he's just going, listen, man,

734
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,400
 I just wanna help you and connect these dots here.

735
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,480
 Your anger, your anger is you're trying to run.

736
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,360
 It's rooted in your shame.

737
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,100
 That's where that anger comes from.

738
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 And so shame causes us to run towards things.

739
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,560
 And what we all know in here,

740
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,160
 and every single one of us would admit this,

741
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
 is whatever it is that you do that you run

742
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,840
 to try to get back to the ideal you,

743
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,780
 what you know is this, it doesn't work.

744
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,560
 It doesn't work.

745
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,200
 And that's why you keep going back over and over

746
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
 and over and over again.

747
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,420
 And that's why this cycle continues in our life

748
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,920
 is because our strategies for dealing with shame

749
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,460
 that don't involve Jesus do not work.

750
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,120
 Because no matter where you run,

751
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,480
 no matter where you try to hide, you're always there.

752
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,900
 And our strategies don't help us at all.

753
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,100
 So the reason for our shame is this inadequacy

754
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,560
 and this pride, and our response to shame

755
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,560
 is typically to run, but there's a remedy.

756
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,460
 There's a remedy that this woman encountered,

757
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,800
 and there's a remedy for all of us that we can encounter.

758
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,640
 And so let's look at this.

759
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600
 Let's look how this story wraps up here.

760
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,520
 Jesus said, "Someone touched me.

761
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,760
 "I know that power has gone out for me," in verse 46.

762
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,960
 Here's what he says in verse 47.

763
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,480
 "Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed,

764
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,240
 "came trembling and fell at his feet.

765
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,800
 "In the presence of all the people,

766
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,680
 "she told why she had touched him

767
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,620
 "and how she had been instantly healed.

768
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,320
 "And then he said to her daughter,

769
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,880
 "Your faith has healed you.

770
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,200
 "Go in peace."

771
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,640
 I don't know if we can recreate the tension and the emotion

772
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,240
 and the relief and the embarrassment and the anxiety

773
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,560
 and all of that that that woman probably was feeling,

774
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,660
 but all I know is this, is it seems like

775
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,820
 she was ready to quit hiding.

776
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,680
 She was ready to quit hiding,

777
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,000
 and when Jesus kept calling out

778
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,620
 and she knew that the Lord was calling her,

779
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,640
 and that's why he was saying, "I know power went out."

780
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,840
 He wanted to draw this woman out,

781
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,880
 and she just finally said, "I'm done running.

782
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,200
 "I'm done trying to hide."

783
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,160
 And she fell at his feet.

784
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:04,200
 And in front of everyone, that whole crowd that was there,

785
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,440
 she admitted, "Here's why I touched your cloak.

786
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
 "Here's what's going on in my life."

787
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,340
 So she was incredibly vulnerable,

788
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,840
 and she laid it at the feet of Jesus.

789
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,240
 And what she wanted when she went to go find

790
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,780
 and sneak up to Jesus, what she wanted was healing.

791
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,060
 And she got healing,

792
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,340
 but she got something way more than that too,

793
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,100
 is that she got a relationship, a relationship with God.

794
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,540
 She got grace.

795
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,900
 She was now no longer this recluse.

796
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,160
 She was now a daughter of the king.

797
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,380
 She came looking for healing,

798
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,780
 and what she got was not just that,

799
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,140
 but she got a restored relationship with God.

800
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,720
 She was no longer a social outcast.

801
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,580
 And so this third observation that we'll make

802
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,180
 just as we wrap up tonight is this,

803
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,020
 is that the remedy for our shame

804
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,200
 is to come to terms with reality.

805
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,820
 This woman just came to terms with reality.

806
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,020
 I can't hide anymore.

807
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,500
 I gotta go just bring it to Jesus.

808
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,380
 She came to terms with reality.

809
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,100
 And so the remedy for my shame and for your shame

810
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,560
 is not just to keep running.

811
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,780
 Because if we keep running,

812
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,500
 we're just gonna stay on this cycle,

813
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,820
 and it's just gonna keep going and going and going.

814
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,020
 And so I have some bad news for you.

815
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,800
 The bad news is this is true.

816
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,860
 This is true about you.

817
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,300
 There are moments in your life

818
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,400
 where you can be the ideal you.

819
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,420
 There's moments in your life

820
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,640
 where whatever it is that you think you should do,

821
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
 you can do it.

822
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,420
 You can achieve that.

823
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,020
 You can act a certain way

824
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,140
 for a certain period of time in your own strength.

825
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,540
 But what else is true about you

826
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,960
 is that you are wholly inadequate

827
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
 to keep it up for a long period of time.

828
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,060
 And what's also equally true about you

829
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,060
 is there's a lot of bad in every single one of us.

830
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,700
 And the bad news is this,

831
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,400
 is that there is more bad in us,

832
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,980
 there is more inadequacy in us

833
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,060
 than there is ideal in us.

834
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,760
 But the good news is this,

835
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,340
 is that God is not surprised by any of that.

836
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,860
 And what's even better,

837
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,640
 even better news is He loves you anyway.

838
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,980
 That's what's called the gospel.

839
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,220
 That God saw here that we all fall short

840
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,240
 of the glory of God,

841
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,100
 that the wages of sin is death.

842
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,660
 He knows that this is who we are,

843
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,940
 and that not only do we feel bad about ourselves in this,

844
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,560
 but this fractures our relationship

845
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,700
 with the God of the universe.

846
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,160
 And the wages of that sin is death,

847
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,440
 but the free gift of God is eternal life

848
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
 through Christ Jesus.

849
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,400
 And so not only does this lead us on a cycle

850
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,360
 where we just feel this shame and this humiliation,

851
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,160
 this separates us from God.

852
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,420
 And God didn't wanna leave us there.

853
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,000
 And so He sent Jesus to die on the cross on our behalf.

854
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,260
 That's the good news.

855
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,120
 And so the reality though for us,

856
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,380
 the reality that we need to embrace is this,

857
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,440
 is that you and I,

858
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,840
 we need the gospel every single day of our life.

859
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,560
 You don't just need it one time

860
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
 to receive forgiveness for your sins,

861
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,980
 and then you don't need the gospel anymore.

862
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,080
 You need the gospel every single day of your life,

863
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,520
 because every day you are faced with your own inadequacy.

864
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,760
 You cannot be the person that you wanna be

865
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,000
 apart from Jesus.

866
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,560
 And I think for so many of us,

867
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,440
 part of the shame that we feel

868
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,200
 is that we feel ashamed that we need the gospel every day.

869
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,680
 We're just tired that we have to keep,

870
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,600
 that we keep failing

871
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,200
 and that we can't seem to string together a good season.

872
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,800
 And what really is going on is our pride is so high

873
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,440
 that we just are ashamed

874
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,120
 that we need the gospel every day,

875
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,020
 that we're a sinner in need of a savior,

876
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,320
 not one time for a lifetime.

877
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,160
 And may we never be ashamed of the gospel.

878
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,120
 May we be like Paul.

879
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,480
 Look at what he says here in Romans 1, verse 16.

880
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,240
 He says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel,

881
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,640
 "because it is the power of God

882
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,700
 "that brings salvation to everyone who believes,

883
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,740
 "first to the Jew and then to the Gentile.

884
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,960
 "For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed,

885
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,840
 "a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.

886
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,500
 "And just as it is written,

887
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,720
 "the righteous will live by faith."

888
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,280
 What Paul is saying there is,

889
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,320
 listen, I'm not ashamed of the gospel.

890
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,720
 I need the gospel every single day.

891
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,560
 You know why?

892
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,960
 Because my righteousness, my relationship with God

893
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,640
 is not based on my own activities.

894
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
 If it were based on my own activities, I'm sunk.

895
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,720
 I don't need a second chance.

896
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,300
 I've already blown the second chance.

897
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,960
 I need a savior.

898
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,920
 And I need that savior every single day.

899
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,960
 And I just wanna remind us tonight of this,

900
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,800
 is that when you say you're a Christian,

901
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,360
 when you claim to be a follower of Jesus Christ,

902
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,560
 that is a self-deprecating statement.

903
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,680
 You know what you're telling the world

904
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,860
 when you say I follow Jesus?

905
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,600
 You're saying I'm not good enough.

906
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,040
 I can't save myself.

907
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,160
 I can't string together enough good days.

908
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,840
 Left to myself, I'm going to hell.

909
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,960
 And I don't need a second chance.

910
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,600
 What I need is I need a savior,

911
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
 and that savior is Jesus Christ.

912
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,160
 And so I love that you get to hear that

913
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,120
 if this is your first time here at The Porch,

914
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,960
 'cause I'd imagine you come into a room like this

915
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,920
 and you see all these beautiful people in here

916
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,700
 raising their hands and they're singing,

917
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,640
 and you're maybe feeling shame and just going,

918
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,360
 all these people must be so good.

919
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,860
 They must be so good that they can sing and they smile

920
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,320
 and they look like they're in a good mood.

921
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,380
 And I just wanna let you know,

922
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,900
 if that's you and it's your first time,

923
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,800
 this room is not full of good people.

924
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,280
 This room is full of very bad people.

925
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,400
 In fact, let's just take a moment.

926
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,480
 Make sure your wallet is still there, ladies.

927
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,520
 Make sure your purse is still around, okay?

928
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,140
 'Cause there are bad people in here.

929
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,400
 This is not a museum of awesome.

930
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,460
 This is a hospital full of sick people

931
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,560
 who have found the healer in Jesus Christ, amen?

932
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
 Amen.

933
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,720
 The only way, the only way to get off this shame cycle

934
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
 is you've gotta run somewhere else.

935
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,360
 The only way is that you've gotta run to Jesus.

936
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
 That's how you get off the shame cycle.

937
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,040
 So the source, the reason for our shame

938
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,760
 is inadequacy and pride,

939
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,100
 'cause we know that we cannot be who we wanna be,

940
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,560
 and yet we're prideful and we're embarrassed about that.

941
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,300
 And so that's why we feel this need

942
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,160
 and this humiliation to conceal and hide.

943
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,780
 And we end up running because shame is intolerable.

944
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,300
 We run to something.

945
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,540
 We run to things or we run from people or from God.

946
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,040
 And those solutions never work.

947
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,020
 The only remedy is to come to terms with reality

948
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,660
 and that we need the gospel every single day.

949
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,980
 And so I'll close with this one last story

950
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,420
 when the end of the shame cycle

951
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,300
 became very clear in my life.

952
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
 And so I had that night in Huntsville, Alabama.

953
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,380
 I read that book and I was like,

954
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,900
 I just want to forget all of my past.

955
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,020
 I don't wanna go back and talk about anything.

956
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,140
 And I drove back to Atlanta and went a few days

957
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,680
 of just trying to isolate and trying to ignore.

958
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,780
 And it just, it was overwhelming.

959
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,920
 The shame was overwhelming.

960
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,460
 And I finally just said, I've got to tell somebody.

961
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,580
 So I got a couple of friends together

962
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,420
 and I just said, listen, we've been friends for a while.

963
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,460
 You know a lot about me, but you don't know everything.

964
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,320
 And I'm feeling overwhelmed with a sense of humiliation.

965
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,860
 And I just, I don't know how you're gonna react to this.

966
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,980
 I'm afraid of how you're gonna react to this,

967
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,580
 but I'm just gonna tell you everything.

968
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,780
 And so here's what happened when I was three.

969
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,800
 And then here's what happened in my elementary school years.

970
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,340
 And then here's what middle school was like.

971
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,620
 And here's what high school was like.

972
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,880
 And here's what college was like

973
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
 before I came to know Jesus.

974
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,500
 And I did this and then I thought that.

975
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,780
 And then I used to believe this.

976
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,060
 And then there was this experience.

977
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,220
 And I just laid it all out there.

978
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,180
 And it was so terrifying

979
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,780
 'cause I had no clue what they were gonna do.

980
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,640
 I didn't know if somebody would love me anyway.

981
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,660
 So I laid it all out there and I was just amazed

982
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,860
 at the amount of grace and mercy that was shown to me

983
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,940
 as I shared all of those things.

984
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,860
 And my friends looked at me and they said, me too.

985
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
 Yeah, maybe it looks a little bit different, Adam.

986
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,140
 Maybe it's not the exact same facts and circumstances,

987
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,080
 but let me tell you all the things that I'm embarrassed about.

988
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,540
 Let me tell you all the things that I am humiliated by.

989
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,700
 We just in that moment just got into this habit

990
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,160
 of being able to share these things

991
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,140
 that normally would plague us and be this cycle of shame

992
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,580
 and try to drive us to run from God

993
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,120
 or run to some religious activity

994
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,220
 to try to make ourselves feel better.

995
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,620
 And we just got in this habit of trying

996
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,960
 to just confess these things to one another.

997
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,380
 And so now for the past 10 or 15 years,

998
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,820
 that's how I deal with shame.

999
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:41,220
 That's the remedy is that you run to Jesus

1000
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,860
 and you often by running to Jesus,

1001
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,500
 you run to Jesus's people.

1002
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,220
 And when you run to Jesus and you run to Jesus's people

1003
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,400
 and you just start to go, listen,

1004
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,540
 this is what I'm afraid of.

1005
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,380
 This is what I think you're gonna leave me over.

1006
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,420
 What you realize is that Proverbs 28 is true,

1007
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,700
 that whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,

1008
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:05,920
 but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.

1009
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,600
 And so my challenge for all of us here tonight is this,

1010
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,440
 it's just really simple,

1011
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,600
 it's just to run to Jesus, get off that cycle.

1012
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,480
 We all do it, we've all got the cycle,

1013
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,400
 we've all got inadequacy in our life,

1014
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,280
 we've all got these things that are humiliating

1015
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,120
 that we wanna hide,

1016
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,200
 we've got stories that we don't wanna share.

1017
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,860
 And so my challenge to you is to get off the cycle

1018
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,240
 and to run to the cross,

1019
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,340
 and to first and foremost,

1020
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,660
 recognize and realize that God loves you anyway.

1021
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,980
 There's intimacy there, He's not afraid of that,

1022
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,980
 He knows all of those things, you've been found out already.

1023
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,340
 And by running to Jesus, you can then run to His people

1024
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,380
 and you can tell someone.

1025
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,540
 So if that's you here tonight and you walked in

1026
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,200
 and you're just plagued by this shame

1027
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,180
 and you know that it's this gateway mood

1028
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,220
 or this gateway emotion

1029
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,500
 and there's all kinds of other destructive behaviors

1030
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,540
 in your life tonight,

1031
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,740
 I'm telling you, you can get off that cycle,

1032
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,080
 you can stop it tonight.

1033
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,780
 The people that brought you here tonight,

1034
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,060
 you can talk to them,

1035
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,580
 the group of us down here at the end,

1036
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,600
 we'd love to talk to you or to point you

1037
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
 to other people that can help,

1038
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,160
 there's a way off that cycle.

1039
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,460
 So we're all inadequate, we all struggle with pride,

1040
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,380
 we all wanna run somewhere and the remedy is found

1041
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,860
 when we embrace this reality

1042
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,700
 that we are sinners in need of a Savior

1043
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,260
 and that Savior is Jesus and we run to Him, amen?

1044
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,120
 Amen, let's pray.

1045
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:34,740
 Lord, we thank you for the cross.

1046
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,900
 We thank you that we can share embarrassing stories

1047
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,900
 and inadequacies in our own life with one another

1048
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,340
 and we're just grateful we can do that, God.

1049
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
 We're grateful that we can confess these things to you

1050
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,740
 and that you love us anyway.

1051
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:58,700
 We're grateful, Lord, that our deepest fears of rejection

1052
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,380
 are just cast aside when we come to the foot of the cross.

1053
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,700
 We're grateful, Lord, stories like of this woman

1054
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,220
 that our lives parallel that we can identify with

1055
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,660
 and I pray that all of us here tonight

1056
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,920
 will experience that same grace and mercy

1057
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,060
 that that woman experienced

1058
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,940
 when she fell at your feet, Jesus.

1059
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,700
 And so, Lord, we just thank you for the gospel

1060
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,380
 that our relationship with you is not founded on what we do

1061
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,100
 but on what you did.

1062
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,780
 And so, God, we worship you not because we're good.

1063
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,700
 We worship you because you're good and you forgive

1064
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,720
 and you are full of grace and mercy.

1065
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,420
 And so, Lord, my friends tonight that are just trembling,

1066
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,460
 that are afraid to tell somebody,

1067
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,300
 I pray that you'll give them courage, Lord.

1068
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,380
 That they'll talk to friends,

1069
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,580
 that they'll talk to other followers of you.

1070
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,900
 And they'll be able to experience the freedom

1071
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,380
 that comes from running to the cross.

1072
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,860
 And we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.

1073
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:08,860
