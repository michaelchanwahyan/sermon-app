1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,480
 - All right, welcome to The Porch.

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,380
 Welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,920
 friends in Houston and Fort Worth and downtown Dallas

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,000
 kicking off tonight at Gillies.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,120
 Welcome friends for the first night down there.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,760
 A few years ago, I guess it was a couple years ago,

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,360
 JP called me and said,

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,720
 "Hey, there's a vacation deal that I've got with,

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,680
 "somebody basically sent me and I have this vacation deal.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,180
 "Would you and your wife wanna come with me and my wife?

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,800
 "We're gonna Mexico, hang out at a resort.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,720
 "It'll be a vacation, won't bring kids.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,800
 "It'll be awesome."

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,160
 And it's a crazy steal of a deal

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
 because the hotel was finishing up kind of construction.

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,320
 It was just finishing up.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
 And so it was like a thousand dollars

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 for two people for a week.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,400
 It was an unbelievable deal.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,740
 And I was like, "Yes, duh."

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,760
 So we loaded up, went to Mexico, got there, really excited.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,080
 This is gonna be awesome.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,720
 And all of us get to the hotel resort

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,320
 and begin to check in at the hotel.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,200
 And there were two sides to the hotel resort.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,700
 There was this family side where kids were everywhere

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,040
 and it was kind of different restaurants.

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,180
 And then there was this adults only side called heaven.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,840
 And true story.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,400
 And we were told that we would be on the family side.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
 And so it was like, "This will be great.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
 "And it'll be fun."

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,040
 Anyways, we go to check in and JP and Monica,

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,320
 they're put on the family side.

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,440
 And then they say, "You, David, and your wife, Callie,

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 "are on the adults only side.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
 "You're in heaven."

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,440
 And immediately I'm like,

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,120
 "Oh man, we're not gonna be with our friends.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,080
 "But I think we're gonna have to head over to heaven

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,260
 "and leave these guys with the kids.

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,480
 "So I hate that for you guys.

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 "You can come over and see us."

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,980
 So immediately we're like seeing visions of,

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,020
 "Oh, this is gonna be great.

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,140
 "We're gonna be hanging out with no kids running around.

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,960
 "They're over there in Chuck E. Cheese essentially.

49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,060
 "And we're over here.

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,540
 "We've got young adult couple friends

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,560
 "that are gonna be making memories.

52
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
 "It's gonna be great.

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
 "We'll let them come over

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
 "and hang out at our place during the week.

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,700
 "But this is gonna be amazing."

56
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,620
 So they take us to the different rooms

57
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,540
 and we get on this golf cart

58
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,800
 and they begin to drive us over to heaven.

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,480
 And very quickly it begins the picture

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,200
 that I had in my mind about the people

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
 that would be on that side

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,720
 and what it would look like begins to dramatically change

63
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,120
 because it was like we checked in on the family side

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,360
 and everything as we went in the direction of heaven,

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
 all of a sudden got darker and darker.

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
 And it was like we entered into the construction zone.

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,920
 Everywhere that you look, there's construction,

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,520
 there's caution tape going on.

69
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,760
 We literally had to go underneath a painting tarp

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,600
 to get to our room.

71
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,360
 We're like, "This is not exactly

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,600
 "what I thought heaven was gonna look like.

73
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
 "This looks more like hell."

74
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,840
 And we're heading into our room

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,720
 and there's literally construction people everywhere.

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,240
 Like there's just individuals with hard hats.

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,540
 There was only one other couple that we saw over there.

78
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,640
 It was almost like all of the family side was full

79
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
 and they were like, "Well, we can send these guys

80
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
 "over there, they'll think it's great."

81
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
 And so we're getting over there.

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,160
 True story, we go inside of our room.

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,400
 The tub is not finished yet,

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,080
 so we don't have access to the tub or the shower.

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
 And as soon as it's like, it was like on cue,

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
 when we put our bags down, all of a sudden,

87
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,960
 (imitates jackhammer)

88
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,960
 there's a jackhammer right outside of our window.

89
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,520
 I look out, there's a guy in a hard hat jackhammering away.

90
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,180
 At like nine o'clock at night, I'm like,

91
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
 "Oh my gosh, where are we right now?

92
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,120
 "This is not what I expected heaven

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,960
 "to look like and there's construction people everywhere.

94
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,880
 "This is not what I thought, who I thought

95
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,580
 "would be amongst our friends over in heaven."

96
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,960
 Clearly we had been surprised.

97
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,400
 And the reason I start there is just like in that situation

98
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,040
 where when it came to what I had imagined

99
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,720
 or what I pictured in terms of who would be in heaven

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,360
 and what it would look like and what it would be like,

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,160
 tonight, we're gonna continue this series,

102
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,700
 Bad Advice and look at a equally as shocking

103
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,800
 for many people, someday we'll find out,

104
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,840
 the belief that they have about what heaven will be like

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,120
 and who is there is radically different

106
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,720
 than they think or they expect.

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,680
 Like in that same way that we didn't expect it

108
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,000
 to be filled with construction workers,

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,980
 but it filled with friends or soon to be friends and fun,

110
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,480
 that in the same way that we were surprised

111
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,840
 to figure out who was there, in the same way,

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,280
 someday people will come to see those who are in heaven

113
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,240
 and be surprised.

114
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,560
 Specifically, the bad advice that many people believe

115
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,680
 that is not in line with what is true about heaven

116
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
 is that good people are in heaven,

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,920
 that good people go to heaven.

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,000
 The bad advice that we're gonna talk about tonight

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
 is this idea and one of the most pervasive,

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 widely held, most widely believed ideas

121
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,120
 and inside of this room, even many Christians

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
 have bought into this idea that's so common

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,700
 that good people go to heaven.

124
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,360
 That when you look at, hey, who are the people

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,320
 that are in heaven, it's good people.

126
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,480
 There is no single lie that is sending more people to hell

127
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,300
 on our planet than the idea that good people go to heaven,

128
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,440
 just be a good person.

129
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,840
 And maybe no idea as it relates to God

130
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,040
 more widely believed inside of our country,

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
 more tragically believed inside of our country

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
 than the idea that, yeah, good people go to heaven.

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
 I mean, God's up there and kind of to each his own

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
 and figured out and try to be a good person

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,080
 and just try to be a good, at the end of the day,

136
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,320
 we really don't know, so just try to be nice.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,080
 And I think the reason why a lot of people

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
 grab onto that idea is at some level, it makes sense.

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
 Like at some level, it kind of like jives

140
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
 with our feeling of fairness.

141
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,360
 Like it just seems like, yeah, it seems kind of fair

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,280
 that if you're a good person, it's a good God

143
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 and you'll go to a good heaven,

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,760
 so just kind of do your best.

145
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,940
 Nobody's perfect, so give it your best shot

146
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,680
 and as long as you're not Hitler,

147
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
 you'll probably end up in heaven.

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,000
 And then I think also it almost aligns

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,680
 with what every other world religion

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,760
 seems to kind of encourage.

151
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
 They all kind of encourage a good life,

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,200
 so try to be a good life.

153
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
 But it doesn't take long, if you think about it,

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
 to realize, man, there's some serious problems

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
 with the idea of good people going to heaven.

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
 One of them, namely the Bible,

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,680
 which we're gonna look at in a second,

158
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,540
 but even if you just like hit pause and you think about it,

159
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,120
 if good people go to heaven,

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,400
 you are immediately faced with the problem

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,860
 that we don't actually have the definition of what is good.

162
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,800
 You think about this?

163
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,240
 There's no universally accepted definition of what's good.

164
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,440
 Stay with me and we're gonna dive into what Paul says

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
 as it relates to this idea,

166
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
 but if good people go to heaven,

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,480
 then how do we know what is good?

168
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,040
 People disagree and we're Americans,

169
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
 so we think, no, everybody pretty much

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
 thinks the same thing.

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,880
 There are people all over the world

172
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,820
 who very much disagree about what is good.

173
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,600
 There are people who will say it is the ultimate good.

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
 You will go to the highest level of heaven

175
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,840
 if you put a suicide vest on you

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,060
 and go into a stadium and blow up little children.

177
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,400
 There are people who think that's not only good,

178
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,920
 that's the highest level of heaven good.

179
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
 Think about that.

180
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,400
 And then there's people who think

181
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
 that's one of the greatest,

182
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,840
 you will not spend eternity with God

183
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,340
 for doing something like that.

184
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,280
 That's one of the greatest evils you can commit.

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,380
 There isn't a universally accepted consensus of,

186
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,120
 hey, just be a good person.

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,660
 Not only do we not know what good is,

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,160
 there's not even a clear,

189
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,220
 you would think if that really system kinda worked,

190
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,080
 we would have some idea of like,

191
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,840
 hey, how much good you have to be or what's passing.

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,480
 Like how good is good enough, it's been said.

193
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,200
 Like what is kinda, is it 51%?

194
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,840
 You just kinda kinda tip the scale a little bit.

195
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,920
 Maybe it's 70%.

196
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
 Is that where the grading system came from?

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,640
 Like, hey, as long as you get a C,

198
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,840
 you're pretty much in the good to go.

199
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,320
 Is it grading on a curve?

200
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,960
 Is Mother Teresa, is she kinda got the 99

201
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,660
 and all of us, however close you can get to her

202
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,480
 is really how good you have to be

203
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,780
 will determine where you spend eternity.

204
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,880
 And I know that sounds silly, but think about it.

205
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,040
 If good people go to heaven, we're in a lot of trouble

206
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,600
 'cause we don't know what good is.

207
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,080
 And even if we did, we don't know what passing is.

208
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,200
 We don't know what, how many points we get

209
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
 for different good actions

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
 and how many to minus for bad actions.

211
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,940
 And finally, the biggest reason why is the Bible

212
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,480
 and what God's word or what the scriptures tell us

213
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
 about this idea of good people go to heaven.

214
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,640
 Because if you're gonna stand on the idea of,

215
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,420
 hey, good people go to heaven,

216
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,200
 you cannot stand on what God's word says.

217
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,240
 You won't find that idea in here.

218
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
 And Paul's gonna lay that out tonight,

219
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,120
 the biggest problems as it relates to this idea.

220
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
 So we're gonna be in Romans chapter three.

221
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,160
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,400
 to Romans chapter three, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,

223
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,280
 Acts, Romans, and it'll be up on the screens.

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,160
 If you don't have a Bible, if you don't have a Bible,

225
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,120
 we have some in Dallas in the Welcome Center

226
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,580
 that is a free gift to you.

227
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,040
 You can go by afterwards and get that.

228
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,900
 You can download an app on your phone too as well.

229
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,640
 But Romans chapter three, we're gonna start

230
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
 in verse 10 of chapter three.

231
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,280
 Romans was a letter written by the apostle Paul

232
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,920
 to the church in Rome around 57 AD.

233
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,880
 So 30 years after Jesus resurrects, goes to heaven,

234
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,700
 the church begins, the apostle Paul was the artist

235
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,560
 or the apostle formerly known as Saul,

236
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,400
 tried to kill Christians, converts,

237
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,040
 becomes a believer in Jesus, radically gives his life

238
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
 to see Jesus made known everywhere.

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,980
 He writes his longest work, Romans.

240
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,680
 Romans has been called the greatest book

241
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
 ever penned by a human.

242
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
 And the chapter that we're gonna look at tonight,

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,960
 specifically one of the paragraphs we're gonna read,

244
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,000
 has been called the greatest words ever written

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
 by a person of all time,

246
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 the greatest paragraph in human existence.

247
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
 So tonight we're gonna start in verse 10

248
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,360
 and we'll track through what Paul says

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 is the problem with the idea, the belief

250
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,860
 that good people go to heaven.

251
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,020
 Here's what he says, verse 10, second half.

252
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,240
 There is no one righteous, or no one who has

253
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,120
 a right standing, is that word righteous.

254
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,120
 Righteous is not a word we use a ton outside of church maybe

255
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,940
 but no one who has a right standing

256
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,760
 or an okay relationship with God.

257
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 No one who stands and can stand before God perfectly.

258
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
 There's not even one.

259
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,680
 No one who understands, no one who seeks God.

260
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
 That Christianity doesn't teach that we find God,

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,040
 it really teaches that God finds you.

262
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,880
 That if you ever come to faith and I ever come to faith,

263
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,560
 it comes in a moment where God, apart from God,

264
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
 we don't seek him but he seeks out us.

265
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
 We're gonna keep going.

266
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,360
 All have turned away.

267
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,780
 Together they have become worthless.

268
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,500
 There is no one who does good, not even one.

269
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,620
 That Paul says by God's standard of righteousness

270
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,580
 or God's standard of what is good,

271
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,240
 that there is not a single person who has ever lived

272
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
 who is good, who's seeking after God,

273
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,200
 who is righteous, who acts righteously.

274
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
 That according to God's standard,

275
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,760
 which clearly must be a very different standard than ours

276
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,000
 and we'll talk about it in a second,

277
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
 that there is not a single person on the planet.

278
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,100
 The problem with being, hey, just good people go to heaven

279
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,840
 is Paul would say there are no good people.

280
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,000
 So if that's the standard, nobody gets in.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,280
 Our first idea from the text is really

282
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
 that no one is good enough for heaven.

283
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,040
 No one is good enough for heaven,

284
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,680
 which I think just doesn't sit well with us as Americans

285
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,940
 because I read that and I go, man,

286
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,400
 I feel like I've seen some good people,

287
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,840
 people who do heroic actions, they do good things,

288
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,400
 they care for elderly people.

289
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
 You watch some Facebook video

290
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,120
 that people are sending around and you're like,

291
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
 gosh, I just am restored faith in humanity.

292
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,200
 This is beautiful.

293
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,500
 This guy stopped to go help this guy's tire.

294
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,620
 Paul would say that what makes someone good,

295
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,020
 or heaven's definition of goodness is very different

296
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,140
 than a human's definition of goodness.

297
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,900
 Like a human definition of goodness is,

298
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,100
 hey, they're good for the most part.

299
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,480
 You ever think about that?

300
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,940
 Like a human definition is like,

301
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,240
 ah, yeah, you know, they're pretty much good

302
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,340
 for the most part.

303
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,660
 They got a good heart, good guy.

304
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,960
 Heaven's definition is good in every part.

305
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,380
 The reason that no one is good enough,

306
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,920
 a reason heaven can say, hey, there is no one who's good.

307
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,300
 As good as you think you are,

308
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,180
 as good as your grandma thinks you are,

309
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,860
 you are not good by God's standard, by heaven's standard,

310
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,980
 because it's not just good for the most part,

311
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
 it's good in every part.

312
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,900
 It's not just similar to, I've been like gone,

313
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,260
 traveling for the past couple weeks and got back in town,

314
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,540
 and we had all this different food,

315
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,980
 and if you travel and you come back home,

316
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,100
 there's food, what happens to it?

317
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,020
 It begins to like rot and spoil, right?

318
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,860
 You go to get the milk and all of a sudden you're like,

319
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,060
 oh, this is expired, how bad is this?

320
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,140
 Pour it on the cereal.

321
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,400
 And here's what happens whenever like milk has gone bad,

322
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
 and it's like beginning to curdle.

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,960
 I never once am like,

324
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,280
 ah, let me get the drainer, strainer out here

325
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
 and just pour that out, get those things out of there,

326
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,680
 dump it out and then put it in this thing.

327
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,520
 No, nobody does that.

328
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
 Why, because they're not like,

329
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,340
 oh, but there's still some that's good,

330
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,360
 I can still use that.

331
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,600
 No, you go, the entire thing has been rotted, it's all bad.

332
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,620
 The entire thing has spoiled.

333
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,700
 In the same way, heaven says, look, it's not,

334
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,440
 hey, it's kind of good for the most part here,

335
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,280
 there's just a few curdles.

336
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,820
 Heaven says the entire thing, if it's not all good,

337
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,700
 it is not good.

338
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,500
 Heaven's definition or God's standard,

339
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,440
 God's definition of what is good is very different,

340
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,360
 even if that's not sitting right with you.

341
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
 Like, no, I think people are good.

342
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,600
 God would say that's because you have

343
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,760
 a warped human definition of goodness.

344
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,520
 You've never seen perfect goodness.

345
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,080
 And the problem with good people go to heaven

346
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,040
 is that no one is good.

347
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,120
 No one is good in every part, even the Bible.

348
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
 Let me just remove this.

349
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
 If it's your first time back in church, maybe in a while,

350
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,040
 or maybe you were raised and maybe you grew up

351
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
 in denomination or expression of faith,

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,820
 and you're just kind of like, isn't the Bible, though,

353
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,560
 about good people, kind of these different stories

354
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,000
 about good people who lived, and they lived these lives,

355
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
 and they lived good lives,

356
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,960
 and we should try to be like them?

357
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,740
 The Bible's not full of stories about good people.

358
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,460
 Like, and I mean that very literally.

359
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,120
 If you read inside of the stories, you're like,

360
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,000
 wait a second, it's not filled with stories of good guys?

361
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,700
 What about Abraham?

362
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,060
 Abraham pimped out his wife twice,

363
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,780
 which is at least two times too many.

364
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,620
 Can we all agree?

365
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,020
 [congregation laughing]

366
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,660
 I mean, literally, he was like afraid they're gonna kill me.

367
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,540
 Ah, she's not my wife, she's my sister.

368
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,060
 Peace out, see you in a little bit, okay.

369
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,980
 That's what Abraham did.

370
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,140
 And you know, all right, what about David?

371
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,820
 David kills one of his best friend

372
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,800
 after sleeping in and impregnating his wife.

373
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,660
 That he sleeps with one of his best friend's wife,

374
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,620
 gets her pregnant, and then to cover it up,

375
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,840
 he has his best friend or one of his best friends killed.

376
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,200
 I mean, we won't even let you serve at the porch

377
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
 if you do that kind of thing.

378
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
 David's writing the Bible.

379
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,920
 You think this is like filled with good stories,

380
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,280
 good people, Moses kills a guy with his bare hands.

381
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,620
 Paul spent his life, as the artist formerly known as Saul,

382
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,360
 trying to kill, or the first half of his life,

383
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,520
 trying to kill Christians,

384
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,200
 going around trying to stomp out Christianity.

385
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,140
 Peter, maybe like, well, Peter's kind of good guy.

386
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,560
 Peter betrays Jesus three times

387
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,080
 on his, in Jesus's worst hour of need.

388
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,620
 And then even after Jesus rises from the dead

389
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
 and Peter's go get him leader of the church,

390
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,580
 Peter gets called out very early in church history

391
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,540
 by Paul for being racist.

392
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,720
 You're gonna read it in Acts chapter 15.

393
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,700
 And these are not stories of men who are like,

394
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,140
 these are just incredible men,

395
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,740
 on and on through the list we could go.

396
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,620
 It's not a story of a bunch of good guys.

397
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,540
 It's a story of a bunch of bad guys and one good guy.

398
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,780
 And all the bad guys kill the one good guy.

399
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,220
 That's how bad all of humanity is.

400
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,620
 The one good guy named Jesus shows up

401
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,380
 and all the bad guys kill him.

402
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,480
 And that one good guy was God who came

403
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,660
 in the form of human flesh to die on a cross

404
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,220
 because there is no one good

405
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,660
 and no one good enough to heaven.

406
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,860
 And that God knew that and he sent himself

407
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,900
 or went into the world to die the death

408
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,220
 in our place that you and I deserved.

409
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,480
 I think that, man, it's so true.

410
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,140
 I think in like our, from a earth perspective,

411
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,180
 you go, man, it's hard to believe.

412
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,140
 I just don't understand.

413
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,700
 How can a God, perfect God, send people to hell?

414
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,320
 And I think that from heaven's perspective,

415
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,700
 maybe from the angel's perspective,

416
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,020
 that's not the question they wonder.

417
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,780
 It's how can a perfect God let any

418
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,180
 of these people into heaven?

419
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,300
 And Paul's gonna answer that question for us.

420
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,280
 He continues in verse 19.

421
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,340
 Now we know whatever the law says,

422
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,260
 as in the Old Testament,

423
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,140
 it says to those who are under the law.

424
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,260
 So he's talking about to Jewish people.

425
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,820
 So whatever the law of the Old Testament says,

426
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,460
 it says to those who are under the law,

427
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,420
 so that every mouth may be silenced

428
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,220
 and the whole world held accountable to God.

429
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,480
 What are you saying, Paul?

430
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,020
 Paul just said that, hey, in case you're thinking,

431
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,020
 well, the only reason that people break the law

432
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,380
 or Gentiles, which is non-Jews, break the law

433
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
 is they don't have the law.

434
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,140
 They drove over the speed limit

435
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,080
 because they don't know the speed limit.

436
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,680
 And Paul says that even people who had the law

437
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,220
 or who knew the speed limit,

438
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,280
 they still drive over the speed limit

439
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,240
 or they still broke the speed limit.

440
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,940
 Everyone is held accountable.

441
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,040
 Everyone before God has fallen short

442
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,560
 and has not kept the law or the laws of God.

443
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,680
 He continues and says it's clear as any verse

444
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,840
 that we're gonna look at or any verse

445
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,240
 that you could apply towards any world religion,

446
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,680
 any verse that will clear up the false idea

447
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,520
 that, hey, if you're good, if you do the good things

448
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,600
 and be obedient, then God will love you,

449
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,640
 you'll earn a relationship.

450
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,680
 Here's what he says.

451
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,680
 Therefore, verse 20, no one will be declared righteous

452
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 in God's sight by observing the law.

453
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,800
 No one will be declared righteous with God

454
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
 by observing or by obeying what God's word,

455
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,380
 God's law says.

456
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,220
 Think about that.

457
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,800
 That there is no one who will be declared

458
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,520
 if they do enough things, they follow the law,

459
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,480
 they do the right things, that they will be,

460
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,160
 they'll earn a relationship with God.

461
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,300
 They'll be good enough.

462
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,920
 Rather, through the law, we become conscious of sin.

463
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,200
 He basically says what all of us have experienced.

464
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,900
 It's like the law isn't a reminder

465
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,000
 of how great we're doing.

466
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,680
 The law is really there only in a way

467
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,240
 that points out when we fail to meet it.

468
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,920
 In other words, I've never had a police officer,

469
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,000
 you never had a police officer that just pulls you over

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
 and is like, hey, I just wanna like clap it,

471
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
 slow clap for you for driving the speed limit.

472
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
 Like, that was awesome.

473
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
 They pull you over when you break the law.

474
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,160
 They're not like, IRS didn't show up and is like,

475
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,920
 man, I just feel like you've been doing so great

476
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,200
 at paying your taxes on time, way to go.

477
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,080
 This is awesome.

478
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,700
 No, they say, hey, you haven't been paying your taxes

479
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,280
 on time, you only see the expressions of the law

480
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 when you break the law.

481
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,720
 Paul says that's because the law doesn't do anything

482
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,360
 to save you, it just points out where you fall short.

483
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,320
 And no one, by obeying the law,

484
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,300
 will earn the right to have a relationship with God.

485
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
 Paul brings us to our second idea, which is doing good

486
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,840
 will not make you good enough for heaven.

487
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,400
 That there is no one good, Paul says, no one who is good.

488
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,320
 And that doing good, you trying to be a good person,

489
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,700
 trying to live a good life,

490
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,680
 try to follow the good book, will not earn you the right

491
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,160
 to have a relationship with God in eternity.

492
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
 It will not allow you to enter heaven.

493
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
 That if you and I, or which is what every world religion

494
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,620
 teaches, Paul says, following the law does not earn

495
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
 the favor of God.

496
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,980
 No one will be made good or good enough by doing good.

497
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,660
 I mean, if you really think about it,

498
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,360
 here's what doesn't always make sense to me.

499
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,600
 I think that a lot of people behind the idea of like,

500
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,300
 hey, if you do a good person, just do enough good

501
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,960
 that outweighs the bad, as though there's a justice system

502
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,280
 somewhere on the planet where that would actually

503
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,120
 make sense.

504
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,140
 Like, hey, as long as you do enough good,

505
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,160
 it can make up for any bad that you do.

506
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,080
 I mean, think about that.

507
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
 In what universe would that actually work?

508
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,240
 What universe would a lawyer stand with his client

509
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,040
 and be like, yes, so he shot the guy in the leg,

510
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,840
 but he hasn't shot any other guys in the leg.

511
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,120
 Yeah, he defrauded the IRS, but look at all the years

512
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
 he hasn't defrauded the IRS.

513
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
 And what universe does like, oh, I've been pretty much

514
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
 doing meeting the standard most of the time,

515
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,480
 and that will make up for when I don't meet the standard.

516
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,320
 There's no justice system in our country

517
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,440
 that would say that's okay.

518
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,020
 No justice system that would say, if someone wrecked

519
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,280
 into your car and did a hit and run, and they found him,

520
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,560
 and they found him out, and he was like, look, time out,

521
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,600
 how about I just mow your lawn for the next six weeks?

522
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,880
 Would that, are we cooled in?

523
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,920
 Or whatever amount of time would be equal to it.

524
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,760
 No.

525
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,960
 That there has to be a consequence.

526
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,620
 The idea of doing good doesn't make up for bad.

527
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,420
 Even on this planet, let alone with a holy, perfect God

528
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,280
 and his standard.

529
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,780
 Jesus even said, in Jesus' first sermon

530
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,820
 in Matthew chapter five, so he did a sermon on the mount,

531
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,260
 and like 15 verses in, very early,

532
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,180
 some of the first words we hear of Jesus,

533
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,640
 he looks into this audience of people,

534
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,440
 and he looks over at this group of men called Pharisees.

535
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,340
 Pharisees were professional do-gooders.

536
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,220
 It's all that they did, literally.

537
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,620
 They didn't have jobs.

538
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,140
 They were professionals at keeping God's law.

539
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,140
 They had memorized the entire Old Testament in Hebrew.

540
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,060
 Most of you haven't read the Old Testament.

541
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,140
 They had memorized the entire thing.

542
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,860
 They were men who literally didn't have jobs.

543
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,260
 Hey, I would, but I'm serving God.

544
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,060
 I'm keeping every single one of these laws.

545
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,180
 I'm perfect.

546
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,240
 Or to the law, I am as good as they're gonna come.

547
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,980
 And Jesus looks over to these men who devoted everything.

548
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,180
 I mean, they didn't sleep, drink, chew, date girls who do.

549
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,220
 Anything like that.

550
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
 And Jesus looks at them and he says,

551
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,220
 unless you are a better person than these guys,

552
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,080
 you will not enter heaven.

553
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,300
 Think about that.

554
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,360
 I mean, for us, for normal people, we'd be like,

555
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,140
 oh my gosh, yep, I got no chance.

556
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,460
 These guys literally, that's all that they do,

557
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,340
 is do what God's word says.

558
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,980
 And Jesus says, unless you're even better than them,

559
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,220
 you will not enter into heaven.

560
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,220
 He says, you will not enter into heaven, is his point,

561
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,560
 by being a good person.

562
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,580
 There is only one way.

563
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,660
 And he's gonna tell us that inside of the next point

564
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,580
 where he lays out, but probably the clearest example

565
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,340
 that we have in scripture of not a person

566
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,380
 who spends their life obeying everything

567
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,940
 and Jesus saying, hey, that's not gonna work,

568
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,400
 but the opposite, a person who spends his life

569
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,460
 literally running from God.

570
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,260
 A person who ended up having to experience the death penalty

571
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,880
 because he was a criminal.

572
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,100
 A person who had done nothing right in his life.

573
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,820
 In other words, if they had done everything right,

574
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,420
 this guy had done nothing right.

575
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,420
 It happens, we're told the story in Luke chapter 23,

576
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,180
 which Luke is just one of the gospels.

577
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,780
 And in chapter 23, we're told of kind of the last hours

578
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,540
 that Jesus lived as he was being crucified.

579
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,180
 And it says, they took him out

580
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,580
 and they put him on this hill called the hill of the skull

581
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,260
 and they crucified Jesus.

582
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,620
 And it says, they put him between these two criminals.

583
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,060
 And a criminal in that day was not someone

584
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,480
 who was crucified just for like,

585
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,600
 oh, you kind of stole some pita bread

586
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,020
 from the marketplace down the road.

587
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
 It wasn't a person who did that.

588
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,940
 A person in order to be crucified

589
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,520
 had to be a level of criminality

590
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,680
 that would be equivalent with someone

591
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,620
 who would be on death row in our civilization

592
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,820
 or in our time.

593
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,000
 But it wasn't just kind of everybody's,

594
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,540
 in fact, the word for criminal

595
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,540
 is literally a word for traitor or pirates.

596
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,220
 This person was maybe a murderer,

597
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,140
 maybe someone who had committed rape.

598
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,080
 He'd done everything wrong.

599
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,060
 And he's hanging on a cross next to the son of God

600
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,560
 who had done everything right.

601
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,080
 And in between these two criminals,

602
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,180
 all of a sudden there begins to be an exchange, a dialogue.

603
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,140
 Jesus and the two criminals beginning to talk

604
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,300
 with one another and with Jesus.

605
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,280
 And one of them begins to hurl insults at Jesus.

606
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,180
 He says, you saved other people.

607
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,860
 You allowed blind people to see you.

608
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,660
 You allowed lame people to begin to walk.

609
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,980
 You raised people from the dead

610
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,560
 and you're being crucified?

611
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
 Save yourself and save us.

612
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,940
 And it says that the other criminal looked at Jesus

613
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,140
 and looked at the other criminal and he said,

614
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,540
 don't you know what you're saying?

615
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,060
 This man, Jesus, is not deserving of death.

616
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,700
 We're here because we deserve to be.

617
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,000
 This man is innocent.

618
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,860
 And it says, the Bible, Luke tells us,

619
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,140
 the criminal then begins to ask Jesus for a favor.

620
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,540
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

621
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,140
 when you come into your kingdom?

622
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,400
 He says, Jesus, will you remember me

623
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 when you come into your kingdom?

624
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,360
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

625
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 when you come into your kingdom?

626
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,400
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

627
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

628
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

629
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

630
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

631
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

632
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

633
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

634
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

635
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

636
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

637
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

638
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

639
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

640
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

641
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

642
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

643
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

644
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

645
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

646
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

647
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

648
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

649
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

650
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

651
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

655
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

656
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

657
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

658
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

659

 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

665
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

666
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

 when you come into your kingdom?

668
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

669
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

670
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

671

 when you come into your kingdom?

676
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

677
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

678
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

679
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

680
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

681
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

682
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

683
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

684
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

685
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

686
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

687
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

688
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

689
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

690
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
 And he says, Jesus, will you remember me

691
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
 when you come into your kingdom?

692
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 And he said, someone says, I trust that you,

693
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
 Jesus, on the cross, you paid for my sin.

694
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
 You paid for everything in my past.

695
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
 Everything that, even right now,

696
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 is a part of my life.

697
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 The sin that I hate,

698
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
 or maybe that I don't even hate.

699
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 That's how broken I am.

700
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
 You paid for everything in my future

701
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 that I don't even know.

702
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 Paul says, in a moment where they put their trust,

703
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
 that Jesus, on the cross, finished it.

704
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 It's paid for.

705
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 They received the righteousness

706
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 or right standing with God.

707
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
 He continues, it gets even better.

708
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 There's no difference for all have sinned

709
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 and fall short of the glory of God

710
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
 and are justified.

711
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
 The word justified

712
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 is the same word for righteousness

713
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
 in the Greek language.

714
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
 It's the verb form of the word righteousness.

715
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 Here's what that means.

716
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 It's the word righteousified.

717
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
 Like, when we think justified,

718
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 it's kind of like a judge sitting there

719
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
 and like, you know,

720
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 you're pardoned, justified.

721
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
 The word is so much more than that.

722
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
 It's you are, in a moment where you trust

723
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
 what Jesus did on the cross,

724
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
 he paid for your sin,

725
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 God looks at you and says,

726
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
 you're righteousified.

727
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
 You have the righteousness of Christ Jesus

728
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
 imputed or passed on to you.

729
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
 That in a moment where you believe,

730
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
 it's as though he says,

731
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 you have been made declared forever

732
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 the very righteousness of Christ.

733
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 The right standing that Jesus has

734
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
 with the Father

735
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 is all of a sudden passed on to you.

736
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 This takes place

737
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
 freely, as in without cost,

738
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
 to the one who will

739
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
 accept it by his grace

740
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
 through the redemption

741
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 or the purchase that is in Christ Jesus.

742
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
 That in a moment where you trust,

743
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
 you're righteousified.

744
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 Here's further what that means.

745
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
 I think we think of righteous or justified

746
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 and we think of, oh man, a clean slate.

747
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
 That's great.

748
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
 He's given me a clean slate.

749
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 It's that, but it's so much more than that.

750
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
 That it's not just some sort of, ah,

751
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 he lived a perfect life, and I think it was pretty easy

752
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
 for him because he's God, right?

753
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 It wasn't just, hey, this perfect life is kind of

754
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 passed on to you. It's not just that,

755
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 but it is that in addition to

756
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
 what that righteousness led him to do,

757
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 which was die on the cross,

758
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
 do the most heroic thing in all of human history.

759
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
 That he would give his life

760
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
 and all the glory and all the amazing

761
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
 and all the wonder that that righteousness

762
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
 led him to do as an expression

763
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
 of what, because of that righteousness he deserves,

764
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
 all of that's passed on to you.

765
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 It's not just, hey, you're pardoned.

766
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
 It's like, hey, you get the medal of honor.

767
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
 But the righteousness

768
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
 that belongs only to Jesus,

769
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
 if you will accept it, is yours.

770
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
 And not only that,

771
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
 but he, redemption,

772
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
 purchased anyone

773
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
 who would trust in what he did on the cross.

774
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
 That's what the word redemption means,

775
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 is purchased.

776
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
 God presented him, that's Jesus,

777
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
 as a sacrifice of atonement.

778
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
 To atone is to basically stand in someone's place.

779
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
 That, hey, you deserve,

780
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
 you are

781
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
 the person who is in trouble,

782
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
 but I will stand in your place, and I'll take

783
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
 the punishment of the consequence

784
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
 that you deserve.

785
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 Through faith in his blood,

786
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
 God did this to demonstrate his justice

787
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
 because in his forbearance,

788
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
 he had left sins committed beforehand

789
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
 unpunished.

790
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
 Basically, Paul introduces

791
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
 a little bit of a complicated idea that basically,

792
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
 hey, God shows us how just he is

793
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
 because not only was Christ

794
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
 on the cross paying for the sins in the future,

795
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
 but all the sins that man had created

796
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
 ever since Adam and Eve,

797
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
 that God was holding back

798
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 the punishment, and in Jesus,

799
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 he was paying for all of them, that every sin will be paid for.

800
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,200
 He did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time

801
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
 so as to be the one who is just

802
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
 and justifies those who have faith

803
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 in Christ Jesus, that God,

804
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 unlike the idea that, hey, if you're a good person,

805
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 you get to go to heaven where you

806
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
 kind of get the glory. Let's be honest.

807
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
 I mean, it's kind of like, no, you know, not me.

808
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
 You know, I'm kind of a good person, you know.

809
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 But in the system

810
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
 that actually exists, God gets all of the glory.

811
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 He's the one who saves.

812
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
 He's the one who died in your place.

813
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
 He's the one who lived the life you could not live.

814
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
 He's the one who allows those

815
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
 who accept his gift

816
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
 to have eternal life with him,

817
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
 that God gets all of the praise,

818
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
 that all the emphasis is on him.

819
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 It brings us to our third idea

820
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
 from this text, which is only God

821
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
 can make you good. Only God can make

822
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
 us good. Only God can make us good,

823
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
 that no one will ever be able to reach heaven

824
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
 without God's help, that all of us,

825
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
 as the verse says, have fallen short of God's standard.

826
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 It's not dissimilar to this,

827
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
 'cause here's where I think we get caught.

828
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
 I think we go, man, no one is good enough,

829
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
 but there really are some good people,

830
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 and I think that they try, and they have a good heart,

831
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
 and they do good things,

832
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
 and they're not as bad as a lot of people

833
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
 that I see out there.

834
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
 The Bible presents us this idea of, like, there's just

835
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 a standard that is too high,

836
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
 that no matter how good we are, we'll never be able

837
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
 to get there, no matter how much we try.

838
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
 It'd be like this.

839
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 Let's say we had a swimming competition,

840
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
 and we're gonna have a swimming competition.

841
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
 Here's the distance you have to swim. You have to swim from New York

842
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
 to London or to Great Britain.

843
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
 All of a sudden,

844
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 we may have swimmers inside of the room that are like,

845
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
 "Oh, man, yeah, I think I could do it. I swam in high school,

846
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
 and I'll be great." And then there's other people,

847
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
 and no matter who you have, like, you know,

848
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
 I may make it one mile. You may make it five.

849
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 Michael Phelps may make it 50,

850
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
 but nobody's making it to London

851
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
 or Great Britain.

852
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
 That everyone will fall short,

853
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
 that the standard is just

854
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
 an impossible thing to meet.

855
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 And the Scriptures tell us

856
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
 that everyone, no matter how good

857
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
 that we think that they are, has fallen short

858
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 of God's standard. But what does God do?

859
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
 Does He just say, "Man, these guys are pathetic.

860
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
 They can't even swim more than 50 miles.

861
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
 It's unbelievable." What does He do? Does He look down

862
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 at humanity and say, "Man, they just can't be good enough.

863
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 I'm done with those people"? No.

864
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
 He displays His goodness

865
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 by moving towards

866
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
 the badness of humanity

867
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
 and running after

868
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
 the human race

869
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
 that had rebelled against Him, that had

870
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
 run from Him, that doesn't even think

871
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 a lot of times, for the majority, that they need Him.

872
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
 And what does He do?

873
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
 What does the heart of God do?

874
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
 It goes and takes on a cross and

875
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 dies in their place?

876
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
 Inside of the goodness

877
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
 of God, we don't find some system of like,

878
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
 "We're trying to reach up and we just can't get there."

879
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
 We find a God who's reaching down

880
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
 and saying,

881
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
 "Cling on to Me. Will you trust in Me?

882
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
 And what I did on the cross,

883
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
 if you think that

884
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
 you're a good enough person to go to heaven,

885
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
 you're arrogant."

886
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 I used to think that that was like,

887
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 it was kind of humble to be like, "Yeah,

888
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
 I'm trying to be good.

889
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
 Will I go to heaven? I don't know.

890
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
 I guess we'll see. I'm trying to do the best that I can."

891
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
 I used to think, "Man, that's pretty humble."

892
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
 And then one day I realized,

893
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
 "That's arrogant."

894
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
 Because it assumes

895
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
 that I could actually

896
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
 be good enough,

897
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
 if I try hard enough and I'm disciplined

898
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
 enough, that I could actually be good

899
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
 enough to earn my right

900
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
 into heaven.

901
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
 And God says, "That arrogance

902
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
 will keep you out of heaven

903
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
 and send you to hell." It is the pride

904
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
 that sent Satan out of heaven.

905
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
 The pride that sent our parent,

906
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
 or Adam and Eve, out of Eden.

907
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
 And it is the most

908
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
 deadly force moving through our country right now

909
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
 where most people, and so many of you inside

910
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
 of this room,

911
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
 you think that you're a good person.

912
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
 Or you think that if you are,

913
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
 you're able to be a good person,

914
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 that God will accept you. That's arrogant.

915
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
 And you're arrogant.

916
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
 And he will not accept you on that basis.

917
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
 There is only

918
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
 one way to have eternal life.

919
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
 And that's by

920
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
 accepting the perfect

921
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
 sacrifice that was made for you and for me

922
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
 by Jesus and his death

923
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
 on the cross, in our place.

924
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,200
 I think there's something

925
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 skeptical about us, and maybe

926
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
 it's just human nature, where it's hard to...

927
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
 The idea that, like, "Hey, it's a free gift.

928
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
 Just accept it. You don't have to do

929
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
 anything to earn it." Christianity, unlike every other

930
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
 world religion, you can guarantee yourself

931
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
 heaven in your chair right now.

932
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 Think about that.

933
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 Just by accepting the free gift.

934
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 And I think we're all skeptical of, like,

935
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 "Free, it's too good to be true."

936
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
 I don't know if I can accept that. Like, in general,

937
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
 we're just skeptical of anything that's

938
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
 free. When people tell us, "Hey, this is

939
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
 a free opportunity, a free trip,

940
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
 or a free credit card,"

941
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
 we're all just kind of a little bit skeptical. In fact,

942
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
 one day, not long ago, if you were with us a couple

943
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
 years ago, you remember when we went, we bought an

944
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
 iPad, because we believed this was true. We bought

945
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
 an iPad. We went to North Park Mall, which is a mall

946
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
 here in Dallas, and we just went to go see.

947
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
 "Hey, if we put a sign that says, 'Ask me,'

948
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
 or, 'If you want a free iPad, ask me,'

949
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
 for one."

950
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
 And we went out there, and we stood in North Park Mall,

951
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 and literally, we made a video of it. We're not gonna

952
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
 show it, but inside of that

953
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
 time where we just stood there with a sign

954
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
 saying, "Ask me about a free iPad,"

955
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 not a single person asked.

956
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
 I mean, literally,

957
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
 the next day at the porch, we were like, "We have an iPad.

958
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
 We're just gonna give it away to somebody." And

959
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
 true story, it happened. But no one asked, because

960
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
 we're kind of all skeptical. In the same way, when it comes

961
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
 to the gospel, there's part

962
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
 of human religion

963
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 and a lot of our thinking

964
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
 that's an obstacle that you, if you ever

965
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
 are gonna experience eternal life, will have to

966
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
 get over. That if you access

967
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
 heaven, it will not be because you earn

968
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
 it or you deserve it,

969
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
 but because God freely

970
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
 gives to anyone

971
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
 who will accept it, anyone who will just

972
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
 trust that He paid

973
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
 for their sin on the cross, that they

974
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
 cannot, they'll take their trust off themselves.

975
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
 "I can't be a good enough person.

976
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
 I'll never be

977
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
 there, but I'm accepting that

978
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
 you died in my place on the cross

979
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
 for me." He says, "Anyone who

980
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
 accepts that is forever

981
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
 righteousified."

982
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
 Stands with the perfect righteousness

983
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
 of Jesus, forever

984
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
 theirs, despite every,

985
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
 despite the abortion in your past,

986
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
 despite

987
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
 the ways that, like, man,

988
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 you just dishonored God

989
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
 you know that you have with your body.

990
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
 Despite the times you've looked

991
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
 at pornography, despite

992
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
 the times you've stuck a finger down your throat, despite

993
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
 the times that you just, like,

994
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
 are riddled with anxiety

995
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
 and you really don't trust God,

996
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
 despite all of those things that He looks

997
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
 at you and says, "You are

998
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
 the righteousness of God

999
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
 in Christ Jesus."

1000
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
 As righteous as Jesus,

1001
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
 the Lamb who was slain,

1002
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
 are you

1003
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
 if you've accepted that, despite

1004
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
 all of your baggage, despite everything that you've

1005
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
 done wrong, despite everything that I've done wrong,

1006
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
 that in the midst

1007
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
 of, we're just broken sinners.

1008
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
 And if you're here for the first time back

1009
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
 in church, I hope that you hear, if nothing else,

1010
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
 you have come into a place

1011
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
 that is

1012
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
 full of really broken, messed up, sinful people.

1013
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
 And we're all finding healing

1014
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
 and hope in Christ, and we're all

1015
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
 waiting to be taken home.

1016
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
 But there's no perfect pastor up here.

1017
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
 The guy on the stage is probably just

1018
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
 not even probably, is just

1019
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
 if not more messed up than everybody out there.

1020
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
 And the people around you are just as

1021
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
 messed up as the person of you.

1022
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
 As we've said before here, like, if you

1023
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
 knew everything that I thought or did,

1024
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
 you would not listen to me preach.

1025
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
 And if we knew everything that you thought

1026
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
 or did, we would not let you in here.

1027
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
 And, uh,

1028
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
 and you're just surrounded by people

1029
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
 who are not

1030
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
 perfect.

1031
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
 But they have found

1032
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
 a perfect Savior.

1033
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
 And we don't think we're better than

1034
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
 you, we think we're better off

1035
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
 than we used to be.

1036
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
 Because we have found the only way

1037
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
 to eternal life. You know where the religion work?

1038
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
 You know where the religion

1039
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
 paints the picture of this God who is love,

1040
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
 who comes in, who died

1041
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
 in our place.

1042
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
 I'll

1043
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
 close here and land the plane. I, uh,

1044
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
 the reality

1045
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
 of good people going to heaven, or the lie,

1046
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
 is bad advice.

1047
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
 Good people don't go to heaven. Forgiving

1048
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
 people go to heaven. And the only way to get

1049
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
 forgiveness is by putting your faith

1050
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
 or your trust in Jesus

1051
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
 and what he did on the cross. I remember

1052
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
 this whole message, honestly, this week,

1053
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
 reminded me of a conversation

1054
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
 that I had when I was in 10th grade,

1055
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
 years and years ago,

1056
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
 with a guy, I was a believer at the time,

1057
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
 and I remember I was in IPC.

1058
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
 You know, remember IPC, Integrated Physics

1059
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
 and Chemistry class? So we're in there, I don't know

1060
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
 if we're dissecting frogs, I don't know

1061
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
 what we're doing inside of that class.

1062
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
 Clearly didn't pay attention well enough. But,

1063
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
 we're in that class and I had this friend whose name was Austin,

1064
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
 he was Jewish, he was sitting next to me, I was a believer,

1065
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
 I was Christian, and I remember just talking to him about

1066
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
 faith all the time. And one day he hit

1067
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
 me and he was like, "Dude, so what you're telling me

1068
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
 is that if you are

1069
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
 a Christian, no matter what

1070
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
 you do, if you've put your faith in Jesus

1071
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
 like you believe he paid for your sin

1072
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
 on the cross, he died in your place, that

1073
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
 God came down

1074
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
 as a man in Christ and he died for your

1075
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
 sin and he rose from the dead, and if you believe

1076
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
 that, then you spend eternity

1077
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
 with God, regardless of what you've done on this planet."

1078
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
 And I said, "Yes."

1079
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
 And if you don't believe that, regardless of

1080
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
 what you've done on this planet, then you spend eternity

1081
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
 away from God or in hell.

1082
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
 And I said, "Yes."

1083
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
 And he said, "Wait a second, so you're telling me that if Gandhi,

1084
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
 Gandhi, I mean Gandhi was a great guy,

1085
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
 Gandhi, remember he was the guy who like, I sleep with

1086
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
 virgins just to show how disciplined

1087
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
 that I am right now. Gandhi was the guy who did nothing

1088
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
 wrong, I mean he's such a good guy, he's a guy all

1089
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
 about peace. You're telling me that Gandhi, who never

1090
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
 as far as we know, trusted in Jesus,

1091
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
 if Gandhi never trusted in Jesus, that Gandhi

1092
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
 would spend eternity with hell, or

1093
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
 in hell? But if

1094
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
 Hitler, at the end of his

1095
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
 life, came to this place where he was like,

1096
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
 "Man, I act, I repent of what I've done, I'm,

1097
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
 I can't believe what I've done. God,

1098
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
 I'm begging you, I ask that you would forgive

1099
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
 me. I'm trusting not in what I've done, or

1100
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
 what I haven't done, but in what you did on the cross

1101
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
 dying in my place, that Hitler

1102
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
 would go to heaven?"

1103
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
 And I said,

1104
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
 "Yes, that's what I'm saying."

1105
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
 He said, "That's just so messed up."

1106
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
 And we began to dialogue, we began to talk

1107
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
 about, you know why that is? Because maybe inside of your room you're like,

1108
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
 "Ew, I don't know if I know that. I don't know if I,

1109
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
 I'm a little uncomfortable with that."

1110
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
 Here's what the Bible teaches.

1111
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
 From Gandhi

1112
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
 to Hitler to Mother Teresa to you in your chair

1113
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
 right now, you've all, and myself included,

1114
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
 sinned against

1115
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
 an eternal being, an eternal God,

1116
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
 a God who is holy

1117
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
 and perfect, and the punishment

1118
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
 for that sin

1119
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
 is eternal death.

1120
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
 And you may be going, "Man, it's a little

1121
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
 extreme, you know, like, we did just

1122
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
 a couple bad things, boys will be boys, really?

1123
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
 Eternal death?"

1124
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
 I mean, we understand that the

1125
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
 higher a person's status is,

1126
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
 the higher an offense against them, the

1127
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
 consequence will be. In other words, like, if you trespass

1128
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
 on my lawn, there's not really gonna be anything

1129
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
 that happens to you. If you trespass on the

1130
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
 president's lawn, you get shot.

1131
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
 And an offense

1132
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
 against God Almighty,

1133
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
 the wages of that sin

1134
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
 is death, eternal

1135
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
 death.

1136
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
 And Hitler

1137
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
 has sinned against God by will, by

1138
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
 birth, and by choice. Gandhi has

1139
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
 sinned against God.

1140
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
 You have sinned against God.

1141
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
 And there's an eternal death sentence.

1142
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
 And that

1143
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
 death sentence will only be paid, or an eternal debt

1144
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
 must be paid or will be paid in one of two

1145
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
 ways. Either a person

1146
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
 will reject Christ

1147
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
 or just spend their whole life thinking, "I can earn my

1148
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
 way to God," and they will

1149
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
 spend eternity

1150
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
 paying for the offense of sinning

1151
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
 against a perfect God,

1152
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
 where they will have eternal

1153
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
 death for all of eternity, or

1154
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
 they will accept

1155
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
 the eternal

1156
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
 death

1157
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
 of Christ,

1158
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
 an eternal God

1159
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
 who became a man

1160
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
 and died. Either they will pay for

1161
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
 eternity, what Christ,

1162
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
 being an eternal God, did in a

1163
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
 moment by dying in their place,

1164
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
 or

1165
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
 they will trust in Jesus

1166
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
 and spend eternity with God forever in heaven.

1167
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
 That's what the Bible teaches.

1168
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
 That's why Hitler and Gandhi, they've all

1169
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
 fallen short. We think there's

1170
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
 such a huge gap. The gap isn't between

1171
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
 Hitler and Gandhi. It's between humanity

1172
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
 and God. But God made a way. He

1173
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
 bridged the gap

1174
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
 for anyone who would trust in Him.

1175
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
 He's paid for that sin. He hasn't

1176
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
 made it so, like, you have to climb and work your

1177
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
 way to Him. Why

1178
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
 would God even allow sin into this

1179
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
 world? Why would He allow that to happen? God didn't

1180
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
 create the world with sin.

1181
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
 Man introduced

1182
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
 sin into the world. God created the

1183
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
 world perfect, and He will restore

1184
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
 it. And every

1185
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
 sin that's been created or committed

1186
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
 will be paid for, either by the person

1187
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
 who committed it, or was paid for

1188
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
 on the cross.

1189
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
 And the offer to all humanity

1190
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
 is extended.

1191
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
 That your sin has been paid for.

1192
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
 Why would God even

1193
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
 allow Adam and Eve, maybe you think,

1194
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
 maybe you've wondered, why would He even allow

1195
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
 Adam and Eve the chance

1196
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
 to be disobedient? Like, why would you put the tree

1197
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
 there? Just get rid of the tree.

1198
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
 Because God

1199
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
 created an environment that could allow

1200
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
 them to have the thing

1201
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
 that without free will you can't have.

1202
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
 A relationship.

1203
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,200
 Trust.

1204
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
 Love.

1205
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,200
 That He created an environment that allowed,

1206
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
 man, hey, I don't want to just have

1207
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
 robots. I want to have a place where

1208
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
 there's a relationship with one another.

1209
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200
 Well, that was a pretty crazy

1210
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
 and stupid thing that He would do, because now there's

1211
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
 going to have tons of people going to hell. "I died in

1212
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
 their place!"

1213
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
 Is that some God who's distant off in this

1214
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
 distant land, doesn't care about humanity?

1215
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
 That He came down and died on a cross

1216
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
 made of wood that He created from a tree

1217
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
 that He gave life to by humans

1218
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
 that He formed in their mother's womb?

1219
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
 That the

1220
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
 same humanity that He loved, mocked

1221
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
 and spit on Him,

1222
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
 killed and crucified Him?

1223
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
 The same humanity that He was

1224
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
 on the planet to pay for their sin?

1225
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
 The same humanity

1226
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
 that's in this room?

1227
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
 The same humanity that's on this

1228
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
 stage? That whatever your

1229
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
 conception about God, whatever your

1230
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
 conception about the God the Bible presents is not like

1231
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
 any other God out there. He's the only

1232
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
 one who is there. And there is no religious

1233
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
 system that even comes close.

1234
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
 There's not a reference to Allah

1235
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
 being a love.

1236
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
 There's no stories of any other gods

1237
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
 who take on human flesh and die for mankind.

1238
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
 This is a

1239
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
 love that's beyond any other understanding

1240
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
 of any other religious system, any other

1241
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
 love the world has ever seen. God is not some

1242
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
 distant force that doesn't care.

1243
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
 What sort of a

1244
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
 God would take on human flesh and die for you?

1245
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
 Whatever you believe

1246
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
 about God, you cannot actually believe

1247
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
 that, that He doesn't care.

1248
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,200
 He cares enough to die in your place

1249
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
 because you can't

1250
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
 be a good enough person. And if you think

1251
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
 you can, you're arrogant. And may

1252
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
 God have mercy on you and show you

1253
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
 that you will spend eternity in hell

1254
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
 if you do not trust, not in

1255
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
 what you do, not in how good of a person

1256
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
 you are, not despite the bad things

1257
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
 that you've done, not the fact that you had an abortion

1258
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
 and I'm scared that maybe God won't, but in

1259
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
 Jesus and what

1260
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
 He did on the cross,

1261
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
 there is only one

1262
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,200
 way.

1263
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
 And those who will spend

1264
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
 eternity with God in heaven will not be

1265
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,200
 good people.

1266
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,200
 They will be forgiven

1267
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,200
 people. And the God who is there,

1268
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
 man, Lord,

1269
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
 is so amazing and

1270
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
 extravagant in His love that He has

1271
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,200
 stretched out His hands to die on a cross.

1272
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,200
 I'm going to close. I'm landing the plane. I'm landing it right now.

1273
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
 A love that for all of

1274
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
 eternity, those who trust in Him will worship

1275
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
 and see displayed on full form.

1276
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
 And the

1277
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
 offer extends to anyone inside of this room.

1278
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
 If you've never trusted in what Christ did,

1279
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
 tonight is your night.

1280
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
 And if you have, here's what I know.

1281
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
 Here's why this message is so applicable.

1282
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
 Because you

1283
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
 live and move and have

1284
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
 your being around people

1285
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
 at your job, in your apartment,

1286
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
 next door in your house,

1287
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
 in your family.

1288
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
 They've bought the lie.

1289
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
 They've bought the lie that good people go to

1290
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
 heaven. Doesn't even make sense.

1291
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
 But the greatest lie that Satan has sold,

1292
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
 at least our country,

1293
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
 is that if you're

1294
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
 good,

1295
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
 God will love you.

1296
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
 But you're not good,

1297
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
 and God does love you enough

1298
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
 to die for you. If you'll accept

1299
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
 what He's done, you'll spend eternity

1300
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
 for heaven and everything. We pray that we would.

1301
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
 Father, thank You.

1302
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
 Man, Lord.

1303
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
 Thank You feels like

1304
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,200
 I don't even think it feels

1305
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
 stupid and foolish to even say thank You

1306
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
 for dying an eternal death

1307
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,200
 in my place.

1308
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
 The full extent of

1309
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
 a sacrifice like that, I don't even

1310
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,200
 have the ability to

1311
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
 understand.

1312
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
 But I can't walk away

1313
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
 and think.

1314
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,200
 That You're not crazy

1315
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
 in love with humanity

1316
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
 despite all of our flaws.

1317
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
 Father, I pray for just

1318
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
 friends inside of this room that every single

1319
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
 week come and they don't have a confidence

1320
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
 they'll spend eternity with God

1321
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
 because they haven't put their

1322
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
 faith in what You did on the cross in their place.

1323
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
 That tonight would be their night, Lord.

1324
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
 Would You stretch out Your hand,

1325
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
 open eyes, do what only You can do

1326
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
 which is allow them

1327
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200
 to put their faith

1328
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,200
 off of themselves, to put their trust,

1329
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
 put their confidence

1330
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,200
 and take it off of what

1331
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,200
 they've done or what they haven't done or what they

1332
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
 did and

1333
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
 put it on You.

1334
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
 Put it on what You've done. It's finished.

1335
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
 And when they do, they will become

1336
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
 the righteousness of Christ,

1337
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
 the righteousness of God.

1338
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
 They will be righteous-ified

1339
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
 forever, Lord.

1340
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
 Father, we worship You. We thank You

1341
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
 that You spilt Your blood.

1342
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
 You died for us. May that never

1343
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
 grow cold in our hearts.

1344
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,200
 We worship You in song. Amen.

1345
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:37,200
