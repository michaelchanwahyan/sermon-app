[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   I mean, he's practically dating a model.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.680]   She told me they went to Cabo and he paid for the whole thing.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.220]   Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.200]   He proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.400]   Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.040]   She's got the husband, the house, she's got it all.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.840]   What more could you ask for?
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.320]   What more could you ask for?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.680]   Hey, isn't worship, great worship, a gift?
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.960]   I know Fort Worth and Houston, you just worshipped as well.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   It is a gift.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.640]   Can we just applaud our bands, whoever just led us, wherever you're at.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.800]   Thank you for using your gifts to, it's like you're looking, you came in, you're distracted
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.780]   and you're looking through this lens that's out of focus and great worship through song
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.840]   and music just focuses our hearts for what we're about to hear as we move through this
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560]   series relationship goals.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.200]   And so great to be with you.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.760]   Great to have been with you in Sky Ranch and to return back here with you now.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.000]   And so I want to start with a buying experience I've recently had.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.300]   I went shopping for sunglasses, actually bought two pair of sunglasses for two different reasons
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.660]   and had two very different purchasing experiences.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.280]   Have you guys ever gone and bought sunglasses before or glasses of any sort before?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.580]   I see lots of them, so I know you have, unless you stole them.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.220]   I hope you didn't.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.720]   So I go out, so the first kind, the first week, Monica and I were in Mexico and I forgot
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.760]   my sunglasses and I kind of didn't even realize that I forgot my sunglasses.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.720]   We're out there and we went shopping one day in Mexico, like, you know, to a mall in Cancun
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.840]   and we're walking through the mall and I'm like, oh, I forgot my sunglasses.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.640]   I think I should get some.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.040]   And I didn't really know what I was looking for.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520]   And so I put on some aviators and I'm like, Hey, what do you think?
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.100]   She's like, nah, too top gun.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100]   And so I put on some wayfares.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   I'm like, what do you think?
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.260]   She's like, nah, too Ferris Bueller day off and or last summer.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.160]   And so, and so I kept trying on different pairs, you know, what do you think?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.720]   How do they, how do these make me feel?
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.040]   You know, who, what is the identity that I'm putting on with these and kind of just different
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   trying on different kinds.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.160]   I must've tried on like a hundred pair of sunglasses before coming to one and then constantly
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.560]   second guessing that decision.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.240]   And uh, and so, Oh well.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.400]   And so the second time I purchased a pair in the past couple of weeks was actually for
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   my friend Shane E. So his car got broken into and I was over at his house and his car got
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.280]   broken into that night.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.480]   And, um, and he's like, man, they stole my sunglasses.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   I'm like, I'm sorry, bro.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   I was like, Hey, I'd love to get you a new pair, you know?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.480]   And uh, and so I'm like, what were they?
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   And he's like, well, they were some Ray bans.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   I was like, well, what, what were they?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.320]   And he's like, they were a model number RB 8301 size 56.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm like, these things come in sizes.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.960]   And uh, and he's like, yeah, size 56.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   That's what they were.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   I'm like, well, I'm glad you know.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   Okay.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.240]   So I'm going, so, so we, we, Monica and I are on a double date with some friends and
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   we find ourselves out.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.440]   And so I go, I'm looking for the sun.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.240]   I'm like, Hey, I've got to find shady, some sunglasses.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.100]   Do you guys mind if we, if we go, and so I'm walking into sunglass hut and sunglass Island
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.720]   and sunglass are us and, and trying to find these.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   And, and so now I know exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   Right.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.680]   And it's, I'm like, Hey, do you have RB 8301 size 56?
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.000]   And they're like, Oh, come here, sir.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.560]   You know, here's our selection of Ray-Bans.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.160]   You know, these I think would look great on you.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   You don't understand.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.040]   I'm looking for RB 8301 size 56.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   Do you have those?
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   Cause if you don't have those, I'm wasting my time.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.200]   You're wasting my time.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.680]   8301 size 56.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.000]   I'm sorry, sir.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We don't have that.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Okay.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Thanks.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Onto the next store.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.400]   Hey, do you have RB 8301 size 56?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.200]   Uh, sir, let me look.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.480]   Oh, you know what?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   Here's the Ray-Ban section.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.840]   I think these Maui gems would look good.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   No, no, no.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   You don't understand.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   Mr. Salesperson.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.920]   I'm looking for RB 8301 size 56.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.820]   They're like size 56.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.400]   They come standard in size 59.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.040]   I know my friend has a tiny head.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   Okay.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.600]   I need size 56.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.120]   I'm like, don't let that distract you from worship later, but I'm looking for size 56.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.240]   And so like, I'm sorry, sir.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   I don't have those.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.960]   And so we go one to the next to the next, because here's the deal.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.560]   These guys are trained professionals.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.200]   It is their occupation to sell me a pair of sunglasses.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.840]   But if they don't have what, see the way that I overcome their sales brainwashing is I know
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.400]   There's, there's two kinds of shopping.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.720]   You guys know this.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.240]   You, you have been to the mall where you know exactly what you're looking for.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.400]   We'll call you the focused shopper.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.460]   You're the focus shopper.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.460]   You're going in.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.460]   You're like me.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   Hey, do you have this?
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460]   If you don't, you're wasting my time.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.780]   And then there's the impulsive buyer.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.260]   This is where you have a little bit of money, a little bit of time, and you're looking to
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.060]   feel better.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.480]   So you go to the mall and you find yourself looking at purses, you know, because your
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.960]   old purse is well, not the one you're looking at.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.040]   You know, you got no reason, you know, until you, you're looking at buying a bag so you
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.400]   can put your 26 other bags inside of it.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.780]   You're like, well, this Mark Jacob or, you know, Tory Burch or long champ or whatever,
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.780]   you know, I don't know.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.780]   Let me just try these out.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.900]   Or, or you're just, you find yourself in Brookstone, you know, looking at some weird remote control
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.980]   helicopter that works for your iPad only because you have money in time and you're going to
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.460]   get sold because you don't know what you're looking for.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.300]   And some of us date that way.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.980]   We don't know what we're looking for.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.020]   And so we're just waiting for this feeling to come to us.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   And somebody told us, well, you just know when you know.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.440]   And so you're going through life waiting till you just know, when does this feeling kind
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.340]   of come up on me so that I can identify the person that I'm going to spend the rest of
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.340]   my life with?
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.000]   And that's foolish.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.920]   Start with standards.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.980]   And so tonight, as we move through relationship goals, we're talking about identifying the
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.980]   one, whether you are on the date or trying to find the person that you're going to date.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.980]   I want to give you from the scriptures, some criteria so that you can know what you are
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:52.380]   looking for so that you can identify the one.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.860]   And when I say the one, I just want to clear up some misunderstandings.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.220]   Say maybe you came in here and you thought that there is one person out there that you're
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.660]   looking for and you've got to find them like a needle in a haystack.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.940]   No.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.540]   If you're a follower of Jesus Christ and you're listening to this message right now, there's
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.160]   a group of people that you can select from, probably hundreds of thousands of people that
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.740]   you could spend the rest of your life with and fulfill God's will for you.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.140]   I always hit that home in this way.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.100]   My wife and I have been married for 12 years now.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.180]   And I always say, do you think that I am the best one for her?
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.140]   Now I'm six feet, seven inches tall.
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.220]   She's five three.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.860]   We're very different beings.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.180]   If God made her specifically for me and me only for her, then he just has a sense of
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.020]   humor that he would put us together.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.780]   Is there someone out there better for Monica than me?
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.780]   Absolutely.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.780]   Problem.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.380]   Some of you, I just heard mind blown.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:09.820]   Yes, yes, there are men out there better for her, better suited for her, more compatible
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.780]   for her than me.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.240]   But we married each other.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.700]   And so we belong to each other for the rest of this life.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.380]   We're not searching for anybody else.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.100]   We don't need to find anyone else.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   Right?
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.380]   If you believe in this idea of the one, then when marriage gets tough, you're going to
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.260]   think, oh, I married the wrong one.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.360]   That's what about half of you will do.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.220]   That's what I want to save you from tonight.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.220]   One of many things I want to save you from tonight.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.060]   And so if you're a follower of Christ, there's this relatively small group of people that
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:50.780]   you can look in to try and find the one out of many that could be the one.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.300]   So tonight we're identifying the one I'm going to be in first Timothy chapter four.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.980]   If you want to turn there, we're going to look at one verse tonight.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.260]   We'll look at several verses, but I'm going to move through slowly through one verse.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.180]   As we talk about five things that scripture identifies that would make a great list.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.920]   Let me give you this disclaimer.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.980]   This is not a dating verse.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.980]   Okay.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.260]   This is the apostle Paul talking to Timothy saying, Hey, if they try to look down on you,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.100]   set an example in these five character traits.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.220]   But as I think about biblical character traits that I could give you to for a husband or
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.420]   a wife, I cannot put together a better list than the apostle Paul or the Holy spirit through
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.980]   the apostle Paul already put together here in first Timothy four.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.500]   I have zero problem with you writing down this list and leaving with it and using it
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:51.900]   as a checklist in a dating relationship or as you consider one, you got to have standards.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.660]   And let me say this in love.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.020]   If your standards are not God's standards, then your standards are stupid.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.540]   And I mean that as lovingly as I possibly can.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.380]   If you are out there and you're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:14.100]   and you haven't considered God's standards for you, what are you doing?
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.980]   If your standards are not God's standards, then your standards are stupid.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.420]   First Timothy four 12.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.100]   Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.440]   Hey, newsflash.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.940]   If you're in this room or you're listening to this message, most likely you are an adult.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.300]   You can buy cigarettes and vote and everything.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.980]   And so I don't know when this happened.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.380]   Somehow it just happened to you.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.940]   You woke up one day and he was like, I'm a grownup time to do grownup things.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.940]   Okay.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.980]   And so he's like, don't let anyone look down on you because you're young, but don't stick
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980]   out your chest.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.340]   I'm like, yeah, don't look down on me cause I'm young.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:57.980]   He's going to tell you how, here's how you don't set an example for the other believers.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.140]   Paul tells Timothy and he gives us five things in the, in the way you talk and speech and
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:12.280]   the way you act in conduct and the way you love in faith and in purity.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.700]   And as I think about what you're looking for in someone that you might spend the rest of
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.900]   your life with, I can't come up with a better list than this.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.100]   This is a gift to young adults who want to get married this verse.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.060]   And so the first one, he says, what did they say?
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.060]   This is the question.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.100]   It's going to be five questions.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   What did they say?
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   He says, set it.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.620]   Super negative.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.160]   Are they constantly critical or do they encourage you?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.860]   What comes out of their mouth, both to you and to others?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.000]   You don't have to be dating to observe this as you hang out and you run in circles.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.960]   You can listen to what people say.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.540]   What did they say?
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:12:01.520]   Did they show their ignorance and lack of vocabulary by constantly using profanity?
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.940]   Are they quick to get angry?
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.860]   Are they harsh?
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.600]   James one 19 says, be quick to listen and slow to speak and slow to become angry for
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.120]   man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.300]   Did they have the righteous life that God desires for them or are they quick temper?
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.220]   That's not going to make a good husband.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.580]   Oh, he just has a bad temper.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   Cool.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.900]   He's a bad husband.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.100]   Okay.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   That's not cool.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:39.000]   I was at a restaurant once and this woman was there wearing this shirt and it said,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.800]   you call me a B like it's a bad thing, but said the word, you know, and I'm sitting there
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.160]   thinking, man, I think it's a bad thing.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.060]   And I wanted to go tell her, but I was scared of her.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.740]   Cause I'm like, man, maybe, you know, anybody who wears that shirt, you know, right.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.620]   Who's who knows what's going to happen.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.620]   Right.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.420]   But it's not cool to be feisty or sassy or have attitude.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.580]   Like if you found identity in that, you found identity in something different than the spirit
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.420]   of God.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.420]   Why would you do that?
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.420]   That's not who you are.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.540]   Cause it's not who Christ is.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.820]   Just be careful if you're like, oh man, don't mess with me.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.740]   Nobody will.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.380]   Nobody.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   Why does this matter?
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.060]   It feels like tips and tricks.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.900]   I think this is first on the list.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.480]   And I think it's unbelievably important because Jesus says, because as you're thinking about
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.580]   spending the rest of your life with someone, you want to know what's in their heart.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:52.420]   And let's be honest, you can't just kind of walk up and, you know, somehow look inside
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.320]   their heart.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.780]   You can't see what's in their soul, but Jesus says you actually can.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.220]   He says, pay close attention to what comes out of their mouth.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.500]   This is the number one way to tell what's in somebody's heart.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.140]   He says this in Luke chapter six, verse 45, a good man brings good things out of the good
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.220]   stored up in his heart.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.980]   And an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for the mouth
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.320]   speaks what the heart is full of.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.860]   You want to know what some, what is in someone's heart.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.160]   You look carefully, listen carefully to what comes out of their mouth.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.660]   Are they a gossip?
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.980]   Are they constantly talking about people instead of two people?
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.140]   Are they a, did you hear person?
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.140]   You know this?
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.140]   Did you, did you hear about self?
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.140]   Oh, did you hear?
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.140]   She, did you hear?
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.140]   Hey, did you hear this?
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.140]   Did you hear that?
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:48.380]   Oh man, did you hear, are they a, did you hear person?
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.340]   Or can I tell you what I told them person?
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.660]   Cause I don't talk about people.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:59.020]   I talk to people what's coming out of their mouth.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:06.740]   Man, can I just tell you like sometimes ministry is hard.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   You're listening to people's problems and, and you're talking to people all the time
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.660]   and like sometimes it's really difficult.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:19.820]   And sometimes I just whiff, like sometimes I just miss it.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.980]   Sometimes I get angry.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.300]   Sometimes I'm impatient, man.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.100]   Sometimes I didn't have time to like work on a message and I feel like I phoned it in
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.740]   and I get down and say, Oh, I'm just kind of beat myself up.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.780]   I can tell you what a blessing it is to go home to a cheerleader.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.460]   I married a cheerleader y'all.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.820]   And she comes aside and she doesn't, she's never like, Oh babe, what do you want?
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.980]   You need more time to prepare.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.300]   Hey, you shouldn't have said this.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   Hey, you gotta be patient.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.340]   She's like, Oh sweetie, come here.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340]   Talk to me about it.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.740]   Hey, let me remind you who you are to God.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.140]   Can I remind you how he loves you?
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.740]   Can I remind you what he sees in you?
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.500]   Man, that is a blessing y'all.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:03.940]   Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader because the Proverbs tell us it's better to
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.300]   be on the corner of a roof than with the contentious wife.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.860]   Better to be, it's like a dripping faucet.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.820]   It says it's like it's Chinese water torture to be with a contentious wife.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.420]   Like you don't want the woman who's who wears the shirt.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.120]   You call me a B like it's a bad thing.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.780]   You don't want that.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.840]   You don't want the guy who misses the free throw and throws the basketball out the window.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:33.980]   You don't want that along with curse words and whatnot.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.420]   I always ask my kids, do you speak, are you speaking words that build up?
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.260]   You want someone who speaks words that build up, that encourage, that help everybody who
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.500]   hear them.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.980]   Man, that is a blessing to the rest of your life y'all.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.420]   And so the second thing is what are they known for?
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.740]   The second question on the list, what are they known for?
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.620]   It says they set an example in conduct.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.780]   The word is the way they act or your, your version may actually say in their life, what
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   is their reputation?
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.780]   What are they known for?
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.500]   Proverbs chapter 20 verse 11 says, even small children are known by their actions.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.660]   So is their conduct really pure and upright?
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:18.460]   We should inspect it even from when they're little, they are known, they have a reputation
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.380]   by what they do.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.960]   And so this is really the essence of dating, right?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.820]   We're trying to figure out, are they someone we want to marry?
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.540]   And so really, as we spend time with them, we're looking at the way they act.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.380]   And in fact, really the rest of this list fits under this conduct banner.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.380]   How did they act?
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.780]   He's going to give us some other things to inspect, but really it fits under this.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:48.420]   Hey, how did they act as you choose from this very relatively small group of people?
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.060]   And if they love Jesus, you can clearly see this in their life.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.200]   And so if you're hanging around with people and you're like, man, I don't know anybody
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.540]   who loves Jesus like that.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.060]   Can I just tell you you're hanging in the wrong circles?
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.660]   Paul actually says in Philippians two, that these kinds of people stand out like stars
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:14.460]   in a dark night, that you can't miss them because in contrast to culture, in contrast
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.220]   to our world, they shine brightly.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.900]   And if you're like, man, I don't know anyone like that.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.540]   And you may be hanging out in the wrong places.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.180]   And so we date to observe and we're not trying to find out if we're compatible.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.620]   Can I just give you this newsflash?
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.520]   Like a female center and a male center are incompatible centers.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   They're not compatible.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520]   Okay.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.620]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.460]   You're going to conflict.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.820]   You're going to argue.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.260]   You're not going to get along.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   And so really you're, you're relying on that commitment, that covenant that you made to
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.500]   work through that.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.340]   You're not trying to find someone compatible with you.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.860]   You're trying to find someone fully yielded to Christ in the way that they live their
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.860]   life.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.980]   And if you're fully yielded to Christ and they're fully yielded to Christ, you don't
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.100]   have to pursue each other.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.060]   You're pursuing God together and therefore growing closer and closer and closer and closer
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   every day.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.580]   This concept changed my marriage and my dating relationship.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.860]   In fact, it pushed me to marriage because I realized, Hey, I was dating someone at the
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.940]   time who was fully yielded to Christ.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.380]   I said, well, what am I doing then?
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.260]   I'm wasting my time dating her.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.380]   Put a ring on it.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.960]   And so let me tell you that last week, you know, we talked about baggage and for those
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.580]   of you who are here, who, who have never married, I would tell you, there is nothing that you've
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.780]   done that has disqualified you from marriage.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   Nothing.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.860]   Okay.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.940]   And so if you left last week feeling condemned or guilty or like this isn't for you, no,
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.780]   there's nothing that you've done that has disqualified you from marriage, but be faithful
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:10.260]   and heal from that baggage and you can pursue marriage, but consider their reputation and
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.980]   listen to people, right?
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.260]   Listen to people.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:24.780]   There was a guy who was, uh, this guy and this girl, they were going to get married.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:30.340]   We found out kind of last minute that he had a track record of being abusive and they hadn't
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.620]   known each other very long, like only a couple of months.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.860]   And so, you know, before the wedding we said, Hey, we, we wouldn't do this.
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.140]   You guys should stop and, and date a little bit longer and, and let's see a track record
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.140]   of faithfulness.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.700]   And she said, no, he's, he's really charming.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.620]   You know, he's, he's been really kind to me and, and she was really upset with us for
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.620]   saying this.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.940]   And so they got married and they went on the honeymoon and they came off the honeymoon
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:01.420]   and he threw her down a flight of stairs and broke both of her legs.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:10.620]   And we were there, you know, pick up the pieces, but consider someone's reputation, their track
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.860]   record, where they've been.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.460]   She said, he's really charming.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.780]   You know, Proverbs says 31 verse 30, charm is deceptive.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.100]   And not only is charming is charm deceptive, but beauty is fleeting.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.580]   And then you're looking for a woman who fears the Lord.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.460]   What you want is you want their repentance to be as notorious as their rebellion.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.460]   Do you understand?
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.540]   Like, I'm not saying if they were rebellious, that they're disqualified from marriage.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:43.740]   I'm saying that they're qualified from, for marriage whenever their repentance is as notorious
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.060]   as their rebellion was.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.940]   And so I don't care if he's been to prison.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:47.940]   Okay.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.060]   Single parents make amazing spouses, but you want their repentance to be as notorious as
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   their rebellion.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.380]   And when you see that track record, you're like, Hey, let's go.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.820]   I don't care what they've done.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:05.300]   Christ can heal and fix anything, but that doesn't mean you need to be in a rush or just
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.580]   trust their words.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.900]   And so not only is charming charm, deceptive, but beauty is fleeting guys.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.320]   Can't just say something, man.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.420]   Some of your criteria is dumb.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.820]   All right.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.460]   Like you're walking around, you're talking to your boys.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.700]   You're like, man, I'm a boob guy.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.060]   I'm a butt guy.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.780]   You're a dumb guy.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.340]   You need to be a Bible guy.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.340]   All right.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.340]   Jesus Duke.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.340]   Okay.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.500]   You need to be a Bible guy.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.420]   You need to have criteria that God has.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   All right.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   Listen, listen.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.340]   If you're listening to this message, never ever say that again for the rest of your life.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.340]   Okay.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.340]   It's stupid.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.900]   All right.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.620]   It's dumb.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.220]   You do not love the things that God loves.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.400]   You love the things that pornography have taught you to love.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.620]   You need to repent and ask the Lord to change your heart and your mind so that you might
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:06.820]   be attracted to what he's attracted to when he says, I look at the heart.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.780]   Okay.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:14.580]   And so adjust your criteria to meet his criteria because it says that beauty is fleeting.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.820]   Here's all that means.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.300]   It's going away.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.660]   It's a depreciating asset.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   Nobody here, right?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:29.380]   If I said, Hey man, how many of you just think like some 80 year old woman's really hot.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.900]   Don't raise your hand if that's you.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.260]   Okay.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.980]   Probably you're like, not as just, not just my thing, but by the grace of God, maybe one
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:42.080]   day you might be married to an 80 year old.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.460]   And I still think you're going to be attracted to that 23 year old co-ed.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.660]   Okay.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:55.020]   But if you've learned commitment and to love the things that God loves, hopefully her heart
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.420]   is still attractive to you.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.980]   And let's face it, we're all getting uglier every day.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.060]   Okay.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.060]   That's what's happening.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060]   You're going to leave here.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   You're going to hate me.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060]   Think about it.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.300]   It's the truth.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.600]   Okay.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.560]   But your heart can get more and more beautiful.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.780]   And I pray the Lord brings somebody that would see that and notice that and realize that.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.820]   And so beauty is fleeting.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.820]   And here's what that, we just got to talk about this for a minute.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.020]   And so as you inspect what they do, we got to inspect how they dress.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.940]   Let's talk about modesty for a moment.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.900]   Are they trying to attract you with their character or with their abs, who they are
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.020]   or their curves, right?
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.780]   It matters.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.640]   And so this is where I think social media is just a real gift to us.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.240]   Because if she's like taking the picture, you know, cleavage, you know, perfect angle
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.660]   and everything, or she's laying on the bed and it looks like she wants to sleep with
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   you.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.940]   She probably wants to sleep with you.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   And I would run.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:57.300]   I would unfriend her and I would run the other direction and say, I do not want anything
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.420]   to do with that.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.860]   That's not who I'm looking to spend the rest of my life with.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.340]   And she's trying to waste my time.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.120]   And that goes for him too.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.140]   And so ladies, you will not catch a good guy with your body.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.540]   You will catch a guy that loves your body and he will leave you when your body leaves.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.180]   And ladies, your body's going to leave.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.580]   Okay.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.860]   You get nine months pregnant, your body's gone, you know, and it may come back.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.140]   Hey, Hey, stay with me.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.620]   It may come back.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.180]   It may come back and then you're going to do it again and it may come back and you're
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.180]   gonna do it again.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.380]   But listen, when you're 80 years old, your body's gone.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.060]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   You got it.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.740]   You come up here like, no, I'm gonna get Botox and plastic surgery.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.740]   And I'm going to do, no, come on.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.500]   You're going to be on botched or something.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.500]   Nip and tuck.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.180]   That's what I'm talking about right now.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.420]   First Peter three versus three through five says your beauty should not come from outward
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.420]   adornment.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   What, what, what does that mean?
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.020]   Why would God preserve that for thousands of years?
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   What are we talking about?
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.940]   If we're not talking about outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:14.700]   wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes, rather it should be that of your inner self, the
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:21.140]   unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.100]   What if we started applying that verse to our lives?
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.380]   Game changer.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.460]   And so ladies, do you address attractively?
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.460]   It's fine.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.300]   It's fine to put some effort in the way you look.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.140]   Or do you dress to attract like you're bait?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.540]   You're not bait ladies.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.540]   You're not bait.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.540]   You're a person.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.620]   You don't have to address to attract.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.620]   You can dress attractively, but you don't need to address to attract.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.620]   You're not bait.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:57.100]   You're not trying to catch a fish.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.420]   So people are known by what they do.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.980]   It's called a reputation.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.380]   I said when their repentance is notorious as their rebellion, that's when they've changed.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.220]   I mean, let me hit it home like this.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.860]   If, if I want to get a loan from the bank, like, let's just say I need $10,000 from the
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.540]   bank.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.740]   And so to get this loan, let's say I rent a car and say I've rent a Bentley, $400,000
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740]   Bentley.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.980]   Let's say I put on a $3,000 Brioni suit.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.180]   I walk in there with a leather binder.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.140]   I've got my act together.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.780]   I'm saying all the right things.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.380]   I sit down with that banker and I say, Hey, I need $10,000.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.700]   Now is he going to listen to what I say and look at what I'm wearing and look at what
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.060]   I drove up in and be like, Oh man, that's easy.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060]   You must be a millionaire.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.500]   Here's 10 grand.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.540]   What's he going to do?
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.100]   What's he going to do?
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.420]   He's going to check my credit because it's going to tell the real story.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.780]   He's going to look at my history because it doesn't lie.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.780]   The car can lie.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.860]   The suit can lie.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.820]   My words can lie.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:08.300]   Everything about me can lie, but the history doesn't lie.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.340]   I've heard it said that past behavior is the best indicator of future performance.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.180]   Past behavior is the best indicator of future performance.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.340]   And so am I saying you're disqualified from marriage?
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.980]   No, but I'm saying you need a season of faithfulness.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.140]   Third point, how do they love?
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.500]   You asked the question, how do they love?
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.760]   He says, do they set an example in how they love?
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.300]   How have they treated others?
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   They've dated.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.260]   You could interview their exes if that was even possible, but they probably be like,
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.540]   "Oh man, she's a psycho."
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.340]   Well, why did you date a psycho?
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   Can I ask you that question?
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.140]   "Oh, but no, no, no, you don't know.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   It was her problem."
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.420]   Okay, sure it was.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.660]   One seems right to another pleases case.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.980]   And so how do they love?
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.020]   How have they loved others?
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   Because here's the deal.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.100]   When we left, we just got back from this deal called launch retreat at Sky Ranch.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.060]   And whenever we left to Sky Ranch, the last thing that I said is I said, "Hey, we want
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.940]   to leave this place better than we found it."
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.460]   That's hard to do.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.940]   It's hard to leave a place better than you found it.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.140]   We want to pick up the trash.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.380]   We want to leave the cabins cleaner than we found them.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.620]   We want to have a great reputation with this incredible partner.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.620]   And that's how you date.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.720]   You leave somebody better than you found them.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.900]   That's how followers of Christ date with this new culturally idea that has only been around.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.560]   Dating as we know and understand it has only been around less than 100 years.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.620]   It started as a euphemism for prostitution.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.620]   True story.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.620]   Look it up later.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.700]   That's the history of dating.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.300]   So dating is not even necessary for marriage, but it is the way that our culture does it
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.860]   today.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.740]   And so as you date someone, as a follower of Jesus Christ, can you imagine that when
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.820]   you break up, they're like, "Man, I'm so glad we spent time together.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.820]   You encouraged me with your words.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.060]   You were kind to me.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.340]   You were a picture of what it looks like when a man treats a woman with respect or a woman
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.020]   treats a man with respect and love.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.480]   It was incredible.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   Thank you for the time.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.140]   I'm sorry that it didn't work out, but I'm really glad we got to know each other when
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.140]   we did.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.140]   And my heart didn't dry.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.140]   I didn't give it to you.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.140]   That's mine.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.380]   That hardly exists today, but you leave here and you try that, and I'm telling you, it's
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.100]   going to save you so much time and heartache.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.580]   You leave someone better than you found them.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.820]   Did they leave others they've dated better than they found them?
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.700]   Or are they driving down the road, looking at the rear view mirror of dating, and there's
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.820]   just cars piled up?
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.540]   Wrecks, baggage, hurts, heartache.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.740]   How do they date?
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.220]   How do they date?
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.220]   How do they love?
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.360]   You asked me, why do you love them?
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.100]   Sometimes people say, because the way they make me feel.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.040]   Will you just listen to that?
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.380]   How selfish is that?
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.980]   I love them because of the way they make me feel.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.140]   What about when you don't feel that anymore?
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.300]   Do we love God because of the way he makes us feel?
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.420]   No, we love God because of who he is, because sometimes the feelings aren't there.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.080]   Sometimes you don't want to get in the Bible.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.580]   Sometimes you don't want to seek him.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.140]   You do not love God because of the way he makes you feel.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.100]   You love him because of who he is.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.420]   The way that he's loved us, he invented it.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.220]   You don't love somebody because of the way they make you feel.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.420]   You love them out of a commitment.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.980]   The emotion, as Adam said a few weeks ago, it plays a tiny part in it, but it is not
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.980]   ultimate.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:43.780]   As you're considering someone, have they followed their feelings in and out of a relationship?
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.220]   That's what happens when you follow your feelings.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.260]   You follow your feelings in and out of jobs, in and out of relationships.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.940]   A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings define their reality.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.940]   Let me say that again.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.860]   A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings define their reality.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:05.080]   A sign of maturity is when the truth defines reality, regardless of how they feel.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.620]   But a sign of a lack of maturity is when their feelings define what is real for them, because
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.700]   our feelings change.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.740]   That's why you have to look past the feelings of love to the action, the verb of love.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.260]   How does she care for people?
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.460]   Is she compassionate?
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.000]   Where does she serve?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.140]   How does he treat people who can do nothing for him?
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.500]   Not you when he's dating you and trying to trick you into marrying him.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.000]   How does he treat people who can do nothing for him in return?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.060]   The homeless man on the side of the road, the server in the restaurant, the person who
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.180]   just cut him off in traffic.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.160]   At what point does he feel entitled toward anger?
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.820]   Because that's when he's going to feel entitled toward anger to you.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.140]   Is he controlled by the spirit or controlled by his emotions?
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.340]   If he doesn't treat you well, it's done.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.420]   Listen, I'm tired, and I mean this as lovingly as I can.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.660]   My motive, I got no other motive than for you to have a happy marriage.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.860]   If he's cheated on you, it's done.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.020]   Well, where's the grace in that, JP?
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.760]   Man, extend grace, right?
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.900]   When there's something, you know, small, overlook a small offense.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.480]   If he's identified himself in a dating relationship as unfaithful.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.240]   If she's cheated on you, you don't need to continue that relationship.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.860]   They're not walking with Christ.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:33.660]   They did something with someone else they shouldn't even do with you.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.340]   And so stop tricking yourself into our modern idea of dating and say, I'm going to go find
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.820]   someone fully yielded to Jesus.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:46.240]   You said, well, where's the grace in that?
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.660]   It may be the most graceful thing you could possibly do is to show them that, hey, that
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.180]   will not be tolerated by the church.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.940]   Okay.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:03.340]   Extend grace in marriage possibly once there's a covenant commitment there, but not in dating
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.860]   in regards to that specific infringement.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.660]   So ladies, is he considered of your feelings?
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.860]   Is he just running game?
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.960]   Does he initiate or does he leave you wondering constantly?
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   Is he intentional?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:27.580]   Men, does she thrive on drama or she's steady in difficult situations?
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.160]   I'm not saying that your relationship history DQs you from marriage.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.620]   I'm saying you want to track record.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.780]   You want to season of faithfulness, walking with God.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:43.020]   This that there's never been a divorce between two people who are committed to walking with
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.020]   Christ.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.100]   It's never happened in the history of history.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:53.100]   Divorce rate about 50% marriage satisfaction rate, much lower 20% but between two people
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.340]   fully committed to Christ, there's never been a divorce between those two people ever.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.340]   It's never happened.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:02.660]   And so I'm not saying your history DQs you the other day we bought a car for Monica.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.940]   I kind of told you before some of that process, but we found one and inexpensive one that
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.900]   we can afford, I should say.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.660]   And I ran before we purchased it, I ran Carfax and it had been in a wreck.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.700]   This car was discounted accordingly.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.380]   And for some that would be like, Hey, I'm not going to touch it.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.380]   It's been in an accident.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.100]   But what I looked at it as that Carfax is it had been in a wreck three and a half years
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.100]   ago.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.980]   It was repaired and it hadn't had any problems since then.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:35.580]   You see that the wreck doesn't DQ you, but the season of faithfulness is what qualifies
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:42.580]   you a season of walking in relationship, committed to Christ.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.260]   The fourth thing is what do they believe?
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.100]   He says, do they set an example in faith?
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   What do they believe?
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.940]   This is a big one of really important one.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.240]   This is not a check the box.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   They go to church.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.460]   I met him at the porch, right?
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.420]   There are people here who are going to use this list to pray on you.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   That's the reality.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.580]   There are people here pretending and posing.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.860]   There are wolves among the sheep.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.080]   We will find you.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.900]   We will expose you.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   That's the truth.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.900]   Okay.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   We're looking for you.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:17.020]   But for those of you that are here that are looking for this list, you want to consider,
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.420]   Hey, what is their faith?
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.420]   Not like this.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.420]   Okay.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.880]   Yeah, I'm not, I'm, I'm a Christian.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.120]   That's their words, but is the trajectory of their life that they're committed.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.180]   They're connected to a church.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.300]   The members they're serving, they're in community.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.460]   They wake up, they get into God's word.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   It's it marks them.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.460]   This is important.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.680]   Second Corinthians six 14 says, do not be an equally yoked with non believers.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.540]   What do righteousness and wickedness have in common or what fellowship can light have
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   with darkness?
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.820]   I've said this before.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.060]   People have gotten so angry at me.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.660]   This is like basic, basic stuff.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:59.840]   If you're a follower of Christ, you don't date someone not following Christ period.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   That would be detrimental.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.100]   If Christ is the most important thing to you in your life and they don't believe in him,
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.680]   then what are you doing?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.180]   You're wasting their time there.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.620]   You're wasting your time.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:19.900]   And so you're looking for someone who has already committed to Christ.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.540]   If you never get married, you'll be okay.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.020]   If you never have sex, you will be okay, man.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.980]   And if you've had all kinds of sex and you have all kinds of, of history or you've done
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.760]   everything wrong, I want you to know there is hope for you in the gospel.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.080]   It is never too late to take your life and to say, Christ, I'm ready to go all in with
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   you.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.480]   I'm going to connect to your body, the church.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.400]   I'm going to, I'm going to surround myself with other people running hard after you.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.200]   I'm going to begin to learn and know your word.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   It's never too late.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.040]   I don't care if you're 80 and your body's failed you.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.280]   It's still, you can still jump in with Jesus.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   It's never, ever, ever too late.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:08.280]   They should be in community, study the word, belong to a church running with Christians.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.140]   This is why where you look really matters.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.760]   Just real quick.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.260]   Okay.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:18.760]   Like it's, you want to look where that relatively small group of people that you can marry is
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.460]   all the time.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:26.880]   Like I can find a Christian book at Barnes and Nobles.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.380]   Like I can walk into that book, big bookstore and I can try to like navigate, okay, where
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:35.480]   is the Christian, the faith section and in the faith section, I want to go to the Christian
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.200]   section and then in that Christian section, there's going to be some Christian books there.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.380]   I can search for it there, but it's a lot easier to find a Christian book in a Christian
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.380]   bookstore, right?
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:50.060]   If I go to Lagos or Lifeway, like the odds are if you blindfold me and I grab a book
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.820]   off the shelf in Barnes and Nobles, it's probably not Christian.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.900]   You blindfold me and I grab a book off the shelf at Lifeway.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   It probably is.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.400]   I'm not saying there's not crazy there.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   There's heretics there.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.700]   There's people that have written books that call themselves Christians with whack theology.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.740]   That's certainly there, but more than likely you grab a book off the shelf in a Christian
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.860]   bookstore and it's going to be a Christian book.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.860]   The same is true.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.900]   Like you, can you find someone to spend the rest of your life with in the bar or the club?
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.420]   I guess it's possible.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.940]   Like if you want to stack the odds against God and see, I guess you can do that, right?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   Why would you do that?
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:32.980]   Why not just go to where the people you can marry go and hang out there and grab one off
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.980]   the shelf?
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.380]   Likewise, you could find a Christian.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.300]   I'm not saying that all of them here are Christian.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.700]   There's crazy here too, I promise.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.620]   Fifth one, last one.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.700]   It's a big one too, though.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.360]   They're all big, honestly.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   They're all important.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.820]   That's why they're on the list.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.580]   Are they relentless about purity?
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.060]   This is the only yes or no question on here.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:03.020]   It's a yes or no question.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.060]   Are they relentless about purity?
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.340]   He says, "Set an example in your purity."
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.700]   The word is translated chastity.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:18.780]   It's this, the state or practice of refraining from extramarital or especially from all sexual
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.260]   intercourse.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.500]   Set an example in your purity.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.060]   I want to tell you why it really matters.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:35.900]   Because remember, they're supposed to be fully committed to Christ.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:46.700]   If they'll push the envelope with you or with pornography or with someone else or by themselves,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.500]   they're saying something.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:41:01.660]   They're saying, "Hey, I'm committed to having sex, pursuing intercourse outside of marriage.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.780]   I'm telling you that right now.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.740]   Like my feelings, my desires, I put them before God's word.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.340]   I do what I want to do when I want to do it.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:18.420]   If this is the boundary of marriage, I'm telling you right now as we're dating, as I push this,
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.620]   as I try to talk you into this thing with me, I'm telling you something.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.240]   I'm telling you the marital institution or God's institution of marriage is not ultimate
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   to me.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   It is not important to me.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.660]   If it was, I would marry you and then bring up the conversation.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:38.580]   But instead I'm bringing it up out here because I don't think it can happen outside of the
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.580]   confines of marriage."
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.820]   They're saying something.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.340]   They're saying this, "I'm an adulterer.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.340]   I live this, man.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:53.040]   And here's what I mean by that is I had sex outside of marriage, was addicted to pornography.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.060]   I got inside of marriage and I thought, oh, this is going to be awesome because I have
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.700]   someone I can have sex with whenever I want.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.380]   It's not really how it works.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.140]   Okay, that's just loving counsel to you.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.780]   I know you may think that like, man, you just must get home and have sex three or four or
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.020]   five or six times.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.940]   I told you last week, you know, my friend says, I hope you never have sex, but that
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:18.780]   with your spouse, you pursue intimacy, that we redefine that word.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.260]   And so as someone who had jumped in and out of relationships, as soon as they got hard,
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.900]   I had trained myself for divorce my entire life.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.700]   And so two years in a marriage, I'm like, man, this is hard.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.740]   I want out.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.420]   I want to go outside of my marriage.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.420]   That's all I know.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.620]   I was addicted to it.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.020]   And by the grace of God, I didn't, aside from pornography, which I did.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.860]   And God has restored me and he's healed my marriage.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.740]   But I'm saying this to you.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.140]   So that's not your strategy, is hope.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.340]   But that right now you would pursue healing.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:00.740]   Right now you would pursue that track record of faithfulness because I've married people,
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.740]   guys.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:07.100]   And, and like, like some of them, like they waited till the altar to kiss.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.180]   They never kissed until they were sound was right there.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.260]   I'm doing the wedding.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.260]   Their friends are there.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.260]   The friends are watching the first kiss.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.940]   And I know that some of you right now are like, that is crazy.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.100]   Okay.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.580]   I want you to, here's, here's the truth.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.460]   It's not like they didn't want to.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:28.300]   It's not like they weren't extremely tempted to constantly, but you imagine with me for
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.940]   a moment how protected that marriage is now, how crafty is the enemy that he says, man,
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.700]   you want to make sure you do that on this side of marriage.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.700]   I've never, ever, ever talked to the married couple who said, man, I wish we'd went further
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.220]   when we were dating.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.580]   We should have tried more stuff out, you know, make sure everything's fits.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.700]   It's crazy.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.220]   I've never met that couple.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.540]   And you're laughing, but I know you've said it crazy stuff like that.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.740]   And it's ridiculous.
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.860]   That's why it's funny right now because it's ridiculous.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.180]   And can I tell you something about the couple?
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.380]   I'm not even saying I'm not prescribing that as the law for you.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.340]   I'm saying for those of you that just said, why'd they wait until they were married to
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.900]   kiss my hunches.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.420]   I'm going to go on a limb.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.140]   They have a better marriage than you will.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.300]   This is my hunch.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.980]   I mean, I married a lot of people, dozens and dozens of people.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.020]   My hunch is their marriage is better than yours.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.780]   Follow them as they follow Christ.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.380]   First Corinthians 6, 18 verse 20, flee from sexual immorality, run from it.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.580]   All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.780]   his own body.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:42.220]   Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy spirit who is in you whom you've
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.660]   received from God?
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.060]   You are not your own.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.220]   You were bought by a price.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.020]   Therefore honor God with your body.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:56.180]   And so if you're asking how far is too far, you, you've already gone too far in your mind.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.840]   It says flee from sexual immorality.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.940]   How far is too far?
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.140]   Run the other way.
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.140]   Go the other.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.420]   How, what can, can we hold hands?
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.220]   I don't know if you hold hands at the altar, you probably be glad you did, but if you don't
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.580]   find what, I don't know, right?
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.180]   I'm not, I'm not here to put law on you.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.500]   I'm saying pursue absolute purity.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.220]   I wish I would have.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.220]   Some people are like, no regrets.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.220]   I'm like, that's ridiculous.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.220]   I've got tons.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.200]   I've got lots of regrets, man.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.700]   Everything that I did that was not God's will.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.500]   I regret everything I did that went against God's commands.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.100]   I regret, did you hear what it said?
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.260]   It says you are not your own.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.180]   I'm going to go a little bit long tonight.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:44.140]   I'm just going to tell you, cause there's a lot here, but we're almost done.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.780]   It says you are not your own.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.180]   It says you've been bought at a price.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.500]   You ever have somebody borrow something from you?
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.580]   iPhone charger, truck.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.580]   You got a truck.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.580]   I'll borrow your truck.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   You ever had this?
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.580]   You're like in your roommate's closet.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.140]   You're like, how did my shoes get in here, girl?
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.220]   You didn't even ask, you know, where'd you wear these?
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.100]   You ever have somebody borrow something from you?
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:13.860]   I know this is like total dad illustration, but we had a bounce house and, um, people
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.220]   would want to borrow it all the time.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.180]   And so they would call, Hey, can we borrow your bounce house, man?
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.220]   We have this like birthday party for, you know, second graders.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.700]   Can we borrow your bounce house?
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   Sure, man.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.260]   You know, you can borrow the bounce house.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.860]   But when they would, I would say, Hey, here, here's the rules to the bounce house.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.540]   You know, no more than five people in it.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.540]   It's a small bounce house.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.580]   No more than five people in it.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.580]   No adults.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.900]   It's not like commercial grades, you know?
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.660]   And uh, and, and you know, here's, uh, here's where I'd love to have it back.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.900]   Why am I giving them rules?
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:45.260]   Why would I expect that they follow the rules of my bounce house?
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.700]   Because it's my bounce house.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.320]   That's why you are not your own.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.700]   You are not your own.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.860]   You were bought by a price.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.580]   That's why I can tell you how to treat your body because it belongs to me.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.860]   You have it on loan.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.700]   And so while you borrow that body from God, I would lean in heavily and say, Hey God,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.100]   what do you want me to do with it?
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.740]   And what don't you want me to do with it?
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.040]   Okay.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.380]   Because he loves you.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.500]   I'm not making rules for the bounce house just for fun.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   It eventually popped in the possession of somebody else.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:24.020]   I'm still a little angry about it anyways, right?
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:30.840]   He's telling you this because he loves you and he cares about you and he wants good things
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.900]   for you.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.140]   And it's never too late to follow his commands.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:40.540]   In summary, inspect what do they say?
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.340]   What are they known for?
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.820]   What do they love?
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.300]   What do they believe?
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:53.780]   And how are they relentless about purity?
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.780]   Are they relentless about purity?
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:07.700]   I have a friend, Ryan, he was, came to the porch and just kind of really learned a lot
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.260]   of these things, just kind of God's desires for dating.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.740]   And he took note of this girl that was very different than his criteria.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.380]   Like he thought, you know, I'd marry a blonde and she'd be this short or this tall or whatever.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.800]   And she was just different than all the things like his worldly list.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.140]   But he realized that she met the godly criteria.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.740]   And so before he left for an international discipleship trip or a mission trip, he said
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.340]   to her, Hey, I'd like to ask you out when I get back.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   And he goes on the trip.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:37.140]   Now she's thinking, well, I mean, this guy is nothing that I thought that I would be
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.140]   married to.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.940]   And so I'm not, you know, he's just not what I'm looking for in a guy.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.380]   But as she began to pray about it, she committed to praying about it while he was gone.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.380]   She went through this list.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.860]   She says, you know what?
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.580]   All of his words build people up.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.620]   And he has a great reputation among his friends in his community.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.960]   And it seems like he loves well, like he's caring and compassionate and gentle and good
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   to others.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.380]   He has a good reputation there.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.900]   I know that he's committed to purity.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.180]   I know that the guys that he's running with are committed to helping him be committed
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.180]   to purity.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.860]   And I know he loves Jesus.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.140]   Why wouldn't I give this a shot?
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.140]   When he got back, she said, yeah, I'll give it a shot.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.140]   We can go on a date.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.500]   They've been married now for a couple of years.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.620]   I got to do their wedding.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.580]   And so listen, okay.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.940]   And they have an incredible ministry together.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:31.940]   That's that's the punchline.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.820]   I mean, God has strengthened their ministry together because this life is about him.
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   Right?
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.700]   Marriage is this metaphor of Christ in the church.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.700]   I don't know if you know this.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   I don't have time to teach you now.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.700]   We're out of time.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.420]   But marriage, God gave it to us.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.860]   It's a metaphor of how he loves us and how he's committed to us.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.340]   What criteria did he give you?
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:57.620]   Did he want you curvy, blonde, brunette, dark skin, light skin before you come to him before
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   you can spend forever with him?
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.660]   What criteria did he have?
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:10.780]   Once your heart, once your heart, he's so much more concerned with what you believe
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.260]   than what you look like.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.200]   You see that you should be too.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   You know what happened?
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.740]   I found those sunglasses eventually.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.860]   RB 8301, believe it or not, size 56.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   You know what I did?
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.220]   I bought them.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.500]   I committed to them.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.340]   They met the standard.
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.780]   They were what I'm looking for.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.700]   You're not looking for a person.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.460]   You're looking for character traits that would make a great spouse.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.660]   Begin to look for those character traits.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.660]   Redefine your standards.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.820]   Redefine your list.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.900]   Consider Christ's list towards you.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.420]   I'm going to pray and we're going to move towards worship.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.180]   I'd love for you just to think through this list.
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.180]   I hope you wrote it down.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.500]   If you can't, you can go back and listen to it.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:10.940]   Father, thank you that there's nothing that we've done or a way that we look or a way
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.860]   that we dress that disqualifies us from you.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.620]   But that in the gospel, you're rushing toward us.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.980]   You're jealous for us.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.580]   You love us through amazing grace.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.060]   You care about us.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.860]   Father, thank you for this list of traits that you scribe through your servant Paul
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.380]   to Timothy.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:39.420]   I pray that you would help that be a fruitful list for my friends here this evening as they
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.640]   consider who they might spend the rest of their life with.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.140]   Would you use it in their hearts and their lives and their minds and in their communities?
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:52.380]   Father, we thank you that we can laugh together and that we can study your word together and
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.280]   just that it gives life, that it never returns void.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.160]   Most of all, Lord, we're thankful for how you love us.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:14.520]   In 1 Samuel 16, God sends Samuel to look for a king to rule his people.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.640]   Samuel sees Eliab and thinks, "Hey, perfect.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   This guy looks like a king."
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.520]   God says, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him."
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.920]   The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.560]   People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:39.800]   And so if they don't have these five character traits, they're not right for you in this
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   season.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.040]   You don't need to wonder.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.800]   You don't need to try on a bunch of different things or ask, "Hey, how do they make me feel?"
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   It's just not right.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.720]   It doesn't fit in this season.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.000]   And if they do meet those character traits, you're like, "Man, they got them."
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.240]   There's people running through your mind.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.520]   They're like, "Well, I know a lot of people that fit those character traits."
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   I mean, we just got back from like 1,000 people in Sky Ranch, and like 200 or 300 of them
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.600]   would fit, I'm guessing, would fit those character traits really well.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:14.280]   And if you say, "Yeah, but I'm just not attracted to them," then what I would encourage you
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:21.840]   to do is look inward and then say, "God, what is it in me that causes me not to be attracted
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.200]   to the things that you're attracted to?"
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.600]   And so what maturing do I need to do?
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.680]   What time do I need to spend with you that this person whom you've said would make an
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:40.280]   incredible life partner, but I'm just not attracted to them in the things that are fleeting?
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.920]   And so that's just good heart surgery.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   I'm not saying it's your fault.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.080]   I'm not even saying it's your problem.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.800]   I'm just saying it's something to think through and to pray through.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.160]   There's nothing that I want more.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.140]   I mean, I would love to shut this ministry down just because everybody in it just gets
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.800]   married and happily ever after.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   Like, that would be awesome.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.200]   We do the wedding here, like 3,000 or 4,000 of you just get married, it'd be awesome,
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.080]   you know, right?
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.120]   But some of you, before we get there, right, you need a season of faithfulness.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   Let us help you with that.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   It's time to go all in with Jesus.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   He loves you.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   He's crazy about you.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:19.740]   He gave his life for you, for all your sins, for everything you've done wrong.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:24.240]   And so tonight, if you're looking for community, you realize you don't have believers around
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   you.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.040]   Guys, you go down this hallway, and there's a room full of people there that are also
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.040]   looking for community.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:34.080]   Girls, you go down this hallway, not Snapchat, but down this hallway, and there's a room
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.800]   full of people there that are looking for community.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.660]   And outside, as you go outside, you're gonna see all these booths, and these are ministry
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.680]   partners of ours.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.320]   These are people who have effective ministry, are doing effective ministry in the city.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.800]   And you can just stop by those booths and ask them questions and serve with them.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.440]   They're looking for people to help them further the mission, and you may be a great candidate.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.880]   And so talk to them.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.640]   And then if you're here and you're in college, we have a party for you upstairs.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.540]   And so go to the second floor and look for my friends in the college ministry.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.540]   They would love to meet you tonight.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:08.680]   And go up to my friend Adam Tarnow or Paige or Rachel or Daniel and just introduce yourself,
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   okay?
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.600]   And for the rest of you, if we can pray for you or talk to you about anything, you have
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.560]   questions about something I said, you disagreed with it or you really agreed with it or whatever
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.240]   that is, we'd love to talk with you.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.760]   Find somebody with a light bulb on their shirt.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.720]   They would love to minister to you and pray with you.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.720]   Love you guys.
