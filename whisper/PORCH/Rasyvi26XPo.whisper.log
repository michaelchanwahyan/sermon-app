[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.520]   I want to start by introducing you guys to someone, okay?
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.320]   So I want you to meet my, not my friend, but someone.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   Lesia, this is a picture of her.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   It's coming, there you go.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.240]   She is a sweet girl.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.480]   And so Lesia made national news this week.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.940]   I don't know if you saw it,
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.520]   but she met a guy, okay,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.040]   and fell head over heels in love with him.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.760]   And within 12 hours, he convinced her
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.480]   to get his name tattooed across her face.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.320]   Okay?
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.720]   And so I'm going to show you,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.360]   if you are squeamish,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.400]   you're going to want to look away
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.980]   or close your eyes for just a minute.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.400]   But I'm going to show you the picture
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.440]   of her getting her name, his name,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.000]   a tattooed across her face.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.480]   It did make national news.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.320]   This was, this went viral this weekend.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.720]   And so there she is.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   His name is Ruslan.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.280]   So R-U-S on one side, L-A-N on the other side.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.720]   Five inch Gothic script letters, okay?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.440]   Here's a picture of the beautiful couple together,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.880]   happily ever after.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.800]   There they are.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   His name across her face.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   What was interesting in the article,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.400]   a couple things stood out to me.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.080]   One is just the way that people responded,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.360]   much like the way you responded,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   much like the way I responded, gasp,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.680]   and then you could comment below,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.800]   and it was just like things like,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.040]   what an idiot, I can't believe she did that.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.560]   She deserves to have that name across her face.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.640]   And then people would say,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240]   he should be arrested for having done that,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.080]   those sorts of things.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.520]   And so it was just like full of comments,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.640]   one after the other,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.320]   kind of this, just this hateful speech.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.280]   And what the article also went on to say
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.800]   is it insinuated that the two,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.920]   within the 12 hours of meeting, had had sex.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.200]   And so that got me thinking,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   that got me wondering,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.480]   which was the worst act?
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.720]   Okay, which act was more offensive to God?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.960]   Within 12 hours, her meeting this guy
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.320]   and giving her body to him in the form of sex,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.680]   or getting his name tattooed across her face?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   Which of those was more offensive?
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.280]   And because in the same way, I see it,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.040]   which of those has more consequences?
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.120]   Is it the act of sex, which you can't see on her,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   or these six, five-inch Gothic script letters
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.560]   across her face, which of those has more consequences?
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   If you were to ask me that,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.160]   everything in me wants to scream at you,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.360]   of course, the crazy tattoo going across her jaw.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   But what I hope to show you tonight
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.880]   is that as we open God's Word,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   And so before we dive in,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   I want you to know that if you know me at all,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   if we've ran together at all,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   you know sexual addiction is a huge part of my past
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.360]   that I'm in recovery from.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.360]   I have a very spotted past as far as that goes.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   I thought about starting in the '90s.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   We're talking about sexual addiction.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   As far as that goes, I thought about starting in the '90s.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   We're talking about sexual immorality,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.360]   and I am an expert, you know, as we open the Word of God.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   And so I want you to know there's grace and forgiveness,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   and I hope you leave with that,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   or you have an understanding of that before you leave,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   but we are gonna dive in to look at
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   what the Bible has to say about this.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   And so I just thought, you know,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   sex is way more powerful than a tattoo.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   It has the potential to be way more destructive.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   It is impossible to remove its mark,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   and even more dangerous because it is so easy to hide.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   We can mask it.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   We can mask it so that the world doesn't see the act,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   and we can convince ourselves that it is just sex.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   In fact, that is the myth that we're in tonight.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   We're doing this series called Cupid, Dating Myths,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   and so the dating myth is that you would try before you buy
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   that it's just sex or no strings attached,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   you know, friends with benefits.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   These things that the world tells you are,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   hey, this is just normal,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   and so we're gonna talk about just this idea
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   of physical boundaries and what the Scripture has to say.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   We're gonna talk about why sex is powerful,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   how purity is possible,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   and then before you leave here tonight,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   why purity is even important,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   and not just a churchy idea.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   And so we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   if you have your Bibles turned there.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   This is Paul's letter to the church at Corinth,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   which is a great place to start tonight
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.360]   because there is some crazy things going on
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   in the church of Corinth, okay?
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   Now, I can think about, as I look back in history,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   this is one of the few times in history
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   that it may have been a more sex-raged culture
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   than America today or even Europe today.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360]   There are some crazy things going on in the church of Corinth.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   In fact, many people, when they came into Christianity
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360]   in the church of Corinth,
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.360]   their religious background would have had them
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   go to a temple to sleep with prostitutes
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   as an act of worship.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   And so there were temples with over 500 prostitutes
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   that you would go to as an act of worship
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   and you would sleep with a prostitute,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   and that is what it meant to worship.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   And so, you know, there were, as you can imagine,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.360]   a long line for that religion.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   And so 1 Corinthians 6, we'll start in verse 12.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.360]   He just says this, "Everything is permissible for me."
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   In your Bible, that's probably in quotes.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.360]   He says, "Everything is permissible for me,
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   "but not everything is beneficial."
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   And then in quotes again,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   "Everything is permissible for me,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   "but I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   Here's what's going on.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   The Corinthians had taken this idea
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   that everything was permissible
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.360]   under the concept of grace in the Christian church,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   and they had made it this slogan,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   this tagline that they would add to their unrighteous deeds.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   And so they would do something,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   so maybe just they would get drunk and say,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   "Well, everything is permissible."
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Or they would have sex, say, "Well, everything is permissible."
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   It is like the common, or it was the ancient version of,
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   you know, grace abounds, or there's always forgiveness.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   You know, so, hey, it's just sex.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   Everything is permissible.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   And so they're throwing this around, and Paul is saying,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   "Hey, hey, everything is permissible,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   "but not everything is beneficial.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   "Everything is permissible,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   "but I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   And then this other line in quotes,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   "Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   "but God will destroy them both," Paul writes.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   And so also in quotes, "Food for the stomach,
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   "and the stomach for food."
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   What they're saying is, this was another saying
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   that they would say, is say, "Hey, if it looks good, do it.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   "Hey, if I'm hungry, if my stomach is hungry,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   "then my body's gonna move towards food.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   "So food for the stomach, and the stomach for food.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   "It's just me satisfying my sexual appetite,"
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   is where Paul's gonna go.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   If you don't know the context, the historical context,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   it seems like he takes a huge left turn.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   He doesn't.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   He is addressing the sexual dysfunction
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   in this church at this time.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.360]   "The body," now, "The body is not meant
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   "for sexual immorality, but for the Lord,
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   "and the Lord for the body.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   "By his power, God raised the Lord from the dead,
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   "and he will raise us also.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   "Do you not know that your bodies
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   "are members of Christ himself?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   "Shall I then take members of Christ
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   "and unite them with a prostitute?
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   "Never!" exclamation point.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   "Do you not know that he who unites himself
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   "with a prostitute is one with her in body,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   "for it is said, 'The two will become one flesh.'
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   "But he who unites himself with the Lord
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   "is one with him in spirit."
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   And so Paul is combating these phrases that are abused,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   like, "Try it before you buy it," or, "It's just sex.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   "There's no strings attached.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   "There's always grace.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   "Friends with benefits."
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   And he's saying, "Hey, Church of Corinth,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   "don't you understand?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   "You are representatives of the God Most High,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   "our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   "You are little Jesuses walking around.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   "If you claim to follow Jesus,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   "you are his representative in a world going that way,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   "a world with a strong current saying,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   "'Hey, this way, this way, this way.'"
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   He's saying, "No, man, I follow Christ this way.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   "I'm marching against the current."
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   He's saying, "Corinthians, porch goers,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   "Church of Dallas, you must raise up
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   "and march against this strong current
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   "of a sex-crazed culture."
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   And he's calling them out.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   And so my first point tonight is this,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   that sex is powerful.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   It's this simple idea.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   He said, "Sex is powerful."
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   And so this is why the body is not meant
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   for sexual immorality.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   Sex is powerful.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   Sometimes it feels like we're just like
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   these babies playing with machine guns.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   We don't really know what we're doing,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   and we don't really know of the effects
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   of what we're doing 'til much later in life.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   That is absolutely my story.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   I live today under the consequences
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   of my sexual sin pre-marriage.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   Sex is powerful.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   And so sexual immorality, let's define that
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360]   because that's one of those words I think
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   we can use to justify our actions.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   And so here's the definition of sexual immorality.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   It is the pursuit of sexual pleasure outside of marriage.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   It is the, sexual immorality is the pursuit
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   of sexual pleasure outside of marriage, okay?
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   So it's oral sex, anal sex, regular sex.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   It can be not sex, heavily making out.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   It is the pursuit of sexual pleasure
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   outside of marriage.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   It can be looking at it, thinking about it,
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   acting out on it.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   And you don't have to wonder, right,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   if what you're doing is wrong,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   because Paul's command is gonna be,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   "Hey, flee from this, like run from it."
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   And so we also see that we're prostituting it,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   and there's a risk that you could look at this text
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   and say, "Well, I'm not sleeping with prostitutes."
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   And so I'll define the Greek word there
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   for prostitute is porne, and it is this.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   Any woman indulging in unlawful sexual intercourse,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   whether for gain or for lust.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   Any woman indulging in unlawful sexual intercourse,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   whether for gain or for lust.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Here's what I'm telling you, there is not just sex.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   And the reality of it is that science knows this.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Psychology knows this.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   In fact, psychologists have come up with this term
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   called sex glue, okay.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   Sex glue is the powerful bond that God describes
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   in the Bible that happens when a man and a woman
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   give themselves to each other, sex glue.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   It is the building of brain synapses
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   that occur during orgasm in the act of sex, okay.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   Let me explain.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   Sex glue, this thing that science has now discovered
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   that God says, "Hey, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   "and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   They will bond together.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   Paul says, "Hey, do not bond to someone
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   "unless you're married to them," right.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   And so this idea of sex glue is that during the act of sex,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   during specifically the act of orgasm,
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   that your brain would create a synapse
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   that bonds your five senses to its surrounding.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   The sense of smell and touch and sight,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   whatever you're looking at.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   And so you can understand why God, the creator of sex,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   so check this out, you've gotta get this.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   God invented sex.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   He is crazy pro-sex.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   God, do you get it?
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Like he made the parts.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   You understand that?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   Like he designed them as God.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   He designed them.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   He put the nerve endings where they are.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   Like he made it feel good in the way that it does,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   but that pleasure, and this is the important part,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   that pleasure serves a purpose.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   And so what we try to do as a society
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   marching and raging against God
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   is we try to capture that pleasure
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   and separate it from that purpose.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   We try to have sex so that there is no procreation.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   We try to have sex outside of marriage.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   We try to have sex by ourselves
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   so that we can enjoy the pleasure outside of the purpose.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   You tracking with me?
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   This was never God, the designers of sex, his intentions.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   And so sex glue, in fact, if you,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   I have a friend that went and saw a sex therapist
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   as a married person, and she said,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   "When you do this act, look your wife in the eyes
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   "and bond with her face,"
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   because the reality of it, if you're looking at her breast
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   or some other body part,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   there are women walking around with those same body parts
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   that your brain could bond to,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   that you could say, "Hey, I want that, those body parts.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360]   "I wish my wife had those kind of body parts."
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   But when you look at her in the eyes, right,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   her face is like a thumbprint that bonds to your heart.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   And that's not a prescription,
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   that just kind of quantifies this part of just this idea
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   that God created sex for the purpose of bonding.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   Sex is powerful.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   Let me explain how I know sex is powerful
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   outside of my own experience.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   Tonight, every Tuesday, every single week,
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   someone will come up to me,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   and they're nervous, you know.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   Maybe they're intimidated,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   or maybe they've never verbalized
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360]   what they're about to say.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   They've never got the words out of their mouth.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   And they come up and they say,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   "Hey, I gotta talk to you about something.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   "It's big, I never told anybody."
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   And I don't need to know.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   I know what it is.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   I mean, it's masturbation, pornography, sexual abuse.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   I'm pregnant, she's pregnant.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360]   I had an abortion.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   It is something around this act.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.360]   Sex is powerful.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   Every single week without fail,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   if I look back in ministry,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   and I see someone being owned by this,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   and people that are like,
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   "Hey, it happened to me 27 years ago."
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   But I still carry it around.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   I've never told anybody.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   You see, sex is powerful.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   God created it for a purpose.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   And you go out in that world,
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   you're gonna go out those doors,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   and the world's gonna tell you,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   "Hey, it's no big deal."
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   And it just gets more messed up,
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.360]   and more messed up,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   and more messed up.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   And so, we know sex is powerful
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   because we see that porn and sexual addiction
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   requires a difficult path of healing.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   Do you understand?
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   Like, if you're here,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   and you know that sexual abuse is a part of your path,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   or porn is a part of your story,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   or these things, they require healing.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   It's okay.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   But you don't wanna walk around
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   and mask it like a cancer,
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   and deny chemotherapy.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Chemotherapy is hard.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   It's difficult.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   But it's necessary for survival.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.360]   And while chemotherapy is difficult,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   it's better than cancer.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   And so, you have to go through a process of recovery
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   and letting the Lord's Spirit,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   His Holy Spirit,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   the same one who created the heavens and the earth,
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   begin to heal you.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   And that starts with raising your hand.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.360]   Like, "I need help, man. Not now."
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   I don't wanna scare you.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   I really don't.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   I hate that.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   You know, the scare tactics don't work.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   And so, you know, the wrong reasons not to have sex
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   is because one in four of you here tonight
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   have an STD in this room,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   and most of you don't know it.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   I mean, those are scare tactics.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   It's true.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   It's reality.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   It's this idea that sex will keep you
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   in the wrong relationship too long.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   It certainly will.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Sex will keep you from the right relationship
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360]   when it comes along.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   It certainly will.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   I see that every single week.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   But frankly, the consequences to sex
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   will come in forms that you would have never expected.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   Let me share with you from my own personal experience,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   and I'm just gonna be honest with you.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   Like, I just wanna be real with you.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   I don't wanna play games with you guys ever, okay?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   So sometimes, it's like, "Man, you can't tell single."
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   I'm like, "Man, I'm just gonna be honest with them.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   "If that's cool, like,
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   "we're just gonna have an honest conversation."
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   So the season that Monica and I are in
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   is, you know, we have three kids and a baby at home,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   and so she's nursing, and so that really changes things
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   when you're on the schedule every two hours.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   You know, you use your body to feed this baby.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   And so we don't get out a lot,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   like, as far as dates in this season.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   And so the other day, we had a date,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   and so it was great.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   Like, she was like, "Hey, pick me up at seven."
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   It's just fun to date my wife.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   Like, I'm crazy in love with her,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   and we love each other, and our marriage,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   our relationship is the best it's ever been today,
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   and even in these difficult seasons of raising an infant.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   And she's like, "Pick me up at seven,
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   "and hey, you play in the night."
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   And I'm like, "God, that's my love language."
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   Like, I love doing that stuff.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   And so I play in the night, and I'm thinking,
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   I don't wanna just take her to a movie.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360]   You know, so I call John McGee,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   who's our marriage pastor here,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   and I'm like, "Hey, give me your best idea."
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   And he's like, "Man, you could get a hotel,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   "you know, for like a couple hours."
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   And I'm like, (audience laughing)
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   "John, I like the way you think, bro.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   "That's a good idea."
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   And so I didn't really, you know, so I did.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   And so we go to dinner, you know,
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   and I just went on the app, the iPhone app,
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   and I just, here's what I was thinking,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   you know, we'll go up there,
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   and we like to watch movies in bed,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   and so we'll do that, and we'll see where that goes.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   And, just being real.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   And so, we have dinner, and she's like,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   "Okay, where are we going now?
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   "You know, movie, what time's the movie starting?"
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   And I'm like, "Well,"
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   and I didn't think this transition was the hard part.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   I'm like, "Well, I got a hotel room."
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   She's like, "Where are we really going?"
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   I was like, "A hotel room."
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   And so we did, right?
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   We go up there, and we watch our movie,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   and have our fun, you know?
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   And we're on our way home, and we're just talking.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   And she's just, you know,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   her parents are watching the kids,
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   and she's just like, "Yeah, you know,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   "I know that we're supposed to be free in that,
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   "but it just feels wrong because of the things
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   "that we did before we were married.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   "Like, I can't fully enjoy that with you in that way."
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.360]   And just like, to walk up into that hotel room,
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   it just causes me to reminisce from those times
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   before we were married,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   and so I just don't feel the freedom in that.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   And to be totally transparent with you,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   I feel that same bondage, some of that same baggage
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   that I think God is working on, you know,
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   and we have an amazing relationship,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360]   an amazing sex life,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.360]   but there's still bondage there and baggage.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   And we've been married almost nine years.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   My other friend that I talked to,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   he has a great marriage as well,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   and he just said, "You know, there's positions
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   "that we can't enjoy because of pornography
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   "that I looked at before we were married."
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   And it just doesn't feel safe.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   If we were to do the deed like that,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   it opens up this kind of Pandora's box in me
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   to sin, where I'm open to sin,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   and it's just not safe.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   And so his words, you know,
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.360]   "Our sex life is kind of vanilla
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   "because my sex life outside of my marriage
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   "was so not vanilla."
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   And so you don't ever think about that.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   You don't ever think about that.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   If I enjoy these things outside of that context,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   then inside that context, it's no longer safe.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   But that's what happens.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.360]   I see it every day.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.360]   And so at the risk of you thinking,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.360]   "Well, that's just your story, JP,"
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   keep in mind, I meet with hundreds of couples
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   that share those same very things to me.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   Some of them are like, "Hey, we can't even have sex.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   "Like, sex is off limits for us because of the things.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   "Like, we're just not there yet.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   "God's working in our lives."
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   And you think, "Marriage?
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   "You can't have sex?
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   "That's crazy."
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   I meet with them.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   But I want you to know
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   that that's not even the best reason not to have sex.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   He says, "Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food."
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   You know, if it feels good, do it.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.360]   But I want to ask you right now,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   I want to ask you right now,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   is pleasure the ultimate goal for you?
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   Because I heard a pastor friend,
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   and I've said this before,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   and people hate when I say it,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   but I'll say it again.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   I had a pastor friend say this,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   and it resonated with me.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   He just said, "A good reason not to have sex is
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   "if, you know, on a one to 10 scale,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.360]   "sex before marriage is a 12."
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   Let me say it again, in case you missed it.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   He said, "A good reason not to have sex before you're married
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   "because it's on a one to 10 scale,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   "sex before marriage is a 12."
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   All right?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   Now let me explain.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   Okay, is pleasure the ultimate?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   And he's talking about pleasure.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.360]   I believe that God's best sex occurs
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   in the context of marriage between a man and a woman.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   Okay, I absolutely believe that.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   But we're talking sheer pleasure.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   He said, "On a pleasure scale, it is a 12."
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   Why?
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   Here's the deal.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   Is pleasure the ultimate goal?
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   Because if it is, and I just want to be real truthful with you,
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   and this is not safe, me saying this,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   is you can leave here,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   and you can have any kind of sex you want.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   Okay?
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   Even in Dallas, you can get prostitution,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360]   you can get one or two, a couple hundred dollars,
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   and every kind of sex that you could possibly desire
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   is available to you right now.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   If it's just about pleasure.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   And this is why affairs happen, because people chase pleasure,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.360]   because, hey, sex with your wife is pretty good,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   but then sex with your neighbor's wife,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.360]   you know, there's a fear element to it,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   and when you're fearful, your senses increase.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   Okay?
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   Your pupils dilate.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   Your sensitive of touch is much more heightened.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   And so people do that stuff.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   They chase the pleasure.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   Is pleasure ultimate?
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   You need to decide right now.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   Is it about me experiencing the most pleasure I possibly can?
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.360]   Because if it is, I hear cocaine's pretty good,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   heroin's pretty good, ecstasy, all of, you know,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   a drug that releases all of your serotonin at one time,
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   that must be pretty amazing.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   Hey, crystal meth must be ridiculous,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   because people give their lives to it.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.360]   They chase that pleasure.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Have you ever seen someone that gets addicted to the pleasure of crystal meth,
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   and they chase it, and they chase it,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   and they chase it until their entire life is wrung out?
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   I'll show you a picture.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   And it's just as sloppy.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   When you chase the pleasure of sex,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   and you try to keep it from its purpose,
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   it causes similar consequences in your life.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   Right?
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   And we've got to get that.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   We've got to decide right now, hey, it's not about me trying to experience
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   the most sloppy pleasure I possibly can.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   It's about me believing there's a God who created the heavens and the earth
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   and has a plan for me,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   and that there's a pleasure with him that is greater than any other pleasure known to man,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   and that I'm going to get to enjoy that pleasure forever and ever and ever in eternity with him.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   You've got to believe that right here.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   If not, you'll leave here and you'll chase pleasure.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   You'll chase feelings.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   You'll chase your heart.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   See, the pleasure serves a purpose.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   And so you say, man, crystal meth, yeah, that's one thing,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   but sex, like really, it is rewiring our culture.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   You've got to know that.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   I just want you to think about this logically.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   Okay, just use your brain.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   It is rewiring our culture.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   I'll read something to you.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.360]   This is from Philip Zimbardo.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   He's the former president of the American Psychological Association.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   He says this.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   Men, this is to you.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   "We are seeking a steady increase among males in social awkwardness."
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   "We are seeing a steady increase among males in social awkwardness."
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   "The old kind of social awkwardness was a fear of rejection."
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.360]   "However, this is a new kind of social awkwardness, like you're a stranger in a foreign land."
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   "They don't know what to say and what to do, especially in one-on-one with the opposite sex."
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   "They don't know the language of face-to-face interaction, the nonverbal and verbal set of rules"
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   "that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else and listen to somebody else."
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   "The problem is men now prefer a synchronistic Internet world"
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   "to spontaneous interaction in social relationships."
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   "What are the causes? Excessive Internet use and video gaming, porning as arousal addictions."
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   "They are becoming more addictive with more variety, competition, and video quality."
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.360]   "Men no longer know the difference between making love and doing porn."
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.360]   "The average boy watches 50 porn clips a week."
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:47.360]   "Boys' brains are being digitally rewired for change, novelty, excitement, and constant arousal."
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   "Well, guys aren't asking girls out anymore."
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   That's why.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:01.360]   Man, I was with him and it was just weird. He didn't even know how to talk to me.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.360]   There's your explanation.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.360]   It's not just a male problem, we know that.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   One in three porn viewers are women, we know that.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.360]   And so you've got to decide, are you chasing some fleeting worldly pleasure?
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   And you're making that the ultimate goal, or is God the ultimate goal?
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   The Scripture says, "Being one with Him in spirit."
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   See, sexual immorality is a barricade to you being one with Him in spirit.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   Let me say it like this, you cannot have any sort of sexual pleasure outside of marriage and grow closer to God.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   You can't do it. It is impossible.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   No one has ever pursued sexual pleasure outside of the context of marriage and grown closer to God.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   Sex is an act of worship in marriage.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   That's why the enemy comes after it so badly.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   It is an act of worship. The enemy hates you worshipping.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.360]   And so he comes after it. That's why he distracts you when we're singing songs.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   And he says, "Hey, I want you to abuse this thing that God created that's good.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   And I want to twist it in your life so that you will never enjoy it as it should be.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   You may experience some fleeting pleasure, but you'll also experience some incredible heartbreak, loss, and hurts.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   The greatest reason for you not to have sex is not to avoid STDs.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   It's not even for you to avoid consequences in your marriage.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   It is for you to understand you will never be or experience the intimacy with God as He's intended if you are pursuing that."
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   He says, verse 18, "Flee." That's why he says it.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   "Flee from sexual immorality. All of the sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his body."
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   My second point is this. This is crazy, okay?
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   Purity is possible. You tracking with me?
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   Purity is possible. It is possible.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.360]   If you're here and you're a virgin, okay, maybe you feel weird or strange.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.360]   And I'm just saying, hey, you are the fortunate one, okay?
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   You can't sit there and be like, man, I'm crazy because I watched, you know, 40-year-old virgin and feel stupid.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.360]   No, you are the blessed one.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.360]   The scripture says, I trade you places.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   Okay, no regrets? That's foolish.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   I've got regrets.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   Man, purity is possible.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   Paul is saying that all sin is outside the body, but this one specific sin is not only outside the body, but it is also against your own body.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.360]   So your command is to flee it.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   Flee the pursuit of any sexual pleasure outside of marriage.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   Don't tap it. Don't look at it and kick it a little bit.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   You know, don't go up and get a close view. You run.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   He says, flee from it.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   And what he's saying that to the church in Corinth is he's telling you it's possible.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   It is possible for you to avoid it.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   It is possible for you to be having indulged in it and then stop indulging in it.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   That's what was going on in Corinth.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.360]   He's saying, hey, no longer should you indulge in this thing.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   Stop it completely. Completely cut it out.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   I'll tell you, it is possible.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   I've done several marriages where they waited.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   And it's always interesting, like the criticism they received.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   I've done a few marriages where the couple waited to kiss until the altar.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   And the world always says that's stupid.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   They're like, that's so stupid.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   I'm like, you've been divorced three times.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   Like, they're happily married. Like, how stupid is it?
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   You know, that's so--they waited to kiss until the altar. That's so dumb.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   I'm like, they got the happy marriage, you know.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   It seems like they might have something figured out.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.360]   I'm not even prescribing that. I'm just telling you, couples have done it.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   I say that to give you hope. You can do it.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.360]   You can avoid sexual immorality.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   1 Corinthians 10:13 says, "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   And God is faithful. God is faithful.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   And when you are, He will provide a way out so that you can stand under it."
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.360]   He's a good God.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   The temptation that you experience, that you face, it's common to humanity.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   It was common to the church in Corinth. It's common to the church in Dallas.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   It's been common throughout the beginning of the world, starting in the Garden of Eden.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   It is common temptation. And you can win with the strength of the Spirit.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   And so the lie is that everybody's having sex.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   I don't know, maybe everybody is having sex.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   But they're not winning.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   They're not getting ahead.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   And it is hurting them.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   So, if you don't do it, you're going to be okay.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   Did you guys hear about that lady that actually died from not having sex?
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   Of course you didn't, because it never happened, okay?
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   It's never happened. No one has ever died.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   It's not like food, you know, like, "Oh no, man.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   What's the remedy?" No, listen.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   It's never happened, okay?
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   If you don't eat, you might die, right?
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   You don't drink, you might die.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   But if you don't have sex, you're going to be just fine.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.360]   Did you know that Jesus didn't have sex?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   Did you know that?
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.360]   He seemed to make it.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.360]   Jesus lived the most fulfilled life anyone has ever lived.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   No one in the history of humanity has lived a more full life than Jesus Christ.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.360]   He was a virgin.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   Okay? It's going to be okay.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.360]   Like, no one gets up there and is like, "Man, I wish I had more sex."
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   You know, it's not going to happen.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   You've been brainwashed.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   Like, society has told you it's ultimate.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   And it's not ultimate.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   God's ultimate.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   Your relationship with God is ultimate.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   And so we play this silly game of like, "Hey, can I, you know, what can I do this?
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   What can I do that?
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   What about that?
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   What about this kind of sex?
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Is this okay?"
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360]   You know?
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.360]   I had this -- there was a group of us pastors talking about masturbation one time.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   And we were just like, "Hey, is there any -- you know, is it okay?"
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   You know, this and that.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   And one guy just gave this really wise advice that stayed with me.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   He just said, "Yeah, man, do it.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   Do it and be right before the Lord.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   Stand free from conviction.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   Feel good about it.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.360]   Be free.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   Unless you can't, then don't."
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.360]   That simple advice.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   You get it?
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   Like, he says, "Hey, you be free in your pursuit of sexual pleasure outside of marriage.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   And you feel good about it and be confident about it.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   Unless you can't, then don't."
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   He's a wise man.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   He knew you couldn't if you had the Holy Spirit in you, right?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   He knows that the Holy Spirit is going to convict your heart.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   He knows you feel dirty afterwards.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   And God doesn't want you to feel dirty.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   God doesn't want you to feel bad.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   God wants you to walk in the freedom that he's created you to walk in.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   There's discipline there.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   You know, there's strength that you have to draw from him there.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   There's difficulties there.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   But God desires freedom for you because he loves you.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   He's crazy about you.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   My friend was a wise man.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   You have the Spirit of God in you.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   That's the crazy thing about this that I just want to make sure you know.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   Like, God's not trying to rip you off, man.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   He's not trying to keep you from pleasure.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   He's not trying to keep you from something that's ultimately going to lead to life.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.360]   He's trying to give you life to the fullest.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   Can I just show you that statistically?
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   I told you I really want to attack these issues, not just scripturally.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   But I know there's a lot of you here that don't submit to the Bible as truth or don't have a relationship with Christ.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   So let me just throw some secular data at you.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   The divorce rate in the United States of America is 52%.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   So 52% of all couples who get married today, we talked about the decreasing marriage rate.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.360]   52%, so most couples who get married today will not make it.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   And that's the truth in the church.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   So most of you, and a lot of you, divorce is a part of your story.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   And we're going to talk about that at some point.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.360]   And so I'm glad you're here.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   Like, welcome.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   We're stoked you're here.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   So 52% of marriages that start end.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   We know that.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   That's secular data.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   Matter of fact.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   Did you know that 9% of virgins who marry get divorced?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   It goes from 52% to 9%.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   Do you think God knew what he was talking about when he created this bonding agent?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   Did you know that you personally, like not even your spouse, but if you personally wait until you're married,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:29.360]   the probability of you getting a divorce decreases by 70%.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   So 52% decreases by 70%.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   How incredible is that?
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   Do you think God knew what he was talking about?
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   This is secular data as a matter of fact.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   And the world is like, that's so stupid.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   It's like, no, man, that's always what the world says.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   That's so dumb.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   No, I don't know if you've read this thing, but God kind of knows what he's talking about.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   He made everything, including sex.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   It's crazy.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   And so why is purity even important?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   Let's go, 19.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit?
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   See, also God who is in you, whom you have received from God.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   You are not your own.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   You were bought at a price.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Therefore, honor God with your body.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   Paul writes the church at Corinth and says, hey, you think that body, that thing that you're controlling,
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   that thing that you're giving to other people, that thing that you're yoking to other folks,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   you think it belongs to you?
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   It doesn't belong to you.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.360]   You better ask the person that it belongs to before you use it in those ways, right?
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   Like the other day, I got this sprayer, this paint sprayer at my house that I borrowed from a friend.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.360]   So I borrowed a paint sprayer.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   Another friend comes over, sees it at my house, and says, hey, can I borrow that or can I have that?
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   And I'm like, well, it's not mine.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   You've got to ask who it belongs to.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   So the next time he propositions you for sex, you stop right there and say,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   I just need to ask God's permission real quick.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   It will kill the mood right there, okay?
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.360]   Next time she says, hey, let's go back there, let's go to my apartment,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   you say, well, hold on, let's pray about it real quick.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   Let's seek God's approval.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   Your body belongs to him, man.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.360]   He bought it.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   This is the hope, man.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   You might have tattoos all over your face, all over your body.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   And God says, you're mine.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   He said, I'll purchase you.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   I'll do so with my life.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   I'll give my only begotten son.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   See, there's forgiveness.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   You might have scars.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   God will take them, man.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   God will take your scars.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   I don't care if you have hundreds of partners.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   God will make a pastor out of you.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   He'll make a missionary out of you.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   I'm not here to tell you you can be a virgin again, like that's silly.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   I'm not even here to tell you that you can avoid earthly consequences, also silly.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   You cannot sin and avoid the consequence, okay.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.360]   You just can't do it.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   It's impossible.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   But you can avoid the eternal consequences.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   You can.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   Like God will take you in like you are his son and daughter and he will not see the sex on you.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   He will see you as Christ.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   Romans 8, 1, there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.360]   I will tell you today that God will take you like he will claim you as his own.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   It's interesting to me that our culture, the society that we live in are so unbelievably forgiving.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   Like they are very, very forgiving, okay.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   You just, you can watch the Grammys and see Chris Brown and Rihanna and just like the way that we just embrace, like hey, like nothing happened, you know.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Like we're really forgiving.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   Tiger Woods, okay.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   Bill Clinton, a president who had an affair in office is now saying the prayer, you know, for our current president.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.360]   So, really, really forgiving culture.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Charlie Sheen, you know, we'll put him back on a hit TV sitcom.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   We'll take Michael Vick and put him back in the NFL.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   We're very forgiving as a couple.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   Just wait for it with Lance Armstrong.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   He'll have another commercial I bet.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   I'm just guessing.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   That's not a prophecy or anything.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   I'm just guessing.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   Society is incredibly forgiving.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   Why are they so forgiving?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   Because they don't want to tell anybody that they're wrong.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   Because then it gives permission for others to say that they're wrong.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   So, the more they can say, hey, it's all okay.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   Like, hey, it's okay.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   I know you did that, but you slept with all those women.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   It's okay.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   You know, we'll forgive you.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   We'll put you back.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   We'll worship you again.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   I know you beat her up, Chris, but we'll worship you again.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   You know, really forgiving.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   Because society says do what feels good.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Like that's the kind of banner cry.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   You do whatever feels good.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   You should chase pleasure.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   And they don't realize that pleasure, the pursuit of pleasure can leave you completely wrung out.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   There's consequences to it.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   This is what I want you to hear me.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   There is no one more forgiving than Jesus Christ.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   There is no one more forgiving than Jesus.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   Jesus takes you in and he makes you new.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   It's okay.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   Like he takes you and he cleans you up.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   You know, he cleans you up and he makes you his.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   He claims you as his own.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   And you don't have to walk around with guilt.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   Like you can use your story then as a testimony to set others free.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   I see that all the time.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   Like girls who had an abortion and all of a sudden they walk away with this guilt.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   All of a sudden they understand that they're forgiven by the grace of Jesus.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   And then they walk around and say, "Hey, I had an abortion. Did you have one?"
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   "I want to help you."
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   "No, Christ has forgiven me. I don't wear it anymore. There's freedom. I can talk freely about it."
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   People are like, "Hey, how do you stand up there in front of thousands of people and talk about your porn addiction?"
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   "It doesn't own me! I'm free!"
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   "Wait, what?"
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   "Yeah, there's some consequences. Like I got all these pictures in my head every now and then."
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   "But Jesus is bigger!"
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   "Amen! He's bigger!"
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   He can do it for you.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   I'm not crazy. I haven't lost my mind.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   He can take you, clean you up, and make you his.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   He'll claim you as his own.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.360]   He'll say, "She's mine."
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   "She's not that prostitute. She's mine."
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.360]   "She's not that girl."
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   "She's mine."
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   "And don't you dare call her anything but mine."
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   That's the message of Jesus.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   That's why, if you walk around as a follower of Jesus Christ, guilty, you're saying that the gospel is not enough.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Do you understand?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   Can I show you what he paid for?
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   I saw a lot of pictures tonight.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   Can I show you one more?
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   Show you the tattoos that Jesus wore to pay for your sins.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   I think we have a picture of him paying the price for your sins.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   Everything.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   The stuff you looked at on your computer.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   The things you've seen.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.360]   The things you did.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   That time in college, you did the walk of shame.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   They even call it the walk of shame.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   They know it's no good.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   I'll carry it.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   I'll carry it.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   I'll wear it. You put it on me.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   I don't care if you've got a tattoo right across your forehead.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   I'm enough.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   And so Paul writes, "Honor God with your body."
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   You see that fleeing from sexual immorality can be difficult until you're running towards God.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   If you're chasing God, it's easy to run from sin.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.360]   In fact, it's the easiest way to run from sin is to run with all of your might and all of your strength
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   toward the one who gave you life and made you new and gave you purpose.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   You're going to die soon, and you're going to be with him forever and ever and ever
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   if you've trusted in his provision through Jesus Christ.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   See, what happened with that picture is Jesus was taking all of your sin, all himself.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   It crushed him. It killed God.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   Crazy.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   Put in a grave, and three days later, just a flex on the enemy.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.360]   He said, "Hey, I'm alive again."
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   But Jesus wore scars.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Jesus has tattoos, right?
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   He's got scars in his hands.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   He's saying, "Hey, this is evidence of what I've done for you."
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   "Thomas, come here. Put your finger in this hole in my hand."
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:20.360]   "It's evidence of what I paid for you to walk in the freedom and the grace that I've extended to you."
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   "Sex is powerful. Purity is possible. And your body is priceless."
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   "You've been bought with Jesus."
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.360]   And so if a guy wanted to give you a tattoo across your face,
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   you met him, and you love him head over heels, and he's like, "Hey, here's what I want to do, okay?"
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   "I'm going to take it, and we're going to put my name all across your face."
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   You're going to run. You're going to be like, "That's crazy. I'm not going to do that."
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.360]   But if someone was willing to ask you to betray God's call on your life,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.360]   why would we be willing to do that?
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.360]   It's interesting because I've just kind of been in this funk all week
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   because I read this article about sex in high school.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.360]   I talked to a bunch of high school kids this weekend, and I was reading this article.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.360]   It was about sexting and just the crazy problems.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   I don't know if you all heard about that girl that died, but there was a guy that recorded her giving him oral sex,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   and he passed it around to the school, and she threatened to kill herself.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   And when she did, she slipped and fell to her death.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   And so it made big news and just really sad stuff in this article.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   And so I've just kind of been carrying that around this week.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   And one thing that the article said is it said that what girls are doing now in high school is the guy will say,
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   "Hey, I want you to write my name on your body and take a picture."
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   And then these guys are collecting these pictures of girls with their names on their body and passing them around,
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   trading them like trading cards.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.360]   I'm just like, "Man, culture is so corrupt. They don't get it."
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   You know, I didn't get it.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   And so these guys are saying, "Hey, write your name so they can see your mind."
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:10.360]   This guy, you know, to this girl, Alessia, he says, "Hey, let's write my name across your face so that the world can see that you're mine."
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   You're his.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   You get that?
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   It's not your scars.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   It's not your tattoos.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   It's not what you've done.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   It's what he did.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   You're his.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   You belong to him.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   And I know, like, there's some ladies here, and you're like, "Man, JP, you don't get it.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   Like, these guys, like, they won't -- unless I'm showing off my body or giving it away, like, these guys won't give me the time of day."
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   And I get it.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   Like, we did that experiment the first night.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   Like, "Hey, guys, find the godliest girl you know and ask her out."
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   And I know that that builds insecurities.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   Like, I am no idiot.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   Like, I understand.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.360]   I'm like, "Well, you know, if no one asks me out, does that mean I'm not godly?
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   What's wrong with me?
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   And how do they know I'm godly?"
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   You know, I get it, girls.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.360]   I get it.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   Okay?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   And so you're there.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   You're like, "Hey, I don't -- but there's no good guys."
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.360]   What if that's true?
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   What if there are no good guys?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   What if there's not one?
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   Let's just say for a second, what if that's true?
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   What are you going to do?
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   You've got to choose now.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   You okay with that?
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Because girls tell you all the time, "I know God has someone for me."
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   Maybe.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   I hope so.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   I'll pray that for you.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   Guys say, too, "I know God has someone for me."
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   Maybe he does.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   What if you don't meet him?
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   Are you okay?
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   Is God ultimate in your life?
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   Is he big enough?
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   You're going to be -- no one's up there like, "Man, I can't believe I didn't get to experience that one thing."
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   No one has ever said that up there.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.360]   No one.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   And so for some of you, the sexual immorality that you've got to flee from -- and this is some of you, not all of you -- is your relationship.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360]   You know it.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   You're here, and you're like, "You might be right here.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   You might be here together.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   It's super awkward right now."
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   But the sexual immorality that you've got to run from is letting him go, letting her go.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   I'm going to ask my friend Jenny Simmons to come up, and she's going to sing a song that she wrote.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   And it's just -- here is what I want to tell you is you can trust God.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.360]   Like if you heard me say one thing, okay, like there's a God.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.360]   He's real.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   He's purchased you with the blood of Jesus.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   It happened 2013 years ago in the greatest event the world has ever seen or ever known.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   They don't even know what to do with it.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   It changed time.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   His birth did anyways.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   And you're going to be with him forever if you've trusted in him for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   Not walking around guilty, but you've trusted in Christ.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   I believe in Jesus.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   He died for me, and I'm free.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   I've been set free.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   Okay.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   He's enough, and you can trust him.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   Let me pray.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Father, help us to let go what we need to.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   Whatever that is in our lives, what we're pursuing instead of you, Father, I pray you
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   take it, rip it apart from us if you need to.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   Thank you for your mercy and your grace and the forgiveness of sins and the new life that
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   you extend to us.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   Father, comfort the afflicted, those ridden with guilt right now.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   I pray that you and your mercy by the power of your spirit would love them and hug them
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   and restore them and renew them.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   Father, thank you for the promise of 1 Corinthians 10:13, just that no temptation has seized us
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   except what is common, and that you're faithful and that you give us freedom.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.360]   Amen.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:47.360]   Amen.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   Amen.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
