 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:19,720
 Good evening.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,760
 Oh, man, it's going to be a long night.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,080
 We have any dog lovers here?

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,480
 [CHEERING]

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,400
 Come on, man.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,320
 Big representative.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,200
 Any cat lovers?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
 [CHEERING]

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
 All right, we'll pray for you.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,480
 [LAUGHTER]

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,880
 It felt like y'all sat together.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
 Did y'all meet here, like all the cat lovers have a big sign?

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,360
 You probably saw a blue and black dress, too.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 I get it, man.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
 Glad you're here.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,160
 I had two dogs growing up, not at the same time,

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 but as I reflect back on my childhood,

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,080
 I think about these two dogs that we

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,240
 had at different seasons growing up, one and then the other.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,480
 Their names were Zach and Max.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,280
 And Zach was a black lab.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,120
 I bought him from my uncle for a nickel.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,320
 And it's true what they say, man's best friend, right?

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
 And so just as a kid, this black lab was so good.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
 And we would like taught him tricks.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
 He could sit, and he could actually--

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,520
 we had this tree in our backyard he could climb.

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
 True story for you cat lovers.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,240
 My dog could climb a tree.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
 And so he was a good dog, except one thing.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,520
 There was one command that he didn't learn,

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,040
 and that was stay here.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,400
 I grew up on 20 acres on the Guadalupe River,

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,160
 on the farm, in the country.

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,120
 It was puppy paradise, right?

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,240
 And all he needed to do-- we fed him, and we were good to him.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,680
 All he needed to do was stay on the farm,

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,640
 except for he would constantly wander.

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,440
 Like he would go on the neighbor's property,

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,160
 and he would just wander all throughout this kind of area

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,880
 that we lived in.

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
 And there was a highway near there.

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,960
 I was always afraid he was going to get hit by a semi truck.

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,760
 And so he would just-- he would constantly wander off.

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,680
 And I'd be like, Zach, you've got to come home.

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,200
 Come home.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,720
 Stay home.

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,240
 Stay here.

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
 I would walk him around the perimeter of the house.

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
 I'm like, don't cross the barbed wire fence.

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,840
 You've got to stay on our property.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,680
 And we would call him, and he would eventually come back.

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
 When he would hear, we'd honk the horn.

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,440
 And he would eventually come back.

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,680
 But he would always wander off.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
 It was like he wasn't satisfied with us being his master.

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
 Even though we gave him good things,

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,880
 he was always looking for something else.

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
 And one day, we couldn't find him.

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,800
 One day, we honked the horn, and he didn't come home.

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 And so we went out looking for him.

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,280
 And we found him.

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
 He had been shot.

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
 Yeah.

66
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,440
 It's gangster inquiry, man.

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,720
 You've got to-- it's just the way they do.

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,000
 Somebody shot my dog.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,480
 OK?

70
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,640
 And if you're here, I want-- no.

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,320
 And so it was just this crazy thing.

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,280
 And I think about that, and it's like, man,

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,040
 if he would have just stayed on the farm like I told him to.

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
 I wanted to give him good things,

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,480
 but he constantly wandered off.

76
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,520
 And we found him, and he was dead.

77
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,720
 And then we got this other dog, Max, to replace him.

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,040
 Max was a lab Rottweiler cross, and also a great dog.

79
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,160
 Taught him incredible tricks, and he obeyed.

80
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,680
 And Max was completely content on the farm.

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,920
 In fact, he never would cross the property line.

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,400
 It was like God knew what we needed.

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,720
 And he was a great dog.

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,080
 And one day, we took him hunting to this other property

85
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,760
 that we had, where we had some cows, some cattle.

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
 And it was about seven miles away

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
 on the other side of the river.

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,240
 And my dad pulled out a rifle and shot the rifle.

89
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,040
 He was sighting it in.

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,960
 If you're a hunter, you know what that means.

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
 And he shot the rifle.

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,440
 Well, Max, our dog, had never heard a rifle.

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,000
 And he hears that gun, and he just takes off and keeps going.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,760
 Like Forrest Gump style, keeps going and going.

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,360
 And I'm like, come back, Max.

96
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
 Hey, come-- OK, funny joke.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,520
 Come-- and he just disappears in the tree line.

98
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560
 And I'm like, what?

99
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,440
 And so we looked for him for hours

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,240
 until the sun set, went home, went to school the next day,

101
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,920
 went back out there, drove back seven miles away

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,600
 to that little farmland where we had cattle, looked for him,

103
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 started knocking on neighbors' doors,

104
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
 like just going up and showing them, have you seen my dog?

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
 They're like, yeah, I saw him walking around.

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,120
 And I was like putting the story together.

107
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,640
 Well, what date, when did you see him, what time?

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,240
 Have you seen him?

109
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,960
 Yeah, we saw him.

110
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,160
 We were wondering who's dog it was.

111
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,720
 Thought it was a stray.

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,440
 It's not a stray.

113
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,760
 It's my dog.

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,440
 Where is he?

115
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,120
 Oh, I don't know.

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,880
 He wandered off.

117
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
 And so we did that for six days.

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,840
 We looked for him.

119
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,520
 Six days, we drove out there seven miles away,

120
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,640
 the other side of the river.

121
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,880
 And on the sixth day of doing this,

122
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,800
 every single day after school, we come back home.

123
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,080
 We get back to my house.

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,920
 And there he is sitting in the driveway.

125
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
 He had traveled-- homeward bound, man.

126
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,340
 He had traveled seven miles and swam the river.

127
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,680
 He was all wet.

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
 He had swam the river to get back on the property.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,640
 He did whatever it took to come back to his master.

130
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,360
 And I tell you that tonight because the church in Colossae,

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,160
 the church that Paul is writing to, the Colossians,

132
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,240
 they have strayed away from home.

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,400
 They have been distracted.

134
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,560
 They've been looking for another master.

135
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 They've been looking for Jesus plus something else.

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,800
 There's got to be another way.

137
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
 Is there any other philosophy out there?

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,360
 Is there anything else that we can achieve this higher

139
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,920
 learning?

140
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,000
 Is there some other idea?

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And they've wandered off.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,600
 And Paul, in this letter, is calling them home.

143
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,360
 He's saying, come home.

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,680
 Come back to your one true master, Jesus Christ.

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
 And I say that to you tonight because every one of us

146
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,720
 is like one of those dogs, a Zachary Max.

147
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
 We're wandering through Dallas or Fort Worth.

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,600
 And we're looking in bars and in clubs.

149
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,280
 We're looking in stores and in malls.

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,240
 We're looking at jobs and in schools.

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,880
 And we're trying to find some master that's going to satisfy.

152
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,040
 We're dating guys.

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
 We're looking on Tinder.

154
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,680
 We're looking different places, hoping

155
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,720
 to find some master whom we can come under.

156
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,880
 And they're going to take care of us.

157
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
 They're going to feed us.

158
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,960
 They're going to fill this void in our lives and satisfy us.

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
 And God, through this letter, is saying, come home.

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,720
 Will you return back to the one true master, the one whom

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'm sent into your world to call you home?

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,560
 The one who died for you.

163
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,880
 The one who defeated death.

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,640
 We celebrated this past Sunday on Easter for you.

165
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's a perfect master.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Perfect master.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,880
 That's an incredible master.

168
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,240
 And so he's saying, hey, let's go back to the basics.

169
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,120
 In Colossians chapter 2, if you have your Bibles,

170
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 you can turn there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,

171
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,360
 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,

172
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
 and the book of Colossians.

173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,200
 Colossians chapter 2.

174
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,600
 In verse 6, he says, David said last week,

175
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
 I caught on this, so then just as you receive Christ Jesus

176
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,960
 as Lord, continue to live your lives in him.

177
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,560
 He says, grow in Christ the same way you came to him.

178
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,200
 Through dependence, we say at the porch often,

179
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,280
 all you need is need.

180
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
 If you're here, you're a visitor with us,

181
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,080
 and you're wondering, hey, what do I need to be a Christian?

182
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
 You need need.

183
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,520
 You need to be in a place where you know you're a sinner

184
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,600
 and you need a savior.

185
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,880
 You need someone other than you, a perfect God,

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
 to save you from your sins.

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
 All you need is need.

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,240
 You grow in Christ the same way you came to him.

189
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,680
 If you're here and you're a mature believer,

190
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,040
 you know the scriptures, you've been in church

191
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,800
 for a long time, you love Jesus, what do you need?

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
 You need need as well.

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
 You need to wake up and realize that you're desperate

194
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,520
 for the gospel because you're a sinner.

195
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,680
 And though while God made you a saint through Christ,

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,440
 prone to wonder, Lord, I feel it,

197
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,880
 prone to leave the God I love.

198
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,960
 Call me home through the gospel.

199
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,160
 And so tonight we're gonna talk about what it looks like

200
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,120
 to be rooted in Jesus, to be tied up.

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
 Like sometimes we'd have to tie Zach up

202
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
 so that he wouldn't wonder, to be tied to Jesus,

203
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,000
 rooted deeply in Jesus with Christ as the foundation.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,640
 We're gonna look at what it looks like,

205
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,280
 how Jesus, in Jesus, our stance is strengthened,

206
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,920
 how in Jesus our searching is satisfied,

207
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,840
 and how in Jesus our sin nature is severed.

208
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,920
 Colossians chapter two, starting in verse seven.

209
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,880
 At the end of six he says,

210
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,640
 "Continue to live your lives in him, Jesus,

211
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,780
 "rooted and built up in him, Jesus,

212
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,640
 "strengthened in the faith you were taught

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
 "and overflowing with thankfulness."

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
 Rooted in Jesus, rooted in Christ.

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,840
 "See to it that no one takes you captive

216
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,200
 "through hollow and deceptive philosophies,

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,660
 "which depends on human tradition

218
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,820
 "and elemental spiritual forces of this world

219
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,880
 "rather than on Christ."

220
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 See to it that no one takes you captive with worldly ideas.

221
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,640
 I just got back last week, I was on,

222
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,960
 it was in Austin, Greg and I went down to UT

223
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,280
 and we were doing evangelism on the campus

224
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
 and then we'd preach a message that night

225
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,120
 and there'd be worship, it was like a porch gathering.

226
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,280
 They're on the campus outside.

227
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,720
 And as we would engage with people who would walk by,

228
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,680
 if you know anything about UT, very liberal campus.

229
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,960
 And as we would engage with people,

230
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
 they were fine with Jesus.

231
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,440
 Yeah, Jesus, that's neat.

232
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,720
 But then they would come

233
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,240
 with some superior worldly knowledge.

234
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,480
 It was interesting to me how confident they were.

235
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,680
 Like there I am, like hey, I'd love to talk to you

236
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,520
 about God.

237
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,120
 It's like, well, you can't possibly know God.

238
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,000
 It's like, well, you can't possibly know who I know.

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,360
 You know, it's like, hey, let's talk about that, right?

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,480
 And he's like, you know, no, I'm great with Jesus,

241
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,840
 but I mean, you can't tell me he's the only way.

242
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,880
 He said he was the only way.

243
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,520
 The Jesus that you're fine with, you know,

244
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,760
 said I am the way, the truth, and the life.

245
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,380
 No one gets to the Father except through me.

246
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,960
 I am the gate.

247
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
 Wide is the road that leads to destruction,

248
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
 narrow is the gate that leads to life,

249
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
 and few will find.

250
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,040
 You know, he said these words, right?

251
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
 The one whom you're fine with, you know,

252
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,920
 it's written and read in a historical book

253
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,600
 that talks about his life.

254
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,560
 A biography of him says that he said that.

255
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,760
 Are you okay with that?

256
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,440
 And they would come with these worldly concepts.

257
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,200
 You know, they had been taught by some professor

258
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,140
 some superior worldly wisdom.

259
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,480
 That's what's going on in Colossae here.

260
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,160
 We don't know exactly what, but it is apparent

261
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
 that they have been led astray by some heresy.

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,760
 Somebody has added something to Jesus.

263
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,800
 Okay, probably some form of work,

264
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,060
 and we believe some sort of angelic worship

265
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,360
 or worship of angels is going on.

266
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,780
 And so Paul is calling them home.

267
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,240
 You know what he's saying?

268
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,740
 He's like, hey, let's go back to the basics.

269
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,900
 That's what everyone tonight needs to hear.

270
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,640
 By calling you home, I'm saying, hey,

271
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,640
 can we just return to the fundamental gospel, the basics?

272
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,920
 I was raised Catholic, Catholic school for nine years.

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
 My wife, who I met in college

274
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,520
 when I was not walking with the Lord,

275
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,680
 was raised in the Church of Christian Science.

276
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
 And so we both had Jesus and some other ideas

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
 that we had been taught along the way.

278
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,680
 And we would argue, you know, our relationship as we dated,

279
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,160
 as pagans, would look like, you know,

280
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
 hey, our kids are gonna be Catholic.

281
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,440
 No, they're gonna be Church of Christian Science.

282
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,360
 No, that's crazy.

283
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,960
 You're not gonna be that, you know,

284
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,920
 wacko, be Catholic.

285
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,320
 And so that's what, it was healthy, you know?

286
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 And so we would have those arguments.

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
 And one day, if you've been here long,

288
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,240
 you've heard my story, I stumbled into this place,

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,880
 to Watermark, hung over, sat in the back row,

290
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,600
 I heard the gospel, and began to search for God

291
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
 and kept coming to Christ.

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,960
 And that led to a conversation in my car with Monica,

293
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
 who I was dating at the time,

294
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
 and I just said, hey, what do you believe?

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,680
 And in a moment of God's grace,

296
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,820
 we kind of put down our swords and just said,

297
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,660
 you know what?

298
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,320
 She goes, I remember it, and we talk about this often.

299
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,960
 She said, I believe in Jesus.

300
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,000
 I believe that God sent him to die for my sins

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,240
 and that God raised him from the dead.

302
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,640
 And I looked at her and I said, that's what I believe.

303
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 And I said, right now, that's all I'm sure about.

304
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,040
 Let's build on that.

305
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,400
 And we just began, we started going to church together,

306
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,120
 and we trusted in Christ together.

307
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
 It's interesting.

308
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,640
 And we grew in that reality.

309
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,200
 We said, let's just go back to the basics,

310
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,160
 the fundamental gospel.

311
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,680
 If I get distracted by a bunch of theology

312
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,540
 or a bunch of competing views,

313
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,440
 or what does it look like, you know, this or that,

314
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,520
 or soteriology or end times

315
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,760
 or whatever is distracting me at the time,

316
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,060
 sometimes I just gotta go back to the gospel.

317
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,920
 For God so loved the world

318
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
 that he gave his only begotten son

319
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,260
 that whoever believes in him shall not perish,

320
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,920
 but have eternal life.

321
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,000
 So my first point this evening from this text

322
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
 is Jesus strengthens our stance.

323
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,680
 Jesus strengthens our stance.

324
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,400
 Jesus is the foundation of your faith.

325
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,680
 Now, if you've done any kind of athletic sports,

326
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,040
 like in football, okay, they would say, widen your stance.

327
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,000
 You get a three-point stance, widen your base.

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,920
 Cheerleading, same thing.

329
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,760
 Basketball, you come down with a rebound,

330
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,580
 widen your stance.

331
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,280
 Karate, I can remember in martial arts,

332
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,620
 they say, hey, widen your stance

333
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,040
 so that you're not easily knocked over.

334
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,660
 Widen your base.

335
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,380
 Jesus strengthens your stance

336
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,320
 so that the forces of this world don't take you captive.

337
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,220
 You go back to Christ

338
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,100
 so that you're not distracted by the bar,

339
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,760
 by that girl on Tinder,

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,020
 by your job, by your desire for money,

341
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,800
 your desire for clothes, your desire for style, whatever.

342
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
 He strengthens your stance, widen your base,

343
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,180
 focus on the foundation.

344
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,040
 Jesus strengthens your stance.

345
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,400
 In Matthew 7, he says, you wanna be like a house

346
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,460
 built on a solid foundation

347
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,280
 of which Jesus is that foundation.

348
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,700
 Verse 25, he says, the rain came down

349
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,760
 and the streams rose and the winds blew

350
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,960
 and beat against that house,

351
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,800
 yet it did not fall because it was built on the rock.

352
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,360
 This scripture says rooted

353
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,840
 is the word it uses, like Psalm 1.

354
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,680
 It says, blessed is the man who delights

355
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,720
 in the law of the Lord.

356
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,480
 He or she is like a tree

357
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,180
 planted by streams of water

358
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,460
 with deep roots that go deep into the ground to hold it.

359
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,700
 The hurricane comes and the tree's not going anywhere.

360
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,100
 The storms of this life blow,

361
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,580
 but the tree stands firm

362
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,880
 because its roots are deep into the ground

363
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,300
 reaching for the source of life.

364
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
 Yields fruit in and out of season

365
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,260
 that you would be rooted in Christ.

366
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,940
 And then he says built up.

367
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,460
 Monica and I, our family just built a home.

368
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,140
 We moved into it on Thanksgiving.

369
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,200
 It was about a 13, 14 month process.

370
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,020
 And so many of those months were spent

371
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,300
 before anything ever went up.

372
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,860
 In fact, I took our team over there

373
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
 and we prayed just over the foundation of the house

374
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,740
 because it took months and months and months

375
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,900
 just to build the foundation.

376
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,300
 They took so much care into digging these deep holes

377
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
 and grooves in the ground

378
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,580
 and drilling deep into the bedrock

379
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,980
 and then putting these things in there called piers.

380
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,260
 And then on top of those piers

381
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,220
 being this building this concrete slab

382
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,020
 and in this slab was rebar and these steel beams

383
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,180
 to hold it together.

384
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,400
 There's the foundation, why?

385
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,740
 Because before this builder put anything up

386
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,100
 they wanted to make sure that it would stay,

387
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
 that it would hold true.

388
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,540
 And so before you go grabbing for theology

389
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,140
 and memory verses and learning the Bible

390
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,740
 you make sure you have the gospel,

391
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,340
 Christ at your foundation.

392
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,900
 He says or else when the winds blow it will crumble.

393
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 It will fall down.

394
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,780
 He says strengthened in the faith,

395
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,140
 I'm sorry, strengthened in the faith as you were taught.

396
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,140
 Strengthened in the faith as you were taught.

397
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,460
 Back to the basics.

398
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,460
 I hear this question a lot, every so often.

399
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,020
 Does the porch exist to reach non-believers,

400
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,900
 non-Christians to evangelize, to seek?

401
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,340
 Or does the porch exist to equip Christians, believers,

402
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,460
 to build in important to Christians?

403
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,220
 And the answer is, I wanna answer it for you

404
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,300
 so that you can answer it for others.

405
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,620
 The answer is yes.

406
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,100
 Okay?

407
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,960
 The porch exists to reach sinners.

408
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,700
 So the only people that should be in this room

409
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,140
 right now are sinners.

410
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,460
 If you're here and you're not a sinner, feel free to leave.

411
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,420
 You know, we may follow you frankly.

412
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,860
 All right, the only people here are sinners.

413
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,220
 We exist to reach sinners.

414
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,420
 Now who are sinners, right?

415
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,740
 If you're here and you have trusted in Christ

416
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,140
 and you've grown in the knowledge of the scriptures

417
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,100
 and you're seeking him, you desperately need the gospel

418
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,140
 to be reminded of the basics

419
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,540
 so that you don't turn to some religious acts

420
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,940
 or whatever you do for your own salvation,

421
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,380
 thinking that God loves you more

422
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,700
 because of the things you do.

423
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,820
 That flies in the face of the gospel.

424
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,540
 And so that you don't become self-righteous and legalistic,

425
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,500
 you on a regular basis, on a daily basis,

426
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,780
 must be reminded that God saved you

427
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,520
 in spite of you through Christ and the return to him.

428
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,940
 Now, if we brought you in off the corner

429
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,900
 where you were selling crack or selling yourself

430
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,500
 or anything else for that matter,

431
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,940
 and you don't know Christ and you're an atheist

432
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,580
 and you've rejected that or whatever,

433
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,180
 and I'm coming up with sins that for some reason

434
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,280
 we think are greater than our own

435
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,420
 because our theology's whack at times,

436
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,340
 but if you're here and you don't know God,

437
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,940
 you desperately need the gospel.

438
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,600
 So believing people who sin, saints who sin,

439
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,740
 and sinners both desperately need the gospel

440
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,660
 of which I hope we hold in front of you on a weekly basis

441
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,260
 so that you will be strengthened in the faith

442
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,360
 as you were taught.

443
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,000
 Ephesians 4, verse 13 and 14,

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,940
 it's almost a commentary on this passage

445
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,260
 or I'll say a summary of this passage, says this.

446
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,900
 Until we reach unity in the faith

447
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
 and in the knowledge of the Son of God

448
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,300
 and become mature, attaining to the whole measure

449
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
 of the fullness of Christ,

450
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,580
 then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth

451
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
 by the waves and blown here and there

452
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,440
 by every wind of teaching and by the cunning

453
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,840
 and craftiness of people in their deceitful schemings.

454
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,340
 Once we are mature in the fullness of Christ,

455
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,700
 we will no longer be taken captive

456
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,900
 by the schemings of this world.

457
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,440
 Some of you, you're here, you've been taken captive.

458
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,420
 You're sitting there as a slave.

459
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,740
 You've been taken captive by Dallas or Fort Worth

460
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,580
 or whatever is going on in your world.

461
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,180
 This scripture calls us to be overflowing

462
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,140
 with thankfulness.

463
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,100
 Listen, you can't leave here and try to be thankful.

464
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,660
 That will not work.

465
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,740
 But you reflect on the fact that God saved you

466
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,660
 in spite of you and he promises you eternal life himself,

467
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,740
 that he literally died for all the terrible things

468
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
 that you've done, that he said,

469
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,140
 "Hey, you don't have to pay for them.

470
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,660
 "I paid for them."

471
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,420
 And so now there's no condemnation

472
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,780
 for those who are in Jesus

473
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,060
 and you will not help but be thankful.

474
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,740
 When you reflect and renew your mind around the gospel

475
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,820
 that God saved you through Christ,

476
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,020
 his death and resurrection as a payment for your sins,

477
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,140
 you will be thankful.

478
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,080
 But we're not thankful because at some point, I think,

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,520
 we've began to think that Jesus

480
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,800
 and the paradise he offers is not enough.

481
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,240
 And you came in here and it's just like old news,

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
 like, "Oh yeah, yeah, Jesus, and I get to be with God

483
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,720
 "forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever,

484
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,000
 "and that's all good, but I want that

485
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,080
 "and a husband who's a doctor."

486
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,120
 And it's just like Jesus is not enough.

487
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,680
 Or you came in here and you don't see yourself as a sinner.

488
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,280
 And when I say sinner, I don't mean murderer

489
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,480
 or something that you've put in a special category.

490
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,900
 I mean you.

491
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,880
 I mean the things you did today.

492
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,740
 I mean the thoughts you've had in the past 30 seconds.

493
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,740
 How you lust, how you get angry, how you covet,

494
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,640
 how you're envious and jealous.

495
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,120
 You need a savior.

496
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
 Grateful, God gave you one, Jesus.

497
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,640
 Verse nine, "For in Christ, all the fullness of the deity

498
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,440
 "lives in bodily form, and in Christ,

499
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
 "you have been brought to fullness.

500
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,680
 "He is the head over every power and authority."

501
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 My second point is that Jesus satisfies our searching.

502
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,000
 In this passage right here, you see this word fullness

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
 over and over and over.

504
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,520
 So Jesus satisfies our searching.

505
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,280
 Jesus makes us full.

506
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
 Why?

507
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,400
 Because Jesus is, starting with this idea in this passage,

508
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,240
 fully God.

509
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,800
 That's Colossians 2, verse nine.

510
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,040
 Do you remember that convo I had with you

511
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,240
 a couple weeks ago about a convo I had

512
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,720
 with someone who was near and dear to me

513
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
 who denied that Jesus was God.

514
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,000
 They said, "Hey, I'm great with Jesus being the son of God.

515
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
 "I just don't think he was God."

516
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,960
 I took them to this passage.

517
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,160
 Look at Colossians 2, nine.

518
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,080
 Now I could've went John one, in the beginning was the word,

519
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
 and the word was with God, and the word was God.

520
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,480
 I could've went anyone who's seen me has seen the Father,

521
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,400
 I and the Father are one.

522
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,120
 A lot of different places in the scriptures,

523
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,000
 but I went right here 'cause I think it's the clearest.

524
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,440
 Colossians 2, nine.

525
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,920
 That, "For in Christ, all the fullness of the deity

526
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,680
 "lives in bodily form."

527
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,400
 When I stumbled into this place,

528
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,280
 I began looking for God with a bias against Christianity.

529
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,460
 Does that make sense?

530
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,120
 When I came to a place where I knew there was a God,

531
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,300
 and I realized that I needed to change my life,

532
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,600
 I began looking for God.

533
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
 I was agnostic.

534
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,560
 I didn't know who he was, but I knew that there was a creator.

535
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,920
 And as I began to look for him, I thought,

536
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,960
 "What are the odds that he be the Christian God?"

537
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,560
 'Cause I was born in America,

538
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,640
 and if I was born in India, I'd be Hindu.

539
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,380
 If I was born in China, I'd be Buddhist.

540
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,220
 If I was born in Iran, I'd be Muslim.

541
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,280
 If I was born in Israel, I'd be Jewish.

542
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,540
 And not to even mention the cults of the world.

543
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,120
 And so what are the odds I'd be born into the right place,

544
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,320
 worshiping the right God?

545
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,200
 So I began to look for him in the Quran.

546
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,560
 I began to look for him through the teachings

547
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,460
 of Eastern philosophy.

548
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,120
 I began to look for him in the other places,

549
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,660
 and I kept tripping over Jesus.

550
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,200
 I kept tripping over this man

551
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,360
 who reset the calendar 2015 years ago.

552
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
 I kept tripping over this man

553
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,560
 whose book is the bestseller year after year after year,

554
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
 and in the history of the world,

555
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,320
 by a margin of about a billion copies.

556
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
 There's something significant

557
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,680
 with this single most undisputed, undeniable,

558
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,900
 single most polarizing, most notorious character

559
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,820
 in the history of history, Jesus Christ.

560
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,800
 I said, I gotta deal with Jesus.

561
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,480
 The only reason you know about Jesus

562
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
 is because he is God.

563
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,460
 Because he is God.

564
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,920
 That's the only reason you know about Christ.

565
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,240
 There was a lot of people,

566
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,520
 Jesus was born in the armpit of the Roman Empire, okay?

567
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,920
 You should not know him.

568
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 He was a carpenter.

569
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 He was a nobody, except he was God.

570
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,760
 He was born in a time when a lot of people raised up

571
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,560
 and said that, hey, I'm a Messiah.

572
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,480
 No, I'm a Messiah.

573
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,400
 No, I'm the Messiah.

574
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
 No, I'm the Messiah.

575
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,920
 And Jesus showed up and said, no, I am.

576
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,040
 Chumps, no, he didn't say that.

577
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,880
 He should have.

578
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,700
 He should have.

579
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,060
 He shows up, he says, I am,

580
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,080
 and he becomes the single most polarizing,

581
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,160
 most famous, most notorious, most infamous character

582
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,760
 in the history of history.

583
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,600
 Why?

584
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,420
 Because he was God.

585
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,880
 And why is this relevant?

586
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 Because this text says that Jesus has full access to God,

587
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,720
 and therefore you have full access to Christ,

588
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,840
 and therefore you have full access to God.

589
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,200
 I wrote it down like this.

590
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,440
 Jesus has all of God, and you have all of Jesus,

591
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,540
 and so in Jesus, you have all of God.

592
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,560
 Jesus has all of God, and you have all of Jesus,

593
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,500
 and so in Jesus, you have all of God.

594
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 In Christ, it says you have been brought to fullness.

595
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,120
 Some people are like, man, I'm cool with Jesus.

596
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,520
 You can't be cool with Jesus.

597
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,080
 If Jesus was here, you would be brought

598
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,320
 to one of two conclusions.

599
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,760
 He is crazy.

600
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
 He's walking around saying he's God,

601
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,060
 or he's God, I'll worship him.

602
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,560
 But you ain't cool with Jesus.

603
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,540
 No one would be cool with Jesus.

604
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,700
 You would be moved to worship,

605
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,400
 or you would call the sand asylum.

606
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,040
 But you wouldn't be cool with him.

607
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,160
 And so it says in him, you have been brought to fullness.

608
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,100
 What does this mean?

609
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,200
 Why does this matter?

610
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,340
 Anybody seen "Interstellar"?

611
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,600
 It's a great movie.

612
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
 My friend Garrett's favorite movie, shout out Fort Worth.

613
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,620
 And you don't have to see it for this to make sense,

614
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,760
 but it just talks about a black hole,

615
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,040
 and so maybe you remember in science class, black holes,

616
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,040
 like this huge vacuum that just sucks up mass

617
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,400
 and matter, it just swallows anything

618
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,020
 that tries to go into it.

619
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,660
 Well, the scriptures says essentially

620
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,880
 that you have a black hole in your heart,

621
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,560
 that he set eternity in your heart,

622
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,700
 and that it is like this vacuum searching for significance

623
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,520
 as you go through your life,

624
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
 as you travel through your city,

625
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,820
 you're looking for something to fill this black hole,

626
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,520
 but the problem is it just swallows it.

627
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,400
 It's just a vacuum.

628
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,320
 Nothing can fill it except for Christ.

629
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 And so you're moving and you're searching for money

630
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
 and a job and an education and a boyfriend

631
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,880
 and a girlfriend or whatever, a new car,

632
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,440
 hoping that something's gonna fill it, and it won't.

633
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,840
 You buy a brand new car, and the next day it's an old car.

634
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,600
 It's just like, man, I thought it was gonna complete me,

635
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,560
 Jerry Maguire style, and it didn't,

636
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,360
 and I'm left wanting.

637
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,840
 And so here's why this matters, because who are you?

638
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,640
 Like you came in here tonight, what is your identity in?

639
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,320
 Like you think about all the things that make you you,

640
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,380
 your style, right?

641
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,240
 All the things that make you you,

642
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,680
 what you drive, yellow Xterra, sorority girl.

643
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,560
 Only you, bro.

644
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,120
 Where you live, your friend group.

645
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,060
 What makes you you, what you make, your education?

646
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,120
 What makes you you, where it's from, your education's from,

647
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,360
 where you went to school, is that a big part of your life?

648
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,840
 Is there identity in that?

649
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,800
 Whoop.

650
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,220
 (congregation laughing)

651
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,720
 (congregation applauding)

652
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,440
 What you like, what you do for fun,

653
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,480
 is that what makes you you?

654
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,000
 All those things, that's what makes you you?

655
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
 Uh-uh.

656
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,480
 You're God's.

657
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,000
 You belong to him, that's what makes you you.

658
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,920
 It's not who you are, but whose you are.

659
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,480
 You're his son or his daughter, just like my dog, Zach,

660
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,640
 walking around looking for another master.

661
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
 He needed to look no further past his collar.

662
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
 It said not only his name, but his owner's name.

663
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,200
 That's whose he was, that's who he belonged to.

664
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,440
 That's the farm that he lived on.

665
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,320
 Even when he wandered off of it, that's where he belonged.

666
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,520
 And likewise, you belong to God.

667
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,160
 You can wander in and out of bars, you can run up bar tabs,

668
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,920
 you can keep pursuing your sin

669
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,240
 or trying to find self-righteousness

670
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,880
 or the search for significance in a significant other,

671
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,260
 but he's who you belong to.

672
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,060
 You're his.

673
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,940
 You're God's.

674
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,340
 And so who you are, your identity is you're forgiven.

675
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,220
 You're free.

676
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,980
 You're redeemed, you're new, you're blameless,

677
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,620
 you're righteous, you're faultless,

678
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,540
 you're clean, you're complete, you're his child,

679
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,660
 the creator of the heavens and the earth says you're mine.

680
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,740
 Let me tell you why this is relevant,

681
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,140
 because personally, I'm just gonna tell you

682
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,420
 about two people, I told you about two dogs,

683
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,100
 now let's talk about two people.

684
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,060
 Person one, they have everything, okay?

685
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,540
 They've got the nicest car.

686
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,780
 They live in the neighborhood that everyone wants to live in.

687
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,220
 They make a lot of money, it comes in faster

688
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,540
 than they can spend it, right?

689
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,380
 They have style, right?

690
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,380
 They have, they're pretty, they're cute, they're handsome.

691
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,120
 They've got it going on, they walk into the place

692
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,080
 and everybody looks at them and it just seems

693
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,020
 like they have life all figured out.

694
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,860
 They are who so many of you want to be.

695
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,020
 And then there's person number two,

696
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,640
 who doesn't have any of that,

697
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,780
 but he has the one thing that fully satisfies,

698
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,420
 he walks in an abiding relationship with Christ

699
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,500
 and he's good.

700
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,300
 And I'm telling you, person number two

701
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,660
 is infinitely better off than person number one.

702
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,060
 There are a ton of depressed billionaires in the world,

703
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,360
 people who have what you think that you want,

704
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,200
 but they're not satisfied.

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,420
 But have you ever seen someone who just walks blameless

706
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,280
 before the Lord, he says, hey, that is my God

707
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,420
 and I am his son, I am his daughter, and they're just fine.

708
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,180
 People ridicule them, people mock them,

709
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,920
 they don't get the promotion and they're just fine.

710
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,780
 Have you ever met this person?

711
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,120
 They are infinitely wealthy.

712
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,540
 They have glorious riches, the scripture says.

713
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,280
 I know people like this.

714
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,500
 I was with my buddy yesterday, day before yesterday,

715
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,940
 bought a car, he bought a $2,300 car

716
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,120
 to replace his 1995 automobile

717
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,600
 with hundreds of thousands of miles

718
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,100
 because it was unsafe for his family to ride in.

719
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,140
 So he saved up $2,300 and he went and he paid cash

720
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,080
 for a car and he was so excited on the way home.

721
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,540
 He's just complete and Christ is just happy

722
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,340
 and he calls me today and he goes, how's the car?

723
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,180
 He's like, I love it.

724
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,860
 He said the radio went out.

725
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,460
 He goes, but I'm so thankful 'cause I think God

726
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,300
 just wants me to pray as I'm driving.

727
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,460
 I'm like, he celebrated that his radio didn't work.

728
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,100
 Like some of us would be throwing the radio

729
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,780
 through the window, you know, like what, this lemon.

730
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,660
 (congregation laughing)

731
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,280
 If you see it, it's a beautiful thing.

732
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,240
 But some of us were held captive to the world right now,

733
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,520
 wanting the things of the world desperate for them

734
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,400
 and we'll never experience that fullness,

735
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,080
 we'll never experience that joy, that completeness,

736
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,760
 that contentment that Christ offers

737
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
 because while we have some version of him,

738
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,680
 we don't have his fullness.

739
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,920
 We haven't surrendered to him fully.

740
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,320
 My friend, Ephesians 4:13 says, he has become mature,

741
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,840
 attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

742
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,800
 Don't you want that?

743
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,720
 Verse 11, in him you were also circumcised

744
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,880
 with a circumcision not performed by human hands.

745
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,900
 Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off

746
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,980
 when you were circumcised by Christ.

747
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,240
 What?

748
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,160
 Just got weird.

749
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,800
 My third and final point is Jesus severs our sin nature.

750
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,960
 I'm nervous up here, I'm like circumcision.

751
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,460
 Jesus severs our sin nature.

752
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,160
 There's only two places in the world

753
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,140
 where it's normal to talk about circumcision, okay?

754
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,880
 One is the church and two is the nursery and the hospital

755
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,520
 when you just had a son and that's it.

756
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,680
 Like you can't just bring that up at your work lunch,

757
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,840
 you know, hey guys, what do you guys think

758
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,340
 about circumcision, you know?

759
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,220
 [congregation laughing]

760
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,980
 And here's why, and it's about to get graphic

761
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,300
 and I'm doing this strategically,

762
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
 not to just try to distract you,

763
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
 but I mean, we're talking about removing

764
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,560
 the foreskin from a penis, okay?

765
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,820
 It's silly, I know, it's okay.

766
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,520
 But listen, listen, here's why I say it like that.

767
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,220
 Because that's what he's talking about.

768
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,860
 Like it's crazy.

769
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,180
 Like all of a sudden he's writing,

770
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,920
 he's like, yeah, the fullness of Christ

771
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,620
 and you know, Christ has the fullness of God

772
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,760
 and circumcision.

773
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,680
 [congregation laughing]

774
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,000
 What?

775
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,720
 So why is it relevant?

776
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,820
 There's an incredible theological profound reality in this.

777
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,480
 That as a shadow of the one who would come,

778
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,440
 who would remove our flesh, which is just another word

779
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,640
 for our sinful nature, our sinful desire,

780
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
 for thousands of years, God's people were set apart,

781
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,880
 specifically males, were set apart by the removal

782
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,960
 of that skin from that very sensitive area,

783
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,660
 which in males, frankly, is the organ that drives them

784
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,600
 to a lot of their sin nature, right?

785
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,040
 It's a metaphor, but it's a shadow of what was to come.

786
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,440
 It's incredible, think about it.

787
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,600
 I mean, it's still a common practice today.

788
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,840
 And it started with God, the creator of the heavens

789
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,600
 and the earth said, hey, I want you to do this.

790
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,660
 And then Jesus comes and Paul writes, he says,

791
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,400
 hey, Jesus, I'll read it to you again.

792
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,600
 In him, you also were circumcised with a circumcision

793
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,840
 not performed by human hands, not by doctor's hands,

794
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,840
 but your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off

795
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,320
 when you were circumcised by Christ.

796
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,320
 Okay, Jesus comes in your life and removes your sin nature.

797
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,420
 What does that mean?

798
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,160
 He removes your desire to sin.

799
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,120
 And you say, wait, no, he didn't.

800
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,720
 Oh, yes, he did.

801
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,720
 When you are yielding to your master, you are not sinning.

802
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,900
 When you are sinning, you've left the form.

803
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,760
 You said, hey, I no longer wanna be ruled by you

804
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
 and I'm gonna go look for another master.

805
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,700
 Today, it's Patron, tomorrow, it's this, that, the other,

806
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,520
 whatever that is for you.

807
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,320
 Pornography, cocaine, materialism, whatever,

808
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
 the list goes on and on.

809
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,200
 Shame, guilt, religiosity, self-righteousness,

810
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,280
 whatever that is for you, legalism.

811
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,960
 I've left the reservation, I'm now ruled by another master.

812
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,600
 But when I'm ruled by the one who gave me

813
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,700
 the circumcision of my heart, removing my flesh,

814
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,920
 I am not in sin, I'm finding life to its fullness.

815
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
 I have his fullness.

816
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,920
 This is so important for us to grasp.

817
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,320
 It's why I start so vulgar, because Paul does it.

818
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,600
 There's like, he's like, he's grabbing your attention

819
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,300
 with a huge word, a grotesque concept.

820
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,300
 To make a point, this is what Jesus does to your heart.

821
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,940
 When you were born again in Christ,

822
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,420
 there was a change in your heart that occurred.

823
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,540
 The things you enjoyed in sin become difficult,

824
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,960
 more difficult to enjoy.

825
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,940
 Let me say it a different way.

826
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,700
 That which was irresistible becomes resistible in Jesus.

827
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,340
 Where one day, you were like, I can't not do that.

828
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,300
 And now, it's like, I don't want to do that.

829
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,320
 While there's still something inside of me

830
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,700
 that wants to do that, as I yield to you, Christ,

831
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,020
 I don't want to do that.

832
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,900
 In fact, your spirit in me convicts me when I do do that.

833
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,320
 Not so that I feel shame, you've removed the shame,

834
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,020
 you nailed it to the cross, we'll talk about next week.

835
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,460
 But you've given me a spirit to follow.

836
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,280
 Before conversion, I could sin and delight in it.

837
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,860
 I would not have pause, I wouldn't care about the girl.

838
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,460
 If I pretended to care about her,

839
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,620
 that was just me running game.

840
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,100
 I mean, that was me trying to be sensitive.

841
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,300
 I didn't care about her.

842
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,580
 But then after conversion, I couldn't continue

843
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,280
 to do those things without caring.

844
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,640
 Do you see what the spirit of God did there?

845
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,700
 I began to feel convicted.

846
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,200
 My heart was circumcised.

847
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,980
 Jesus curbs your appetite so that you could come

848
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,220
 to a place where you say, God, what would you have me do?

849
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,740
 I no longer want to do what I want to do,

850
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,380
 what my appetite says I should do,

851
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,480
 what my lustful flesh says I should do.

852
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,820
 God, what would you have me do?

853
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,680
 Philippians 3, verse 19 talks about non-Christians

854
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,240
 in this way.

855
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,860
 Their destiny is destruction.

856
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,560
 Their God is their stomach, and their glory

857
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,280
 is in their shame.

858
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,840
 Their mind is set on earthly things.

859
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,300
 What does it mean that their God is their stomach?

860
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,720
 They follow the urges of their flesh.

861
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,380
 They follow their appetite.

862
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,740
 They follow their cravings.

863
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,280
 They follow their cravings.

864
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,480
 We follow Christ.

865
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,840
 Non-Christians follow cravings.

866
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,420
 Christians follow Christ.

867
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,960
 The regenerate Christian, the born again Christian

868
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
 is given new cravings.

869
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,160
 And so you say, you hear and you say,

870
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,100
 well, man, what if this isn't true, JP?

871
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,000
 What if I still crave all the old things?

872
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,480
 One of two things is true about you.

873
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,720
 So let me just break it down in a real way.

874
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,660
 One, possibly, one of two possibilities.

875
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,640
 One of two possible outcomes.

876
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,680
 One, you have not trusted in Christ.

877
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,320
 Trusted in Christ, his death and resurrection

878
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
 for the forgiveness of your sins.

879
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,560
 Because when you do that, his spirit is deposited in you

880
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,160
 as a seal, a promise of eternal life with God.

881
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
 And so if you can sin right now and not feel convicted

882
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,320
 and continue like a dog to his vomit to return

883
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,640
 to that thing and it not be a thing,

884
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,200
 then you may not have trusted in Christ.

885
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,640
 Or, second possible outcome, maybe you have.

886
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,760
 Maybe you're here, maybe you're a Christian,

887
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,880
 maybe we're gonna be together in heaven,

888
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,580
 but you're not abiding with Jesus.

889
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,120
 You're not walking with him, you're not rooted in him,

890
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,040
 you're not building up on the foundation of the gospel,

891
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
 the thing that you trusted in.

892
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,640
 You just, somehow you got saved,

893
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,860
 you got your ticket into heaven,

894
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,320
 and then you've run off the farm.

895
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,720
 You have the collar around your neck,

896
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,000
 it says whose you are, you just don't believe it.

897
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,900
 And you're looking for another master.

898
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,840
 I get an email like this nearly every week.

899
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,580
 So this is representative of hundreds of emails.

900
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,140
 So if you feel nervous that I'm reading your email,

901
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,300
 no need to, it's hundreds of emails, truly.

902
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,980
 It starts out like this, it was one line.

903
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,300
 I need some advice on how to end a porn addiction.

904
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,260
 That's all it said.

905
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,580
 I wrote back.

906
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,980
 I was there, bro.

907
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,340
 I assume you mean it when you say you want advice.

908
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,620
 I assume you are ready to do whatever it takes, make war.

909
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,820
 First, regeneration every Monday night

910
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,100
 until you complete the program.

911
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,200
 If you are in Dallas, if you are not in Dallas,

912
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,840
 join a faith-based recovery program.

913
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,180
 Number two, join membership in the church, ASAP.

914
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,280
 Number three, meet with a community group weekly

915
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,500
 for confession and prayer.

916
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,980
 Number four, stop being alone with your girlfriend,

917
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,800
 get rid of your computer or smartphone.

918
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,040
 Number five, this is a question for you to answer.

919
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,300
 How can you learn your Bible?

920
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,380
 And this is the important part

921
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,600
 if your kind of works radar is going off right now.

922
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,860
 All of this instruction is simply to help you pursue Jesus

923
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,500
 with your whole life.

924
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,780
 And you will find life like you never have,

925
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,660
 Matthew 10, verse 39 I wrote.

926
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,940
 Whoever loses his life will find it.

927
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,420
 Whoever finds his life,

928
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,640
 whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

929
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,960
 You can do this.

930
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,940
 Here are some additional resources that might help.

931
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,820
 It's a blog, it's our porch blog.

932
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,860
 We wrote on pornography, a video,

933
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,460
 a marriage porn apart on YouTube from our conference here.

934
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,560
 And essentially, and that's a JP.

935
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
 Essentially, these are just resources to be rooted,

936
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,820
 built up and strengthened.

937
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,220
 He or she wrote back, thanks.

938
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,300
 I do all of that, but I just can't seem to stop.

939
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,260
 Is there any new approach to holding on better to Christ?

940
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,980
 To which I wrote back, I'll read it to you.

941
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:46,020
 Anybody here want a new approach to pursuing Christ?

942
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,860
 Let me read this to you.

943
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,480
 New approach to holding on better to Christ?

944
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,320
 That's like asking,

945
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,780
 is there a new approach to holding onto a cliff

946
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,840
 suspended hundreds of feet above the ground,

947
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,500
 fighting gravity with your fingertips

948
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,980
 as death beckons for you from below?

949
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,020
 You hold on for dear life because you must in order to live.

950
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,460
 You shed weight, Hebrews 12, one and two.

951
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,820
 You throw off anything that is helping gravity

952
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,420
 in its effort to kill you.

953
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,220
 Is there a new approach to holding on better to Christ?

954
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,460
 Let me make sure I understand.

955
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,980
 You have completed region.

956
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,700
 If so, let's meet together with your sponsor this Tuesday,

957
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,380
 if not, be there Monday.

958
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,440
 I don't show that you are a member,

959
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,960
 but that might be an error on my end.

960
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,400
 Forgive me if that's the case.

961
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,460
 Can you confirm that you're a member?

962
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,220
 Who are others in your community group?

963
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,720
 Can you add them to this email?

964
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,500
 I'd like them to be there when we meet

965
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,740
 and better understand their counsel to you.

966
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,220
 Congrats on getting rid of your smartphone or PC.

967
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,740
 This is so hard for people in your situation.

968
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,260
 It definitely separates those who are playing games

969
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,140
 from those who are serious about getting well.

970
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
 Lastly, I didn't see your response.

971
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,340
 How can you learn your Bible better?

972
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,220
 New approach to holding onto Christ?

973
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,460
 Help me understand your old approach.

974
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,440
 I assure you, the Jesus who interrupted God's fury

975
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,400
 at your sin has not let you down.

976
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,840
 Does he have your all?

977
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,300
 He gave his.

978
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,120
 Please respond in detail to the questions above.

979
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,100
 Praying for you now, JP.

980
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,940
 And so if you want a new approach to pursuing Christ,

981
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,280
 would you try his approach?

982
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,400
 Coming to him with your need?

983
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,000
 Saying, God, I've been playing games.

984
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,360
 I've said I know you.

985
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,900
 I wanna be king of Dallas or Fort Worth or Plano

986
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,140
 or wherever I'm at.

987
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,780
 I wanna be queen of my work and my area,

988
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,700
 my apartment, my neighborhood.

989
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
 I want everyone to love me.

990
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,420
 I wanna be God, not worship you as God.

991
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,080
 Lord, I need a savior.

992
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,840
 And I know you sent Jesus to die for my sins.

993
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,300
 You put him on the cross because I had that abortion,

994
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,100
 because I got drunk one too many times,

995
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,740
 'cause I slept with my significant other multiple times,

996
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,900
 because I did that that night

997
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,600
 and I swore I'd never tell anyone.

998
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,500
 Because of the things that I've done.

999
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,860
 I put that stuff up my nose.

1000
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,700
 I put it in my veins.

1001
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,540
 I smoked that.

1002
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,260
 I drank that.

1003
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,080
 I did that.

1004
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,280
 And when I didn't, I thought I was good enough

1005
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,940
 that I didn't need to walk with you.

1006
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,880
 I didn't need to turn to you.

1007
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,320
 New approach to holding on to Christ?

1008
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,840
 You, like Max, do everything you can

1009
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,180
 to get back to the farm.

1010
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,480
 You swim the river, you walk miles,

1011
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,800
 you do whatever you need to do to cling tightly to Jesus,

1012
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,920
 who gave everything for you.

1013
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,840
 Not to be saved, but because you are.

1014
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,260
 And if you're not, then start there.

1015
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,200
 I'm a sinner and I need a savior.

1016
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,500
 I need you, Jesus.

1017
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,920
 There's no new way to experience God.

1018
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,180
 It's being rooted in Jesus.

1019
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,160
 You return to the basics that you were taught at first,

1020
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,120
 the gospel, that he died for your sins

1021
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,960
 and raised from the dead.

1022
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,200
 You build on that foundation.

1023
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,820
 Jesus knows the will of God.

1024
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,240
 Man's wisdom will never, ever surpass his.

1025
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,680
 There's no one on the planet who knows better than Christ.

1026
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
 There's no one smarter than the Bible.

1027
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,720
 And you reflect on the gospel and give an outpouring

1028
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,600
 of thanks that he gave his life for you.

1029
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,480
 And so in summary, Jesus strengthens your stance.

1030
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,520
 Jesus satisfies your searching.

1031
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,400
 And Jesus severs your sin nature.

1032
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,380
 A full life will not be found apart from Jesus.

1033
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,760
 And some of you, like Zach, you've left the farm,

1034
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,680
 you're searching, you're opening doors,

1035
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,280
 you're looking behind them.

1036
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,500
 You're going places you know you shouldn't,

1037
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,360
 but you're in search of a better master

1038
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,240
 than the one who came to be master of you.

1039
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,840
 And you think there's something else out there

1040
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,800
 that's gonna fill you, some other wisdom,

1041
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,840
 some superior knowledge than God's wisdom.

1042
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,040
 Do the things you did at first.

1043
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,400
 Grow in him the same way you came to him.

1044
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,720
 Through the gospel, start there.

1045
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,320
 He is a good master, scratch that.

1046
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,320
 He is the only best, superior, absolute master.

1047
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,320
 In him there is freedom.

1048
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,600
 There's a story that's been told about Abraham Lincoln.

1049
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,560
 I read it a few weeks ago and I thought

1050
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,920
 I'd share it with you here.

1051
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,200
 I'll just read it to you.

1052
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,960
 There's an old story that Abraham Lincoln

1053
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,720
 went down to the slave block to buy back a slave girl.

1054
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,800
 As she looked at the white man bidding on her,

1055
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
 she figured he was just another white man

1056
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,920
 going to buy her and then abuse her.

1057
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,840
 He won the bid and bid until he won.

1058
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,260
 And as he was walking away with his now new property

1059
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,320
 at that time, he said,

1060
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,640
 young lady, you are free.

1061
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,640
 She said, what does that mean?

1062
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,380
 Am I free to say whatever I want to say?

1063
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,200
 And Lincoln said, yes, my dear, you are free.

1064
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,040
 You can say whatever you wanna say.

1065
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,240
 And she says, does that mean that I can be

1066
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,640
 whatever I want to be?

1067
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,200
 He said, yes, my dear, you're free.

1068
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,900
 You can be whatever you wanna be.

1069
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,320
 And she says, does that mean I'm free

1070
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,480
 to go wherever I wanna go?

1071
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,640
 And he looked at her and he said, yes, dear.

1072
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,240
 I've purchased you and I've set you free.

1073
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,100
 You're free to go wherever you wanna go.

1074
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,280
 And she said with tears streaming down her face,

1075
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,480
 then I will go with you.

1076
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,000
 Whenever you see that kind of master,

1077
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,480
 you wanna follow it.

1078
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,520
 Don't you see this message is not try harder.

1079
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,880
 It's not go out there, grip the will.

1080
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,160
 Hey, you know, you get in that bar and you feel bad.

1081
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,040
 You should feel ashamed.

1082
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,060
 No, but you follow Jesus right out of that bar.

1083
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,560
 If that's your thing, if drinking is a problem for you,

1084
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,880
 you follow Jesus right out of that sin.

1085
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,920
 He's not leading you there.

1086
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,560
 Like the only way you got there

1087
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,680
 is because you weren't surrendered to him as your master.

1088
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,840
 Whatever that sin is,

1089
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,560
 the only way you got in that dude's apartment,

1090
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,720
 it wasn't because you were following Jesus.

1091
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,360
 It was because you were following some dude

1092
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,720
 with a messianic complex, claiming to be Jesus in your life.

1093
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:40,040
 He's going to be a God awful Jesus, a miserable Jesus.

1094
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,560
 But I know a great one who came to set you free,

1095
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,000
 that you would follow him, that he would give you life.

1096
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,400
 You will not experience life

1097
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,100
 as it was intended to experience apart from him.

1098
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,620
 You will be left empty.

1099
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,660
 I say that from experience.

1100
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,240
 I'm someone who has been left empty

1101
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,160
 and I found life in Christ.

1102
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,280
 I found life in him.

1103
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,040
 It's amazing.

1104
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,360
 I wanna invite you into it.

1105
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,680
 As we move to worship, I pray that you would reflect on this.

1106
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,000
 Let me pray now.

1107
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,900
 Father, we're pleading for you.

1108
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,160
 We want the fullness that is found in Christ alone.

1109
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,160
 We thank you that you came not to put a leash on us, God,

1110
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,720
 or to tie us to a tree,

1111
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,580
 or to put shackles of religion on us, God.

1112
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,560
 But you unshackled us.

1113
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,640
 You untied the leash.

1114
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,620
 You untied the rope and the chain.

1115
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,000
 And you said we're free.

1116
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,700
 Now follow you to life.

1117
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,880
 Thank you for Christ's example.

1118
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,720
 Thank you for all that you've done for us in him.

1119
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,880
 Thank you for the life that you've given us.

1120
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,880
 Thank you for freedom that can be found in him alone.

1121
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,240
 And so, Father, as we worship you,

1122
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,640
 would you help us to reflect on that freedom?

1123
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,680
 I pray we would worship with reckless abandonment,

1124
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,280
 that we would, that literally as we sing to you,

1125
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,160
 shackles would hit the floor,

1126
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,680
 that as we sing to you, the chains would hit the floor,

1127
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,800
 and that we would follow you to freedom.

1128
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:31,800
