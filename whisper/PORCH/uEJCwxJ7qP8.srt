1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,240
 - All right, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,040
 friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,720
 Northwest Arkansas, Tulsa, Houston,

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
 wherever you are tuning in

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,120
 and joining from all over.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,280
 We are continuing the series, God Save the Queen,

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,440
 as we explore the Old Testament book of the Bible

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,040
 on the life of Esther, named Esther, the queen,

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,340
 and the crazy story that is around her life.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,400
 Let me start by asking this,

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,280
 who is the greatest villain in any movie of all time?

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,680
 Joker?

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,060
 Darth Vader?

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
 Venom?

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,000
 In any great story, any great story has with it,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,900
 man, you guys are really extra on this whole villain thing.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,540
 In any great story has a, The Bachelor, well, wow.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,240
 In any great story has a villain involved in it,

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,600
 and tonight we're gonna be introduced,

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,560
 but here's some of the ones that I think

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,160
 are the most iconic villains of all time.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,200
 You got the Joker, of course,

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,560
 then you got Bane, Darth Vader,

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,260
 maybe the most classic, then Thanos,

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,660
 then Scar, of course, and then Dr. Evil.

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,360
 Of course, I've never seen, 'cause I'm a Christian, and.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,320
 But every great story has a villain involved in it,

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,560
 it has a hero, it has a villain,

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
 it has a great storyline and great plot,

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,400
 and the story of Esther is no different,

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,920
 and tonight we're gonna be introduced

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,160
 to the villain in this story,

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,960
 but unlike those other stories, this is a true story.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
 Let me catch you up in case you missed last week,

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,080
 and it'll give us a little direction

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
 for where the evening will be.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
 The book of Esther is a story of a young girl

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,360
 who goes from a peasant to a princess, if you will.

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,880
 It's a rags to riches story.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,920
 Last week, we looked at the first two chapters,

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,640
 where Esther, we're told, was this orphan girl

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
 that was adopted by her uncle,

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
 and she ended up marrying King Xerxes,

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,080
 and King Xerxes was the ruler of the empire,

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,160
 the Persian Empire,

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,180
 greatest empire the world had ever seen,

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,440
 so we had these three characters,

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,000
 Xerxes, Mordecai, and Esther,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,360
 so for Xerxes, think Jake Gyllenhaal, we said.

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,800
 There he is, still looking good.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,240
 Then you have Esther, I'm mixing it up this week,

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
 'cause nobody knew who Bella Hadid was,

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
 and going with still Bella Hadid,

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,740
 Gal Gadot, is that how you say that?

56
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,560
 Wonder Woman, however you say her name, Wonder Woman,

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,120
 and then, of course, Uncle Mordecai,

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
 the most famous uncle of all time would be?

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,320
 Uncle Jesse, keeping it real,

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,720
 and tonight, we're gonna be introduced

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,000
 to our villain, whose name is Haman,

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,200
 and for that, I have selected Jafar.

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,800
 One, because look at that guy,

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
 number two, because it really fits,

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
 like Jafar was this prime minister, if you will,

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,960
 who kinda had the emperor or the sultan under his thumb.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
 Haman is no different,

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
 and you'll understand what I mean by that,

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,800
 but here's what's going on,

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
 so this all took place in the Persian Empire,

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,900
 it's a true story, it's a real story,

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,580
 and the Persian Empire was ruled by King Xerxes.

73
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,240
 He was a pagan, he didn't know God,

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,220
 didn't worship God, he thought he was God, not a great guy.

75
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,760
 He holds a beauty pageant and says,

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
 "I'm gonna look for the most beautiful woman

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,580
 "in 127 states, anywhere from Egypt all the way to India,

78
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,180
 "I wanna find the most beautiful woman,"

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,400
 and Esther, this incredibly beautiful woman,

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
 wins the beauty pageant and becomes

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 the queen of the entire empire,

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
 and this kinda takes place,

83
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,600
 and she all of a sudden finds herself

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,320
 in the midst of the empire

85
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,780
 and set up for whatever God's gonna do,

86
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,800
 and the whole story showcases

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,680
 that even when you can't exactly see what God is doing,

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
 you can rest assured he is at work.

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,760
 So today, even though we're introduced to the villain here,

90
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
 it only is a part of God's plan

91
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,080
 and what God's gonna bring about

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,600
 despite the evil that is introduced in this story,

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,660
 just like God's at work despite any evil

94
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,260
 that's introduced in any story.

95
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,200
 So with that said, we're gonna be in Esther chapter three.

96
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,000
 If last week was the Bachelor Persia edition,

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
 this would be the making of a murderer,

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,480
 if you will, if you saw that Netflix show,

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,060
 and we're gonna just see kinda how Haman became this guy

100
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,420
 who at one point wants to inflict genocide

101
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,200
 on all of the Jewish people.

102
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,320
 Again, this is about 480 years before Jesus

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,000
 in what is modern day Iran.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
 Story continues.

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,880
 Esther chapter three, verse one.

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
 Now, sometime later, King Xerxes promoted Haman,

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,600
 the son of Hemathada, the Agagite,

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,760
 over all the other nobles,

109
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,580
 making him the most powerful official in the empire.

110
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,000
 All the king's officials would bow down

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,240
 or lay prostrate to Haman to show him respect

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,760
 whenever he passed by, for the king had commanded.

113
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,760
 But Mordecai, who's Uncle Jesse, who's Esther's uncle,

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,680
 who works at the king's gate,

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,760
 refused to bow down or to show him respect.

116
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,440
 The reason why, we're told in a few verses later,

117
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,600
 is that he says, "I won't, out of my faith,

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,940
 "bow down and worship any human person.

119
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,880
 "So I don't care who you are, I'm not gonna do it."

120
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,680
 So every time that Haman would show up at work

121
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
 and he'd go to the front of the palace,

122
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,140
 think about he's like entering the palace gates.

123
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,000
 There's all the prison guards,

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,120
 or there's all the guards, if you will, all the staff.

125
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
 Everybody lays down and bows down

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,520
 except for one guy every single time, that's Mordecai.

127
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,240
 Now, when Haman, verse five,

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,000
 saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect,

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,220
 he was filled with rage, and he learned that Mordecai,

130
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,000
 he learned of his nationality, that he was Jewish.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,920
 So he decided it was not enough

132
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,480
 to lay hands on Mordecai alone.

133
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,980
 Instead, he would look for a way to destroy all the Jews

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,300
 throughout the entire empire of Xerxes.

135
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,760
 So he goes from, "I'm not just gonna take this guy out.

136
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,700
 "The fact that his Jewish faith won't let him bow down,

137
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,280
 "I'm gonna take all of them out."

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,160
 Long before Hitler was ever around,

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,520
 this is the first person,

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
 or at least one of the first people

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,460
 that wanted to completely annihilate

142
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,060
 the Jewish race and Jewish people.

143
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,360
 Throughout history, there's been a lot of times

144
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,900
 people have done this, quickly side note.

145
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,780
 And part of the reason is because there's a satanic

146
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,460
 or an evil force out there.

147
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,820
 So people over and over have tried

148
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,300
 to annihilate the Jewish people

149
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,420
 because God promised that through the Jewish people

150
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,940
 would come a Messiah to save the world.

151
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,220
 So if you could take out the Jewish people,

152
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,800
 you would take out the Jewish Messiah that was to come.

153
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,180
 So that was what was driving or behind Haman's actions.

154
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,540
 That he wants a full genocide on these guys.

155
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,500
 So he comes in the month of April

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,780
 during the 12th year of King Xerxes reign.

157
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,960
 Lots were cast in Haman's presence.

158
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,360
 And the lots were called perem.

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
 We're gonna come back to that in a second.

160
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,840
 To determine the best day and month to take action.

161
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,920
 And the day selected was March 7th, nearly a year later.

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
 So kind of random side note, but basically he's like,

163
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,080
 "Dude, we're gonna take all these guys out.

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,040
 "I'm prime minister.

165
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,400
 "I'm gonna put together a plan."

166
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,260
 But he did something that was common then.

167
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,460
 It's not really common now where he's like,

168
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,360
 "How do I decide which day on the calendar?

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,580
 "Let's roll the dice."

170
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,800
 And so they rolled the dice and the dice came out

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,340
 with a day, the dice being called perem,

172
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,780
 and a day that was almost a year later in March.

173
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,860
 And we're told that he marks the calendar.

174
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,100
 This is gonna be the day.

175
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,260
 Now he gets his plan, goes to the king.

176
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,140
 Says, "I got the day picked.

177
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,580
 "Now I gotta go convince the king

178
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,740
 "to let me kill this people."

179
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,900
 Here's what happens.

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,580
 Then Haman approached King Xerxes.

181
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,860
 He said, "There is a race of people

182
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,800
 "scattered all throughout the provinces of your empire,

183
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,100
 "all throughout the states,

184
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,140
 "and they keep themselves separate from everyone else.

185
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,420
 "Their laws are different from those of many other people.

186
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,240
 "They refuse to obey the laws of the king,

187
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,580
 "as in to worship me.

188
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,860
 "So it's not in the king's interest to let them live.

189
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,580
 "If it pleases the king,"

190
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,640
 again, this is why I say he's Jafar,

191
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,820
 "let him issue a decree that they be destroyed,

192
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,620
 "and I will give you 10,000 large sacks of silver

193
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,320
 "to the government administrators

194
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,500
 "to be deposited in the royal treasury."

195
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 That 10,000 large sacks of silver

196
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,880
 would be today equivalent to $280 billion.

197
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,620
 The entire GDP of the empire at that time was 15,000.

198
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
 I mean, it's a huge empire.

199
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
 And he says, "Look, hey, we're gonna basically almost double.

200
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,920
 "That's what I'm gonna guarantee to you."

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,020
 So the king, who, if you know anything about history,

202
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,620
 at this point in time, Xerxes, movie 300,

203
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,100
 he just lost Thermopylae.

204
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,380
 He just lost those 300 dudes

205
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,820
 who'd been doing a lot of crossfit.

206
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,660
 He lost those guys, and he's like,

207
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,540
 "Man, I need some more cash and some people."

208
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,180
 And so, of course, he's like, "Yeah, let's do it.

209
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,320
 "If you can give me that much money,

210
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,400
 "I don't care who they are,

211
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
 "and it sounds like you got a good plan."

212
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,980
 So the king sent dispatches all over the country

213
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,020
 who were sent by swift messengers

214
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,500
 into all of the provinces of the empire,

215
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,660
 giving the order that all Jews, both young and old,

216
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,940
 including women and children, must be killed,

217
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,020
 slaughtered, and annihilated on a single day.

218
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,140
 This was scheduled to happen

219
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,980
 on March 7th of the next year.

220
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,800
 The property of the Jews would be given

221
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
 to whoever kills them.

222
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,980
 It's crazy.

223
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,140
 It's terrible.

224
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,260
 No matter their age, I want you to spread

225
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,540
 in everywhere, in every state,

226
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,660
 in all the different languages the empire represented.

227
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
 They would have people and messengers that went in,

228
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,540
 and whatever language you spoke,

229
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,140
 they nailed on the telephone poles of that day.

230
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,060
 Here's the edict, and here's what's gonna happen.

231
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,080
 On this day in March, every person who is Jewish

232
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,900
 is to be killed, and you can take any of their stuff.

233
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,060
 It's like a twisted, old-school version

234
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,460
 of the Purge or something.

235
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,660
 So all the Jews throughout the land

236
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,960
 are, of course, terrified.

237
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,780
 When Mordecai learned, because Mordecai's Jewish

238
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,500
 just like Esther is, when he learned

239
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,780
 about all that had been done, he tore his clothes.

240
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,540
 He put on burlap and ashes, and he went out into the city

241
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,300
 crying with a loud and bitter wail.

242
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,420
 So Mordecai's going around.

243
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,240
 He's crying.

244
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
 He's weeping.

245
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,460
 We're told the Jewish people are going around crying

246
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,740
 and weeping, that they know, like, man, this is,

247
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,540
 basically, I need to arrange a funeral

248
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,180
 for me and my whole family, and the whole empire,

249
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,340
 and especially the city of Susa,

250
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,580
 we're told, is thrown into confusion.

251
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,580
 When Esther, Queen Esther's maids and eunuchs

252
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,180
 came and told her, your Uncle Mordecai is weeping,

253
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,380
 and he's wearing burlap, which is not a good look

254
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,780
 for anybody, and crying all throughout the city,

255
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,640
 and she doesn't know what's going on at this point.

256
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
 Remember, she had hidden her Jewish identity.

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,580
 The king didn't know she was Jewish.

258
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
 Very few people did, but she hears, like,

259
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,800
 hey, your uncle is just, like, wailing and weeping

260
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,340
 all around the city, and so she decides.

261
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,120
 She was deeply distressed, so she sent clothing to him

262
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,840
 to replace the burlap.

263
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
 I love that.

264
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
 This is a classic lady move.

265
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,880
 Girl's voice sad.

266
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
 I know it cheers me up.

267
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
 I'm gonna send him some new, fresh outfit,

268
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,600
 some new clothes, some retail therapy.

269
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,260
 Here's a gift card of Neiman's, whatever you have back then,

270
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,900
 and we're told Mordecai refuses it.

271
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,380
 So then he sends word of the queen,

272
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,660
 and basically he's like, hey, don't you know

273
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,500
 what's happened?

274
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,240
 And he sends a copy, we're told, of the edict.

275
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,700
 Like, takes one off the telephone pole.

276
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,220
 Hey, send this, and gets a servant,

277
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,500
 and he sends it over to Queen Esther,

278
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
 and she sees what's happening, and he says,

279
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,420
 go in and plead for the life of your people.

280
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,980
 Go to the king and plead for the life of your people.

281
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,020
 And she says, you don't know what you're asking me to do.

282
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,900
 You realize that would be a death wish.

283
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,220
 At that point in time, you could not just approach the king,

284
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,260
 even if he's your husband.

285
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,000
 You could not go in unless you invited to see the king.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,660
 Anyone who did so, who didn't get the royal scepter

287
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,780
 extended, would lose their life.

288
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,200
 It says this.

289
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,260
 Then Esther told Hathak, who's the servant,

290
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,720
 kinda going back and forth between them,

291
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,260
 go back and relay this message to Mordecai.

292
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,900
 All the king's officials, and even the people

293
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,500
 in the provinces know anyone who appears before the king

294
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,660
 in his inner court without being invited is doomed to die,

295
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,940
 unless the king holds out the golden scepter.

296
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,740
 I can't just go in there and plead, Mordecai.

297
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,040
 It'd be a death sentence.

298
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,740
 And the king has not called for me in 30 days.

299
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,780
 As in, we know this king had hundreds of women in a harem.

300
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,620
 He's not sleeping alone at night, and he's gone 30 days

301
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,380
 since he called his wife in the last time.

302
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,740
 She's basically going, I'm not sure this is a great time

303
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
 for me to approach him, if you will.

304
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,560
 We're not exactly jiving right now.

305
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,100
 So she sends that message back to Mordecai,

306
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
 and Mordecai responds with this message.

307
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,700
 Mordecai sent this reply to Esther.

308
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,740
 "Don't think for a moment that because you're in the palace,

309
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,140
 "you will escape when all the other Jews are killed.

310
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,980
 "If you keep quiet, at a time like this,

311
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,300
 "deliverance and relief will come from the Jews,

312
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,300
 "come for the Jews, and it will arise from some other place,

313
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,280
 "but you and your relatives will die," Mordecai says.

314
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,940
 If you keep quiet, you're either gonna die

315
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,760
 because the king doesn't extend the scepter,

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
 or you're gonna die because of this edict,

317
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,500
 but God's gonna save his people,

318
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,220
 even if it doesn't involve you.

319
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,100
 Who knows, one of the most iconic verses in the book,

320
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,100
 verse 14, "Who knows if perhaps you were made queen

321
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,520
 "for such a time as this?"

322
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,160
 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai,

323
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,260
 "Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa

324
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,920
 "and fast for me.

325
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,580
 "Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.

326
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,900
 "My maids and I will do the same.

327
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,400
 "And then though it is against the law,

328
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,480
 "I will go in to see the king,

329
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,440
 "and if I must die, I must die."

330
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,400
 So Mordecai went away, and he did everything

331
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,540
 that Esther had ordered him.

332
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,500
 We're gonna hit pause and continue the story

333
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,460
 of exactly what happens next next week.

334
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,860
 But I really wanna camp out on these last few verses

335
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,700
 because we see an exchange and an interaction

336
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,100
 that is related to Mordecai seeing and saying,

337
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,400
 "You've gotta connect the dots, Esther.

338
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,780
 "All the things that seem so random,

339
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,840
 "and how'd you go from the present to the princess,

340
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,980
 "or a peasant to the princess in just a moment or a day,

341
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,080
 "in such a short time period,

342
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,360
 "it was clearly God was always at work.

343
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,880
 "Can't you see?

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
 "Could it be that you've been put where you are

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
 "for such a time as this?

346
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,000
 "Don't miss out on fulfilling the purpose

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,660
 "for which you're in that palace."

348
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,400
 And I wanna look and observe really three things

349
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,040
 as it relates to this idea of purpose

350
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,520
 that we learn from Esther's story and this interaction

351
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,600
 and really her life and her actions here.

352
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,660
 Because all of us came to the room,

353
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,220
 and one thing, that somewhere in your heart of hearts,

354
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,280
 whether or not you'd even admit it,

355
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,840
 there's part of you that deeply desires

356
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
 to live a life that's full of purpose.

357
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,580
 In other words, no matter how successful any of us become,

358
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,220
 no matter how well we do in our jobs,

359
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,600
 no matter how well we do in our careers,

360
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
 no matter what type of car you drove,

361
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,520
 or what type of house you have someday,

362
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,480
 or how many kids you have,

363
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,360
 no matter whatever you define as success,

364
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,200
 if it doesn't involve a life of significance,

365
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,760
 like, "Dude, my life mattered,"

366
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,520
 we're a waste.

367
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,560
 And the good news is God is deeply concerned

368
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
 about you experiencing your purpose

369
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,760
 and the reason that he has you on this planet.

370
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,000
 And so there's three things that we learn

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,360
 from the interaction that they have here

372
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,280
 as it relates to you realizing your purpose.

373
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,120
 'Cause some of the stuff that was true for her is very true,

374
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,800
 or these three truths are not just true for her,

375
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
 they're true for you and true for me.

376
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,920
 The first one, as it relates to purpose,

377
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,240
 if you're taking notes,

378
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,500
 is this idea that you and your life

379
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,120
 has been shaped on purpose.

380
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,480
 Like, he's looking at the queen and he's going,

381
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,580
 "Hey, could it be, Esther?

382
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,560
 "I mean, think about it.

383
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,880
 "You're the queen in the palace.

384
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,060
 "God has shaped your life.

385
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,440
 "This is your moment.

386
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
 "You're not there for some random reason

387
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,960
 "or to build your palace or just to have access

388
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,220
 "to whatever the king's clothes

389
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,480
 "and whatever lifestyle is there.

390
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,520
 "You're there on purpose, don't miss it.

391
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,620
 "Your life has been shaped on purpose."

392
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,040
 How was Esther's life shaped?

393
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
 Like, God shaped, he was involved in the details

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,200
 and who she was and forming her story

395
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
 and the way that she looked.

396
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,400
 He was over all of that.

397
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,200
 We're told that she was a woman of incredible beauty.

398
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 That wasn't something that she chose or got to decide.

399
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,920
 It was because God was involved in shaping her story.

400
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,840
 And one of the ways that he shaped her

401
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
 was that he gave her incredible beauty.

402
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
 We're told in Esther chapter two, verse seven,

403
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,040
 it says the same thing two different times.

404
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,320
 Or it highlights, it goes out of the way

405
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
 in a way that I don't know of another place in scripture

406
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,720
 where it says both of the things it says.

407
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,040
 This young woman, Esther, had a lovely

408
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,120
 or really good figure and was beautiful,

409
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,220
 or your translation may say beautiful to look at.

410
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,280
 The author goes out of the way and be like,

411
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,080
 "Dude, this girl had a good body

412
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
 "and she had a really pretty face.

413
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,120
 "She was thick with two Cs

414
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,840
 "and that's the type of girl this was."

415
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,280
 And God was over that.

416
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,580
 That God had formed and shaped and he really put together.

417
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,920
 You can't take responsibility for that.

418
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,680
 You're the most beautiful woman in 127 provinces.

419
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,600
 Think about that.

420
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,640
 You can't take responsibility.

421
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,880
 You think that's just random?

422
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,000
 All of that was because God was shaping you

423
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,800
 on purpose for a purpose.

424
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,320
 In fact, even her story in the same verse,

425
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,760
 it says that Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter

426
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
 when her father and mother had died.

427
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,880
 A tragic moment where she buries both of her parents

428
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,280
 and she goes to live with her uncle

429
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,860
 in the city of Susa, the king.

430
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,200
 And God was over all that

431
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,880
 and he was shaping and bringing about.

432
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
 And all of a sudden he places the most beautiful woman,

433
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,240
 maybe the king or anyone at that point had ever seen.

434
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,260
 And he puts her in the city next to the king.

435
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,360
 God was over all of it.

436
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
 Can't you see, Esther,

437
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,040
 your life has been shaped on purpose.

438
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
 Your life.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,060
 Those listening right now and everybody in the room,

440
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,120
 your life has been shaped on purpose.

441
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
 I don't know that you're actually gonna believe

442
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,240
 when I say that, like your story, how you look,

443
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
 the gifts that you have, your personality,

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
 the talents, the way that you think.

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,080
 All of it maybe has been touched and impacted by sin

446
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,240
 as sin always does.

447
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,300
 But God was intimately involved in shaping

448
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,820
 and is shaping your story.

449
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,300
 You have been shaped on purpose for a purpose.

450
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,840
 My daughter, I have a one and a half year old daughter

451
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,320
 named Monroe.

452
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,160
 And I think there's a picture of her.

453
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,940
 There she is, just cardigan and all, three dolls deep.

454
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,120
 She's ready for church.

455
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,880
 And she loves this game that's like this shapes game.

456
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,120
 It looks like this game, this is just what you do

457
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,480
 whenever you have kids, one year olds and kids.

458
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
 You sit around, you do these shapes.

459
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
 What's the point of the game?

460
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,280
 Take that little star right there.

461
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
 And there's a little star hole.

462
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,360
 It's a pretty simple game.

463
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,000
 I can't believe I'm explaining this right now.

464
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,280
 But you take it and then you put it in this star hole.

465
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
 It's not as simple as you would think for a one year old.

466
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
 Shockingly, she doesn't conceptually get it.

467
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,320
 So she just thinks any of those are kind of generic

468
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,760
 and I'll put them wherever I want.

469
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,440
 And if not, and she is like, she's like an Enneagram eight.

470
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
 So she gets like very, very lit when things

471
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
 don't go her way.

472
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,280
 And she's throwing the thing up against the wall

473
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,120
 because she just wants the circle to fit in the star

474
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,680
 and vice, and she doesn't conceptually understand

475
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
 the point of the game.

476
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,380
 You take the shape that most resembles the hole

477
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,680
 that it can plug into and you put it in there.

478
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,400
 That's really what as Christians, we believe God

479
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,800
 has called us to in life.

480
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
 You take the shape of your life, who you are,

481
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,440
 how God has made you, how he's formed you,

482
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,800
 the gifts he's given you, and you plug into the holes

483
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,080
 of the problems in the world around us.

484
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,400
 You plug into the holes of the needs of the body of Christ.

485
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
 You take the shape, which is who you are.

486
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
 That's a star, like how God has formed you.

487
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
 And you look for ways to take the way that he's wired you,

488
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
 who you are, what you bring to the table.

489
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,600
 And I'm gonna be a part of meeting and bringing solutions

490
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 to problems in our world, to meeting and bringing solutions

491
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
 to problems at the church.

492
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
 And by shape, what do I mean by that?

493
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,160
 There's an acronym that actually lays out,

494
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,000
 'cause people ask all the time,

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
 like what am I supposed to do with my life?

496
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,820
 How do I know what God's calling me to do?

497
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,040
 I wanna give you a handhold, five letters.

498
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,560
 It actually spells out the word shape

499
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,420
 because you have been shaped by God.

500
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,080
 Each one of these reflects just a different way

501
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,640
 that you've been wired on purpose, for a purpose.

502
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 That'll give you some indication,

503
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,200
 man, maybe this is what I'm supposed to do.

504
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,240
 The first one is S, stands for your spiritual gifts.

505
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,800
 God has given, if you're a Christian,

506
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,480
 speaking specifically to Christians,

507
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,840
 in a way that I don't have time to go into,

508
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,440
 when you trust in Jesus, the Holy Spirit comes in your life

509
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,660
 and it's like they begin to flame up

510
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,240
 or magnify different gifts

511
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
 that may have been there all along,

512
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,300
 but he just pours gasoline on it and the fire gets bigger.

513
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,880
 So there's spiritual gifts that God has brought about

514
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,720
 inside of your life.

515
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,800
 Romans chapter 12 says this in verse four through eight.

516
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,280
 "For each of us has one body with many members.

517
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,160
 "And these members do not all have the same function."

518
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,760
 So it's like I got a body, I got hands, feet,

519
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,360
 everybody has one of those, that's what he's saying.

520
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,280
 So in Christ, we, though many, as Christians,

521
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,000
 form one body.

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,800
 Each member belongs to all the others.

523
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,960
 We have different gifts,

524
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,880
 according to the grace given to each of us.

525
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,220
 And then he lifts out some of them,

526
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,400
 it's not an exhaustive list, but he basically says,

527
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,840
 hey, if your gift is this, then do it.

528
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,960
 If your gift is this, do it.

529
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,760
 If your gift is prophesying or speaking

530
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,200
 a word of encouragement,

531
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
 then prophecy in accordance with your faith.

532
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,940
 If it's serving, then serve.

533
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,280
 If it's teaching, then teach.

534
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,500
 If it's encouragement, then encourage.

535
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,860
 If it's giving, then give generously.

536
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,360
 If it's to lead, do it diligently.

537
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,940
 If it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

538
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,340
 The first thing, how do I know what God's calling me to?

539
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,620
 You need to know your spiritual gift.

540
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,500
 Like what is the thing that, man, I'm just like, why?

541
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,180
 This gives me life.

542
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,900
 People in my life affirm it.

543
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,980
 I think it adds value to the body of Christ

544
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,900
 'cause that's the point of the gifts that are there.

545
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,540
 If you're interested in finding what yours are

546
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,080
 and you've never taken either some assessment,

547
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,980
 then they help you.

548
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,180
 You can go to watermark.org/porchspiritualgifts.

549
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,460
 Watermark.org, there it is,

550
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,140
 forward slash porch spiritual gifts, the first one.

551
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,380
 So how do I know my shape?

552
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,500
 How have I been shaped on purpose?

553
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,340
 What's God calling me to?

554
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,220
 The second one is a heart.

555
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,040
 So S-H, what are you passionate about?

556
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,500
 Like each of us has different passions

557
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,260
 and sometimes that gives us an indication that,

558
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,780
 hey, maybe that's a way that God is calling me

559
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,100
 to further use my time, my energy.

560
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,860
 Like I just, I lose sleep over that

561
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,480
 and I get so excited about being a part of that.

562
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,800
 Maybe you have a heart for sex trafficking.

563
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,780
 Dallas is one of the most sex trafficked cities

564
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,380
 in the country and you could join some of our friends

565
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,600
 that serve here at the porch

566
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,960
 that started a ministry called Reclaimed.

567
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,760
 That's all about fighting sex trafficking in the city.

568
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,220
 Maybe you have a heart for just international ministry

569
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,520
 and it looks like you joining us on an international trip

570
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,080
 where you go and get to be a part of our trips

571
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,320
 to Ethiopia or El Salvador and different places that we go

572
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,640
 and try to bring the message of Jesus.

573
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,080
 Maybe you have just a heart for inner city

574
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
 and man, there's so many different things

575
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,300
 that different partnerships and ministries

576
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,620
 where God has given us an opportunity to be a part.

577
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,920
 Dallas has one of the highest

578
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,200
 and so many of the cities listening

579
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,160
 have some of the highest poverty rates in the country.

580
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,280
 And as the body of Christ,

581
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,720
 we think that is our responsibility.

582
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,540
 We're gonna push back darkness anywhere that it's found.

583
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,720
 We're gonna fight for children who don't have parents

584
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,960
 to fight for them.

585
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,400
 And we wanna be a part of bringing life and health

586
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
 to the place in which we live.

587
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,280
 I don't know what breaks your heart

588
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,480
 or what gets you passionate.

589
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,840
 You're like, dude, I would just go all day about that.

590
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,680
 But that's a question.

591
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,840
 So what is your spiritual gifts?

592
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,200
 What are you passionate about?

593
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,480
 What abilities has God given you?

594
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,420
 That's the A, shape.

595
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,080
 What abilities, what talents has God given you?

596
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,200
 Some of you, you're gifted in construction

597
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,040
 and you need to think through,

598
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,720
 like man, how can I use the construction?

599
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,560
 This is what I do.

600
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,520
 I do nine to five.

601
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,600
 I make a great living.

602
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
 And how can I use the gifts that God has given me

603
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,120
 to be a part of bringing about transformation

604
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 for the sake of Christ in the city in which I live?

605
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
 'Cause you can do all kinds of things

606
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,180
 and there's ways you can serve,

607
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,700
 but there may be unique ways

608
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,240
 that you could use construction gifts

609
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,800
 if that's the industry that you're in.

610
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,300
 You could join our friends in Second Saturday,

611
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,160
 where every second Saturday here in this city,

612
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,120
 they go and they help rebuild homes

613
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,920
 in high poverty areas of the city,

614
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,320
 not for gain or financial gain,

615
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
 but to be about transformation

616
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,160
 and giving people a second chance

617
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
 and getting them off their feet.

618
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,680
 Maybe you're like, dude, I don't know.

619
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,920
 I'm not very good at construction.

620
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,360
 I don't know what I bring to the table.

621
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,200
 I'm an accountant.

622
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
 I'm just good at math.

623
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,140
 You could be a part of mentoring kids through Mercy Street,

624
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,000
 which is a partnership ministry that's in South Dallas

625
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,120
 where tons of kids need tutoring.

626
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,420
 And furthermore, you get a chance

627
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,560
 to be a reparenting mechanism,

628
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,640
 a source of love, encouragement,

629
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,480
 somebody who changes the trajectory of someone's life.

630
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
 And the gifts that you have,

631
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
 whatever they are, God has given you

632
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,480
 so that you would be a part of living on purpose

633
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
 'cause you've been shaped on purpose.

634
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
 P, personality.

635
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
 What is your wiring?

636
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,600
 So God, you need to evaluate,

637
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,800
 and what are my spiritual gifts?

638
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,640
 What's my heart?

639
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,460
 What am I passionate about?

640
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,300
 What abilities?

641
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,960
 Like what is talents and stuff do I bring to the table?

642
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
 And what's my personality?

643
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,160
 Like God, how you were made has been woven intentionally.

644
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,560
 God is not surprised by the fact that you're introverted

645
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
 or you're extroverted,

646
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
 and you need to begin to go, man, how could I best serve?

647
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,960
 Or what would make sense for me to serve

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,680
 and best do kingdom work?

649
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,480
 How can I be most effective for advancing the message

650
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,360
 and hope of Jesus to our world?

651
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,800
 In light of my wiring.

652
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,560
 Like you may be extroverted,

653
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,280
 and for you, man, there's places where you could go

654
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,660
 and you're like, dude, crowds don't scare me.

655
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,120
 I'll get up there and I'd love to get the mic

656
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,280
 and be in front of the children,

657
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,320
 and I'll be out rallying and just crowds, it's galore,

658
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,980
 and I wanna be with the Pilar.

659
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,440
 And that is a part of your personality.

660
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,040
 And you should look for opportunities

661
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 where those things align or for you to serve

662
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,880
 and for you to do that.

663
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,200
 And if you're introverted, there's no hope for you.

664
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,040
 And so I'm sorry.

665
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,760
 No, if that is it, dude, everybody,

666
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,080
 everyone's all across the board.

667
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,120
 And so for you, you may be like,

668
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,680
 hey, I don't wanna be with massive crowds,

669
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,000
 but I wanna be in small groups.

670
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,920
 I love having more intentional conversations

671
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
 in a smaller environment,

672
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,460
 whether that's a small group or a one-on-one.

673
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,280
 If you're like, no, I can't talk to anybody, coronavirus.

674
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,020
 We've even got a notes writing ministry.

675
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,840
 You can write notes from home.

676
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,800
 If you're that, and hopefully you're gonna work

677
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
 on being able to talk to people,

678
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,640
 'cause that's pretty important,

679
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,160
 but whatever your personality is,

680
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
 God has shaped you that way.

681
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,240
 And so leaning and asking the question,

682
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
 how can I be most effective?

683
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,600
 And then finally, your experience.

684
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
 This is a big one.

685
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,260
 Your experience and your story is a part

686
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,020
 of how God is shaping you for purpose.

687
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,960
 Even the things that were not according to his will,

688
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,880
 maybe things that were done a part of you

689
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,040
 that clearly weren't a part of his will.

690
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
 Maybe it's sexual abuse.

691
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,680
 Maybe it was an abortion decision that you were a part of.

692
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,440
 None of those things are hindrances or problems for God

693
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,160
 to use and maximize and advance his kingdom through you.

694
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,480
 They can be platforms.

695
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,560
 Some of the best ministries we have around here

696
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,640
 are men and women who've experienced those things.

697
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,540
 They're a part of our story,

698
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,520
 where sexual abuse was a part of their past,

699
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
 and now they're leading ministries

700
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,860
 and caring for other people who have that same thing.

701
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,280
 Same thing with abortion.

702
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 Someone made a decision at some point,

703
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 and so if you're in the room and you're like,

704
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,360
 man, I can never tell someone about this.

705
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
 Some of the most effective ministers of the gospel I know

706
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,100
 have that a part of their story.

707
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,520
 Whatever your experience is, where you lived,

708
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
 all of that, God has shaped and is a part

709
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,320
 of shaping you on purpose to have an impact for him.

710
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,940
 Second thing we see from Esther,

711
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,600
 just like she was shaped in her story

712
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
 and involved being an orphan and being beautiful

713
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
 and brought about, is that she wasn't just shaped

714
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,440
 on purpose, she was placed on purpose, just like you are.

715
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,200
 That God placed her in the palace.

716
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,760
 He takes this woman and he plucks her

717
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,480
 out of wherever she was, out of her family's home,

718
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,380
 he puts her in the capital city,

719
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,720
 and then he does a beauty contest

720
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,280
 and he places her on purpose in the palace,

721
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,120
 and I love this, 'cause Mordecai sees

722
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
 what so often we don't see.

723
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,640
 Mordecai sees and he responds and he goes,

724
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,080
 can't you see, Esther?

725
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,800
 What if it's not random?

726
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,280
 What if all the moments in your life

727
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,520
 that you felt like, well, this is just so crazy?

728
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,880
 I'm now standing with 400 other women,

729
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,840
 I'm in a beauty contest, I'm told I can wear

730
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
 whatever I want and it's for a year,

731
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,560
 and now I'm in the palace, I didn't even think

732
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,100
 I'd ever get to go see the palace,

733
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,120
 now I'm living in one of the rooms in the palace

734
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
 waiting to meet the king,

735
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,620
 and then you win the beauty contest?

736
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,960
 Could it be?

737
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,840
 None of it was random, Esther.

738
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,600
 Maybe God has made you queen for just such a time as this.

739
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,640
 Don't miss your opportunity by failing to connect the dots

740
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 that he's put and placed you here on purpose.

741
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,520
 And that purpose is not for you to just be in the palace

742
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,280
 to advance Xerxes' kingdom.

743
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,800
 You're in the palace to advance God's kingdom.

744
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,340
 And he connects the dots in a way that so many of us

745
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,280
 fail to actually connect the dots.

746
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,440
 If I'm Esther in that moment,

747
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,320
 I don't know that I really think that it's clearly like,

748
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,280
 oh, this is clearly God, I think what you and I

749
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,740
 probably generally think, I think it's kind of random.

750
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,480
 Most of us, whenever we look at our job

751
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,340
 or we look where we live in our apartment complex,

752
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,300
 the family that we're a part of,

753
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,480
 we don't always understand and really connect the dots.

754
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,680
 No, you're there on purpose.

755
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,040
 And you think, no, I'm not.

756
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,680
 I'm on the second floor of the apartment building.

757
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,000
 I tried to get on the first floor.

758
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
 I'm still trying to get on the first floor

759
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
 and it's definitely not on purpose.

760
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,600
 If anything, it's the devil

761
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
 who has put me on the second floor.

762
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
 And you don't understand that God would say,

763
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,640
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

764
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,760
 You've been placed, you think it's random.

765
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
 You think that that other person,

766
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,000
 you were supposed to have a first floor

767
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,920
 and all of a sudden they moved it away

768
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,460
 and they ended up putting you next to that

769
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,100
 single widowed mom who lives across from you.

770
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,200
 You think it's random.

771
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
 It's not random.

772
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,780
 And could it be you're in the job where you are,

773
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,220
 today where you went to work,

774
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,680
 the people that you live next to,

775
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,260
 even the family members you have,

776
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,500
 all of it, God has placed you there on purpose.

777
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,940
 Don't fail to connect the dots.

778
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,340
 In Matthew chapter five,

779
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,980
 Jesus says one of the most profound,

780
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,720
 well-known statements from Jesus that we have.

781
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,500
 And he speaks to this audience of his followers

782
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,300
 and he says, "As my people,

783
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,120
 "you are the light of the world.

784
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,040
 "A city on a hill cannot be hidden.

785
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,780
 "No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket.

786
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,140
 "A lamp is placed on a stand where it gives light

787
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,820
 "to everyone in the house in the same way

788
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,580
 "let your good deeds shine out for all to see

789
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,260
 "so that everyone will praise your heavenly father."

790
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,900
 Dude, I love Jesus, brilliant.

791
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,220
 Here's what he just said.

792
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,820
 In this day and age, there would be like one light.

793
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,220
 There wasn't electricity, shocker.

794
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,540
 And so at that time, if you wanna have a light on,

795
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
 lights were really valuable, oil was really expensive.

796
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,980
 So typically every home had just one light.

797
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,020
 And whenever you would light that,

798
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,140
 you'd put it very strategically inside of the house

799
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,920
 in the middle or in the most strategic place

800
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,900
 to get the most light to light up the room.

801
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,640
 'Cause that was the source of any ability

802
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,140
 to see at nighttime.

803
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,780
 And he uses a comical example where he's saying like,

804
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,100
 hey, just like when you light something,

805
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,420
 you put it very intentionally someplace like nobody.

806
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,780
 And then he does something that his audience

807
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,780
 would have been like chuckling like, Jesus jokes.

808
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,020
 And he says, "No one would light a lamp

809
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,560
 "and then come over and light it

810
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,140
 "and then put a basket on top of it."

811
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,420
 His audience would be like, yeah, that's crazy.

812
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,520
 Of course he wouldn't.

813
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,820
 God doesn't light lamps and put them

814
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,500
 in random purposeless places and you're God's lamp.

815
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,900
 He doesn't just put it in places

816
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,780
 where he doesn't want it to shine on purpose.

817
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,740
 He's put you where he has,

818
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,820
 he's put you in the job you have,

819
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,940
 he's put you in the place that you live,

820
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,620
 he's put you in everything about your life.

821
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,860
 It's all purposeful and he's placed you where you are

822
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,340
 so that you would not make a paycheck

823
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,140
 or make rich people richer, so that you would go

824
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,060
 and you would spread the message of Jesus.

825
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,380
 He put a light there and you may be thinking,

826
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,500
 dude, you don't know my workplace is so dark.

827
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,240
 Like I don't have any Christians I work with.

828
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,740
 I mean, it is like, it's such a toxic environment.

829
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,000
 God put a light there, you.

830
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,520
 And the more that you can begin to connect the dots,

831
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,280
 that I'm not here to get a paycheck.

832
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,800
 I'm not here and my job is not just,

833
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
 hey, I'm an accountant.

834
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,920
 It's not my job today.

835
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,080
 My job is to be a Christian who is an accountant

836
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,160
 and comes and accounts numbers, but I am a light

837
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,080
 and I use opportunities to share the gospel.

838
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,300
 I try to spread the message and I try to be an example

839
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,120
 of what Christ calls me to do and how I work

840
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,160
 and I work hard, I keep my word.

841
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,880
 And I look for opportunities to point others to Jesus.

842
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
 That's what he said.

843
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,760
 Make sure you connect the dots, Jesus said to his audience.

844
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,440
 You're put on purpose where you are.

845
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,760
 And in doing so, hopefully if you believe that

846
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,840
 and you see that, you know that you're gonna help others

847
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,000
 through the way you live, connect the dots

848
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,020
 by seeing your good deeds and pointing

849
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,420
 to your heavenly father.

850
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,420
 Don't miss out on where you are and why God has you there.

851
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,120
 So many of you, tragically, many who are listening cantily,

852
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,600
 I just know it 'cause I see it every week.

853
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,580
 You're gonna give your 20s to chasing stupid, foolish things

854
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,520
 to chasing, trying to make a million dollars by your 30

855
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,140
 and you're gonna give your 20s to a goal

856
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
 that is far too small and far too dumb

857
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,680
 and he's placed you on purpose intentionally where you are

858
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,240
 and you think you're a financial advisor

859
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
 and you didn't even wanna have that job

860
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,880
 and God says, I moved all the pieces around

861
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,200
 to put you in that firm, to put you in that office,

862
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,640
 to put you in that school district for you to be a light.

863
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,560
 Are you taking advantage of living out your purpose?

864
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,880
 You were placed on purpose.

865
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,960
 And Mordecai, I love it 'cause he sees

866
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,240
 what Esther couldn't see.

867
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,520
 Esther, don't miss your moment.

868
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,040
 You're here on purpose.

869
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,200
 Don't lose sight for all the palace and privileges

870
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,380
 and making something of yourself.

871
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,580
 What a foolish thing to give your life to.

872
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,600
 How much more foolish for us who know Jesus,

873
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,080
 who see the bigger picture to spend your life

874
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,320
 and you're gonna spend it, you're gonna chase,

875
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,400
 you're gonna have everything the world would say is success.

876
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
 You may have a great house someday,

877
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,920
 you drove here in a Range or an Audi

878
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,260
 or whatever you drove here in, you're gonna get married,

879
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,980
 you got all the kids, you got that golden retriever,

880
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,240
 you got the life people would look at

881
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
 and be like, oh, that's so great.

882
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,800
 And if it doesn't involve you living out your purpose

883
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
 of knowing God and helping others to do that,

884
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,400
 you are wasting your life.

885
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,800
 And some of you get this and you're giving your life to that

886
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
 and you're living on mission and you see yourself as,

887
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,760
 man, I'm going to work every day.

888
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,580
 And do I love it?

889
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,520
 No, I don't always love what I get to do

890
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,360
 or I always love my job, but I'm going in there

891
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,360
 and I'm looking for opportunities to show Jesus

892
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,900
 the ultimate treasure or to show people

893
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,780
 the ultimate treasure of my life.

894
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,520
 It's not a paycheck, it's Jesus.

895
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,020
 I was interrupted today by a girl as I was walking by

896
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,780
 and she just grabbed me and said, hey, my name is Macy.

897
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,780
 And she said, last week you shared a story

898
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,860
 about a girl at that Taco Cinco,

899
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,460
 which I have a contract with Taco Cinco,

900
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,140
 I have to include it in every message, this Esther.

901
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,700
 So this will be number, no.

902
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,580
 And she said, hey, in that message you talked about,

903
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,980
 you went to that restaurant and you talked with Sarah

904
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,140
 and you're like, you shared the gospel with Sarah.

905
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:44,120
 And I didn't know that, but earlier that day,

906
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,680
 or I'm sorry, after that, that same day, unrelated,

907
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,900
 I had gone in and I'd shared the same gospel with Sarah.

908
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,780
 And then I came to the porch and I heard you talk about that

909
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,280
 and I just wanted you to know, like you said,

910
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,460
 I believe that was on purpose.

911
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,900
 And Sarah told me, I guess an hour or two

912
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,780
 after you guys had bumped into her,

913
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,300
 that I was the second person that had shared,

914
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,340
 that someone named David had earlier shared

915
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,260
 the gospel with her and that it was beginning

916
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,780
 to mess with her, that God would send two people

917
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,020
 on the same day to share the message of Jesus.

918
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,420
 And then I came to the porch that night

919
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,500
 and I just want you to know, it was on purpose.

920
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,120
 And that was just an example of somebody

921
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,540
 who doesn't work on staff at a church,

922
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,300
 who said, man, I see an opportunity,

923
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,380
 I'm gonna look for an opportunity to share the gospel

924
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,540
 and share the message of Jesus to someone I bump into.

925
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,820
 Here's what I wanna challenge you to do.

926
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,700
 This is about to make all the introverts uncomfortable.

927
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,020
 I want you to share the gospel with one person this week.

928
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,140
 I think the Apostle Paul would be embarrassed

929
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,180
 that I'm even saying one.

930
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
 He's like, what, one?

931
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,820
 Are you, like, one, what?

932
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,740
 I want you to share the gospel with one person.

933
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,180
 I want you to just try to get in the conversation

934
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,460
 and just say, man, hey, do you have a faith?

935
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,980
 Can I share my faith?

936
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,740
 Can I share just how God's at work in my life?

937
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,180
 And if you're like, no, I'll never do that,

938
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,340
 I can't get there, just invite 'em,

939
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,500
 you invite 'em to the porch next week,

940
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,740
 we'll share the gospel with 'em.

941
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,260
 But a better exercise for you to experience

942
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,380
 and live out your purpose, just open your mouth

943
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,420
 and share with someone around you.

944
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,540
 Get into a spiritual conversation, or at least try to.

945
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,980
 Try to look for that opportunity.

946
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,440
 And in doing so, living out your purpose,

947
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,140
 because God has placed you on purpose,

948
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,740
 he shaped you on purpose.

949
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,380
 The final point is that you can live your life

950
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,900
 and miss your purpose.

951
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,940
 You can live your entire life,

952
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,980
 and I hope you leave here with a concern,

953
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,100
 or a greater awareness.

954
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,260
 Every one of us is in danger of spending our life

955
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,380
 and never fulfilling the God-given purpose

956
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,220
 for which you were created, the reason you're here,

957
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,460
 the reason you're alive, and spending your,

958
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,340
 some of the most energetic, best years that you have in life

959
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,060
 and giving them to corporate America,

960
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,100
 giving them to the pursuit of a relationship

961
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,380
 that will never satisfy you in terms of a dating relationship

962
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,220
 or marriage relationship, pursuing anything

963
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,860
 that is detached from you, knowing God and walking with him

964
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,900
 and helping others do the same, not perfectly,

965
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,740
 but with other people in your life.

966
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,060
 And you're gonna spend some of the best years,

967
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,880
 and you're here tonight,

968
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,720
 and you probably won't even come back,

969
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,780
 but I hope you just hear me, you are wasting your life.

970
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,700
 You're wasting it.

971
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,620
 You don't have to, God doesn't want you to.

972
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,260
 And just like there was an enemy in this story

973
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,960
 who wanted to destroy the people of God,

974
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,420
 there's an enemy in your life and in our world named Satan.

975
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,980
 And he wants you to spend your years, your 20s, your 30s,

976
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,420
 your life, listen to me very closely,

977
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,700
 he doesn't want you to have an impact.

978
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,580
 He wants you to live for insignificant things,

979
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,500
 like how much is in your bank account.

980
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,420
 He wants you to live for the type of car that you drive,

981
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
 what other people think about you,

982
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,940
 how many followers you have on Instagram.

983
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,740
 That's the type of foolish, pointless, worthless stuff.

984
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,860
 He's gonna say, "You should pursue that."

985
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,000
 That's really what matters.

986
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,980
 Let's not get all crazy religious here

987
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,940
 and be really pushy about Jesus.

988
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,700
 Let's just kind of, I like to keep work at work

989
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,500
 and church at church and just kind of

990
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,660
 right down the fairway.

991
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,780
 Because he doesn't want you to have an impact.

992
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,380
 And Mordecai looks at her and he says something

993
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,280
 so brilliant.

994
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,900
 And it points to the fact that Mordecai knew

995
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,100
 the promises of God.

996
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,820
 Remember what he said?

997
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,140
 He said, and he got a message from her, he goes,

998
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,920
 "Oh, you're afraid he's gonna kill you.

999
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,400
 "You know you're gonna die anyways.

1000
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,520
 "And God is going to deliver his people."

1001
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,600
 Because Mordecai had read the book, he knew the prophecies.

1002
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
 He's gonna send a Messiah, which means the Jewish people

1003
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,800
 won't be annihilated.

1004
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
 Whatever Haman thinks and wants,

1005
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,480
 I don't know how it's gonna go,

1006
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,940
 but I know the rest of the movie here

1007
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,600
 and it's not gonna go like that.

1008
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,640
 'Cause Jesus hasn't come yet.

1009
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
 So he's gonna raise up a deliverer from somewhere else.

1010
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,360
 So I don't know if it's gonna be you,

1011
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,960
 but if it's not you, you can rest assured

1012
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,740
 somebody else is gonna step in the gap

1013
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,480
 and you're gonna miss out on your purpose.

1014
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,080
 And could it be he's placed you in this moment,

1015
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,600
 and I just want you to think about it.

1016
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,960
 I just want you to honestly think about,

1017
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,960
 could it be all the different things in your life

1018
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,620
 that may feel random, seem random, the places you live,

1019
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,420
 the people you sit in a cube next to,

1020
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,640
 could it be that God has put you there for a purpose

1021
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,600
 and he's placed you on purpose

1022
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,520
 and he's invited you to not miss out on your purpose

1023
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,560
 by sharing the message of Jesus with those people.

1024
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,380
 And it's not dependent on you.

1025
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,220
 If he wants the person in the cube next to you saved,

1026
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,060
 he's gonna save them.

1027
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,700
 Just like if he wants to save the people of Israel,

1028
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,300
 it's not dependent on you, but you can be a part of it.

1029
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,960
 And he's invited you to be a part of it.

1030
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,460
 What are you gonna do, Esther?

1031
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,420
 And I think the same thing is said to us.

1032
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,020
 How do you wanna spend your life

1033
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,860
 chasing what every story in Hollywood clearly reflects,

1034
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,820
 never satisfies?

1035
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,980
 Or actually walking with the God who does

1036
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,820
 and helping others in our world to do the same.

1037
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,480
 There's never been a time that I know of in my lifetime

1038
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,420
 where it's been more needed for the body of Christ

1039
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,200
 to step up and be part of living out their faith

1040
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,700
 and not a dead Christianity that checks the box

1041
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,060
 and I go to heaven when I die

1042
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,900
 and I'm not living for anything purposeless.

1043
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
 Or I am living for a life that's purposeless now.

1044
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,320
 There was a chance I've had recently

1045
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,260
 to coach my kids' soccer games, my son,

1046
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,280
 and he's four, so it's really intense.

1047
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,900
 And so we've got this team together and it's four on four.

1048
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,860
 So we've got these four kids

1049
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,100
 and we're part of the Red Knights.

1050
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,020
 We had our first game two weeks ago.

1051
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,120
 I don't wanna brag, but we went five and O.

1052
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,960
 And it's these four kids, or four at a time.

1053
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,000
 You know, it's a team of like seven,

1054
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,220
 but only four at a time can play

1055
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,860
 and two of them had to miss.

1056
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,820
 We had like five kids and we're playing the game

1057
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,860
 and there's one kid on our team, it was like not fair.

1058
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,680
 It made me like question genetics, wow,

1059
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,360
 really play a factor because this kid,

1060
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,900
 his name was Jacob and he was out there

1061
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,420
 and he was on our team and he's the reason we won five O.

1062
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,620
 He went hat trick style.

1063
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,140
 I mean, it was impressive, it was incredible.

1064
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,420
 And here's what made him different.

1065
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,360
 He wasn't bigger than anybody else.

1066
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,660
 He was actually a little smaller.

1067
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,620
 He just got the game.

1068
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,300
 He literally like understood, okay, I take this ball

1069
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,500
 and I go to that goal, right?

1070
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,960
 That's what I do and I don't use my hands, use my feet.

1071
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,940
 Got it, I'll do it.

1072
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,940
 And he would go and he'd run and he'd get the ball

1073
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,980
 and he would just run down the field.

1074
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,980
 And every other kid is still kind of like,

1075
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,980
 which goal and dandelion.

1076
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,700
 And Jacob is over there just like,

1077
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,820
 he's threading the needle and he just got it.

1078
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,060
 Like he can simply like, oh, I get the point of the game

1079
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,460
 and I can do it.

1080
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,020
 And then we had one kid on our team,

1081
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,260
 what's it called, little Johnny,

1082
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,060
 who the entire time, like we tried to get to play

1083
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,020
 and he didn't want to, he like sat on the bench

1084
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,140
 and he just wanted to eat goldfish.

1085
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,800
 And we're like, hey, we'll hold your hand.

1086
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,520
 We gotta get Jacob off the field.

1087
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,160
 He's destroying the other team.

1088
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,840
 Please, please give us something to tag in.

1089
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,120
 And he was like, no, I don't want to play.

1090
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,440
 And he sat and asked goldfish, we're like, hey,

1091
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,040
 your dad can come with you on the field.

1092
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,460
 And he just continued to not want to play.

1093
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,960
 And we just sat over there and he was really sad.

1094
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,440
 Like his grandparents had come, he was like,

1095
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,640
 hey, this is your time, come on.

1096
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,440
 And he's like got the cleats just hanging from the bench.

1097
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,440
 And in that moment, it was like, dude, what a contrast.

1098
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,580
 We have one who like clearly gets like,

1099
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,420
 this is the point of the game.

1100
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,540
 I know what winning looks like.

1101
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,760
 And then we have one who is like,

1102
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,900
 I don't want to play at all.

1103
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,460
 I'd rather just sit over here on the bench

1104
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,400
 and be comfortable.

1105
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,220
 What a perfect picture of the Christian life

1106
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,340
 for so many people.

1107
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,380
 Like, I think the decision for all of us,

1108
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,580
 for me every single day, it wakes up

1109
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,660
 and am I going to be Jacob?

1110
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,460
 Like I get the point of life, the game of life

1111
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,880
 is not to score goals in soccer,

1112
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,800
 it's to know God and help others do the same.

1113
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,040
 Anything else I give my life to that doesn't involve

1114
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,480
 a focus of how I can further do that is foolishness.

1115
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
 And I know how to win the game

1116
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,800
 and I know how to play the game.

1117
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,760
 'Cause that's the point ultimately of the game

1118
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,960
 or called life.

1119
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,280
 And then the other one of just someone

1120
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,440
 who sits on the sideline and is like,

1121
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,560
 I don't really want to do that.

1122
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,920
 I just want to sit here and eat goldfish.

1123
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,800
 And so many of you, it breaks my heart.

1124
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,320
 You're going to spend your 20s eating goldfish.

1125
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,180
 And those goldfish look like you pursuing

1126
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,460
 tender relationships and getting drunk on the weekends

1127
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,740
 because you're trying to cope with the fact

1128
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,700
 that you don't actually like your life.

1129
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,660
 And you spending your 20s not plugged in

1130
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,380
 and serving the city and using your time and energy

1131
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,120
 to help other people, but serving your time,

1132
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,300
 working a 90 hour job because that's just what

1133
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,300
 somebody told you you have to do in order to make it.

1134
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,940
 And by make it, they mean make a lot of money.

1135
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,220
 And you are wasting your life

1136
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,140
 and you're going to sit on the bench.

1137
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,680
 If anything in your life, or you are sitting on the bench,

1138
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,400
 if things in your life are not connected to

1139
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,640
 and pointed to your purpose of knowing God

1140
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,560
 and helping others know him.

1141
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,920
 And Mordecai in a way that I love,

1142
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,840
 says, don't you see it, Esther?

1143
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,960
 None of it's on coincidence or none of it's random.

1144
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,040
 And he has you here and he has you here.

1145
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,240
 And it's all on purpose.

1146
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,340
 The question is, are you going to connect the dots and see it?

1147
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,840
 In conclusion, you've been shaped on purpose.

1148
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
 You've been placed on purpose.

1149
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,360
 And it is possible for you to miss your purpose.

1150
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,720
 And let me close right here.

1151
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,860
 Esther ends up and we're going to look at her story.

1152
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,280
 She ends up stepping out and despite what it costs her,

1153
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,280
 she goes and she's a part of delivering the nation.

1154
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,060
 We'll look at more of the story in the weeks ahead.

1155
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,460
 What happens next is that God uses her

1156
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,940
 in this incredible miraculous,

1157
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,260
 like, wow, God showed up kind of way.

1158
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,620
 The nation is delivered.

1159
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,280
 And that day of destruction that Haman had rolled the light,

1160
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,620
 the dice, the Purim, to be a part of selecting,

1161
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,080
 this is the day that will be destruction,

1162
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,940
 became the exact day that God brought deliverance.

1163
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,640
 And to this day, since the story of Esther,

1164
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,420
 the Jewish community today, they still do it,

1165
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,600
 have celebrated a festival called Purim.

1166
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,860
 Do you know this?

1167
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,740
 It's a festival called Purim.

1168
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,880
 It's like one of the, I think,

1169
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,740
 funnest Jewish festivals that there are.

1170
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,340
 I don't know how really fun ones there are,

1171
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,220
 but it's a one that is a mixture

1172
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,460
 of like Halloween meets Christmas.

1173
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,540
 You wear costumes, kids get candy,

1174
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,500
 you end up getting food,

1175
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,540
 and you give gifts to one another.

1176
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,800
 It's like really exciting.

1177
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,640
 So there's some people,

1178
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,180
 there's festivals all over the place,

1179
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,620
 of people to this day celebrating Purim.

1180
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,060
 And it's a reminder, and remember that, hey,

1181
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,060
 the day of destruction has become a day of deliverance

1182
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,220
 for us, that our God showed up and he delivered.

1183
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,520
 And to this day, it's celebrated.

1184
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,340
 It's also a day that Jesus,

1185
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,500
 when he was on the planet, celebrated.

1186
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,580
 'Cause it started 500 years before Jesus

1187
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,100
 and has continued for 2,500 years,

1188
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,580
 and we're told in John chapter five, verse one,

1189
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,500
 that Jesus showed up and he attended this festival,

1190
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,940
 this feast in the midst of the city.

1191
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,540
 And it's a feast that's not told the name,

1192
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,500
 but it's a month before Passover, which is Purim.

1193
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,240
 And inside of that festival, he goes around,

1194
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,820
 and there's a man he sees that's lame.

1195
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,380
 It's John chapter five.

1196
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,460
 And he's been laying there,

1197
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,820
 and it says he's been unable to walk for 38 years.

1198
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,900
 And Jesus goes up and he says,

1199
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,860
 "Hey, do you wanna get well?"

1200
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,180
 And the guy says, "Yes."

1201
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,980
 And he says, "Get up and walk, take your mat and go."

1202
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,860
 We're told that the festival was also on a Sabbath.

1203
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,780
 So all of a sudden, these religious people come,

1204
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,220
 and they're like, "Hey, God had a rule.

1205
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,220
 "You can't heal people on Sabbath or do work."

1206
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,660
 And Jesus responds, "God is always working,

1207
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,080
 "and so am I always working."

1208
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,100
 And then he says something else

1209
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,620
 in the midst of this festival, Purim,

1210
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,620
 celebration of destruction becoming deliverance.

1211
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,620
 I tell you the truth.

1212
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,780
 Those who listen to my message,

1213
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,020
 and they believe in God,

1214
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,580
 who sent me to have eternal life,

1215
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,060
 they have eternal life.

1216
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,740
 They will never be condemned for their sins.

1217
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,300
 They have already passed from death to life.

1218
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,620
 And I assure you a time is coming.

1219
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,020
 Indeed, it's here now.

1220
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,140
 When the dead will hear my voice,

1221
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,820
 the voice of the Son of God, and they will live.

1222
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,620
 He says, "It's a festival."

1223
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,180
 There's an even greater deliverance that has come

1224
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,300
 for those who are heading to destruction,

1225
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,940
 and that deliverance comes from me, Jesus.

1226
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,380
 And then he says something that's so beautifully profound

1227
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,060
 and appropriate and relevant to Esther, and he says this,

1228
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,180
 "To this group of Pharisees who didn't understand

1229
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,620
 "they were talking to me,

1230
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,860
 "who didn't understand they were talking to God,

1231
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,780
 "and they would miss God because they put religion

1232
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,380
 "in place of relationship,

1233
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,100
 "you search the Scriptures

1234
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,220
 "because you think they give you eternal life.

1235
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,260
 "The Scriptures point to me,

1236
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,980
 "yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life."

1237
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,020
 Jesus tells this group, "All of the stories,

1238
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,060
 "everything, every verse, every story, every moment,

1239
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,700
 "all of the things that you read in the Scriptures,

1240
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,260
 "they all were to point to me."

1241
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,020
 Esther, Genesis, everything points to him.

1242
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,620
 And the even greater deliverance that came,

1243
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,020
 because just as great as the deliverance

1244
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,060
 that this day of destruction, Purim,

1245
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,580
 that's the name of the celebration.

1246
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,820
 Every Purim festival, we celebrate

1247
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,540
 that the day was to be destroyed, we were delivered.

1248
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:12,120
 On a cross, Jesus would sow an even greater day

1249
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,580
 that looked like the world would be destroyed,

1250
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,820
 that destruction was headed,

1251
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,580
 there would be an even greater deliverance,

1252
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,580
 and all of Esther ultimately points to Jesus.

1253
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,780
 And this life is not random,

1254
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,180
 and all of it was woven together,

1255
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,380
 and Jesus says it's about him.

1256
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,980
 The story, your life, all of life, finding him.

1257
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,720
 And do you know what's crazy?

1258
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,460
 In case you're going, "Man, what a coincidence."

1259
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,500
 Do you know what today is?

1260
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,080
 Today is March 10th, 2020.

1261
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,220
 I know, shocker.

1262
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,060
 It's Purim.

1263
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,660
 Today, millions of Jewish people around the world

1264
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,140
 are celebrating Purim.

1265
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,860
 And the festival that, hey, there's a God out there

1266
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,060
 who, despite the fact that we deserve destruction

1267
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,980
 or headed towards destruction,

1268
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,780
 has provided deliverance for his people.

1269
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,700
 And they have missed the fact,

1270
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,100
 and Jesus says you have missed

1271
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,860
 that the greater deliverance has come through me

1272
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,540
 and your life, and it's not random.

1273
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,700
 And if you don't know Jesus,

1274
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,500
 tonight is the night where the God who's there

1275
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,060
 has brought you to this place, and it's not random.

1276
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,260
 And he brought you in here,

1277
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,940
 and you think it's just 'cause a friend invited you

1278
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,300
 and they told you it would be,

1279
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,900
 you thought it was a restaurant you were headed to,

1280
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,720
 and you ended up in a church,

1281
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,540
 and it's because God has been pursuing you,

1282
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,820
 and it is not random, and he's extended that.

1283
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,820
 And anyone who believes in him will never be condemned.

1284
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,540
 They will be delivered from destruction.

1285
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,460
 And they have already passed from death to life.

1286
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,220
 And in a moment, if you trust in Jesus

1287
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,660
 as the payment for your sin,

1288
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,260
 that is what Christianity is about.

1289
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,940
 God saved the queen, God saved you,

1290
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,060
 he saves everybody the same way,

1291
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,860
 through putting faith in Christ,

1292
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,420
 his death on the cross, that he came and he died

1293
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,400
 as a payment for your sin, and he was buried

1294
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,840
 and he rose again to give you eternal life,

1295
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
 an abundant life now, and it is not random,

1296
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,320
 and whether you believe me or not,

1297
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,400
 someday you will, and you'll see it.

1298
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,320
 And all of it was God weaving and bringing it together

1299
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,600
 so that you would know he hasn't forgotten you,

1300
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,420
 he loves you, he cares about you.

1301
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,640
 And to the rest of us, he's saying,

1302
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,880
 I want you to experience your purpose.

1303
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,200
 You gotta believe it.

1304
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,600
 You were placed and shaped, and it's on purpose.

1305
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,800
 And you don't have to like your job

1306
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,860
 or even like your apartment,

1307
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,880
 but you gotta know you're there on purpose,

1308
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,520
 or you're not gonna live out your purpose.

1309
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,360
 Let me pray.

1310
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,600
 Father, I pray for the millions of Jewish men and women

1311
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,640
 who are of the same bloodline of the God

1312
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,600
 that we sing songs to, the God that we worship,

1313
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,480
 the God, our savior, Jesus.

1314
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,520
 I pray that they would hear, as you say in John 5, verse 25,

1315
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,360
 the voice of the son of God, and they will listen and live

1316
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,960
 and be delivered from an even greater destruction

1317
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,760
 that life is, apart from being connected to you.

1318
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,460
 I pray now for anyone here

1319
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,880
 who has never received that free gift,

1320
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,480
 this would be their moment.

1321
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,840
 Would you help us who have to live lives of purpose

1322
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,280
 and connect the dots to what you're doing

1323
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,480
 and where you have us.

1324
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,560
 We worship you in song, amen.
