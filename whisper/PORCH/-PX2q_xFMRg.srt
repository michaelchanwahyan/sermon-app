 [MUSIC]

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 All right, Porch, how we doing? We doing okay? Oh man, it's so great to see you.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 If this is your first time to the Porch, welcome. We're really glad that you're in the space.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Normally this is the moment where I would shift real hard and we would go straight to this.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 We're going to do that in a moment.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I think that God might not be done with the moment we just came out of.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I just felt like the presence of God moving in a really powerful and palpable way here amongst us.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And I'm a firm believer, like, we're not the weekly entertainment.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Like, you're not coming here so you can listen to me preach and watch us worship.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 No, God is the reason we show up into this space every single week.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 His worship is the object of our affection. His word is the object of our attention.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And the wonder of God is the object of our enchantment.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And so I want to give you a moment right now just to pray for yourself.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I don't even know what to prompt you to pray.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You just need to pray. I just feel a deep sense from the Lord that you're supposed to take a moment

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 and just bow your head and say, "God, I sense you near. Would you meet with me now?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Would you unlock God? You might already be opening up here this evening."

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So can we do that together? Would you be willing?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Again, we believe that God meets with us here.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 He can meet with anybody, anytime, anyplace, but we want to give you a space right now to meet with Him.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Even if you haven't clicked into the reality that He's here and He's wanting to meet with you.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So take a moment and just pray for yourself in whatever way you feel led,

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 in whatever way that you're wanting for.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Ask God to give you more of Himself.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 [silence]

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Oh God, the silence is so good.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It's a good God to sit in the stillness of a moment like this

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 and to know, God, that while it might feel so empty, it could not be more full.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It is full of you.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 God, we desperately want to meet with you.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And we're grateful, God, that that desperate longing is not unmet by you.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 You feel the same way.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So God, would you meet with us now?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I don't know what you want to do,

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 but God, I want you to do whatever it is.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 We love you.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And it's in Christ's name that we pray these things.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Amen.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Well, hey, it's great to be with you.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I'm really excited for tonight.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I want to give a special shout out to all of our friends that are tuning in online.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 We have not forgotten about you.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 All of our Porch Live locations that are tuning in from all over the place.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I mean, it's amazing what God is doing in this room,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 but He is doing similar things in rooms just like this all across the country.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Special shout out to Porch Live, Great Or Lafayette, Fort Worth, and Dayton.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Would you put your hands together for all of our friends that are tuning in online right now?

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 We love you. We see you.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And if you're ever in Dallas, come and spend a little bit of time with us.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Well, I don't know if there's something in your life that you've sworn to yourself

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 you would never, ever do.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 But there is one thing in my life that I've said,

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "Man, there's no way I would be caught dead doing that."

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 You want to know what it is?

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I have sworn to myself that I will never, ever run through an airport.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Not that there's something wrong with that.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I'm sure people that are doing it have a really good reason to do so.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I just can't think of one.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I think that there's plenty of reason to make your way out of that type of situation

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 if you would just prepare in advance.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Buy your tickets early, make sure your parking is booked,

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 download your mobile boarding pass, show up,

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 and if you're checking bags, give time for that.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Just know, man, TSA is probably going to be a little bit tricky.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Something's going to go wrong.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Someone's hair product or shampoo, body wash is going to signal something

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 because they didn't get the right size liquid container.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's going to stymie the rest of your progress through that space.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's not that difficult.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And yet, as luck would have it, my wife and I, when we were in Frankfurt, Germany,

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 in the middle of a layover between one flight to the next,

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 found ourselves in a situation, Alexa, which I never would have invited upon myself.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 You see, we landed, and in the midst of our layover, we knew,

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "Okay, we've got like 45 minutes," which is brief, but it's also convenient

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 because we know exactly where we're going.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 We've prepared very well. We know the gate that we're moving to.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 We check one more time. We exit our plane. We start walking our way.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And right as we get to the gate that we thought we were going to be leaving from,

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 I look up, and I do not see the name of the city to which we are flying to.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Cue the appropriate airport panic that I've never wanted to feel in my life.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You see, somewhere between us landing, checking our boarding pass,

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 and then deboarding the plane, our gate got updated.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And yet, we did not know about it. So we had made our way to the wrong place,

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and yet in this moment, having casually strolled our way to where we were then,

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 where we originally thought we were going, we realized there's nothing casual

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 about the situation we're in now.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 We have got not 45 minutes, 10 minutes to get from one terminal to the next,

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 lest we miss our flight altogether.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 What do you think we did in that moment?

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 We ran. 1,000% we ran.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But we tried to do that thing where you sort of like run/walk

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 because you don't want to draw attention to yourself

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 or be considered as odd to the rest of the surrounding people.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And yet what we realized as we did that is it wasn't exactly working.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 People were looking at us, and we stood out,

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 and we realized we're not getting where we need to go in the time that we need to get there.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And so what we decided to do is we shifted gears.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 We went into high drive, and we picked up our luggage.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It was no longer working to roll it.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 We were pushing through crowds. Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And we were racing through the airport yelling, "Go, go, go!"

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Like paratroopers deployed into a drop zone.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I mean, this was our situation because though our destination had not changed,

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 our situation had changed.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And because our situation changed,

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 everything about the way we moved in that moment changed as well.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Why do I tell you that?

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Because I think that we're living in a very special time in history

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 where God is moving in a uniquely different way.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And yet the window to be a part of it is slowly closing.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And that should change everything about the way we move.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 What are you talking about, Kylan?

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Well, I don't know if you're aware,

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 but there is something genuinely amazing happening all across

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 not just our country, but the globe.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And it goes by the name of revival.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Maybe you don't like that name.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 People have a variety of responses when they hear the word revival.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Some are very hopeful. Others are very gullible.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Some are very skeptical. Some are very cynical.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I don't know what your response is or what other word you would prefer.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 An outpouring, an awakening.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 What we can agree to is something is happening right now in our modern moment.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 If you don't believe me, then just listen to this.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The Barna Group recently reported that 66% of Americans

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 have made personal commitments to Jesus that are important in their lives today.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 The reason that's so meaningful is because that is up 12% in just three years

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 from when it was at its lowest mark

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 over the course of Barna's 30-year tracking history of the same statistic.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Three years. It rose to 66%.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 According to their estimation, this is the clearest indication

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 of a meaningful spiritual renewal in the United States, which is amazing.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And yet what's even more amazing is its young adults

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 that are leading the way on this particular movement.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And even more amazing is its young men.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Crazy to think that that's true.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But it's not just happening here in America.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 This is also happening all over the globe, like in the UK.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Church attendance has quadrupled amongst young adults.

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But catch this, it has quintupled amongst young men,

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 continuing the trend that we're seeing here in the States.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 In Australia, more than 800,000 people have moved from identifying as irreligious

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 to Christian according to the national census that they took last year.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 800,000 people.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 With 70% of the millennials in Gen Z

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 that was associated within that group

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 saying that their Christianity is now paired with monthly church attendance.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That they don't just believe in God, they want to belong to his people.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 In France, the total number of baptisms has increased by 45% in just one year.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 The vast majority of which are young adults.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 In Finland, 62% of young boys, which is the youngest faction of Gen Z,

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 but will be young adults soon,

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 they agreed to believing in the existence of God.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Doubling that number from where it was five years ago.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And according to the Wall Street Journal,

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 there has been a 50% increase in Bible sales since 2019.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 What does all of that mean?

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 We are in the midst of what experts are calling a quiet revival.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Perhaps you prefer that term instead.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And yet it's not just sweeping the nation,

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 it's not just sweeping the globe,

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 it's also sweeping into Hollywood.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Because we have seen people, the likes of which Hulk Hogan,

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Gwen Stefani, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Kat Von D, and Denzel Washington

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 have all been baptized in just the last couple of years.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And still others, people like Andrew Hubberman,

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 affirming his faith in God to jelly roll,

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 openly claiming a heart for Jesus,

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 has led us to this one irrefutable fact

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 that God is moving.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 He's moving.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He's actually making a meaningful movement.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He's been doing this all over the course of history,

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 and yet what's significant about the moment we find right now

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 is we can see it, not just here and not just within ourselves,

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 but out there amongst them as well.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 So we need to ask ourselves,

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 how does this change the way we move in response?

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 If God is moving,

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 how then does that change the way that I move through my life?

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Because I think it should.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I think that Jesus has a far bigger vision

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 for the life he's come to give you than you may well know.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And it doesn't matter where you fall on the spectrum of spirituality.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I think that this is true for Christians and non-Christians alike.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I think that for many Christians,

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 we fear that we'll go too far spiritually,

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 that we actually don't go far enough spiritually.

190
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 For non-Christians, I think we look at our lives and we say,

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 "Man, it's good as is."

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And yet how much better might it be if you actually know Jesus?

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Think about what he has done.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 He left heaven.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 He came to earth.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 He lived the perfect life.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He resisted every inch and ounce of temptation imaginable.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And then he moved to the cross.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 He died a horrific death, a death that you deserve.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And yet he decided to take up his own life by way of resurrection.

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And then he sent power from on high to fill those that might believe in him.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Why do you think he did all that?

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Just so you might be a little bit more moral?

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Just so you might be a little bit better person than the average human being out there?

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 No!

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 That's not why he's done it.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Jesus has done this because he wants more for you.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 The question that you need to answer is if you want more for yourself.

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Do you want more for yourself?

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 If you do, then I want to show you where to begin tonight.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And the place that we're going to do it is in the book of Hosea.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So if you have a Bible, you can go ahead and crack it open and you can turn there.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Don't worry, I'm going to talk and give you time to find that book.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Hosea chapter 10.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 While you're turning there, we're starting a brand new series tonight

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 that truthfully has been a long time in the making for me.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 If you were around at the beginning of our year, the very first porch even,

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I stood on this stage and I walked in fully anticipating that God was going to let me preach

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 something completely different.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And yet he sidelined that something for a moment that would come later on.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What is that something?

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's this series.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And when is that time?

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It's right now.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 We firmly believe that God is wanting us to engage in the current cultural moment

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 and the spiritual surge we're seeing in the lives of people all over,

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 but particularly our generation.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And yet in order to do it adequately, we can't just give a single week.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That would not be enough.

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 We want to give multiple weeks, week after week, talking into this idea

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 because what we believe is that true revival doesn't just happen through a powerful moment.

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 True revival happens through persistent movement.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It happens through a persistent movement.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Let me explain it to you like this.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 We've all gotten motivated and up in arms about something that we want to learn.

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Right?

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I want to learn to play the guitar.

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I want to learn to get in shape.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I want to learn to knit.

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Like that's a thing right now.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Crocheting is kind of in.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 We can get motivated for a moment.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And maybe we even act on that motivation.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And yet what we find is often it doesn't stand the test of time.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I remember when I was a young boy, I was a horrible reader.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And yet I thought the idea of reading was so very noble.

247
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I wasn't great at it.

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 You know, whenever it came to our AR points, if you know, you know,

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I chose to read every picture book and not any literary classics.

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And yet what I realized is leaders are readers.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And so if you want to be a leader, you better become a reader.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And I decided, you know what I'm in, I will do this.

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And so I would go to the book bear.

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I would peruse the books.

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I would pick those which looked to be the most sophisticated and savvy for my development.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And I would work through them until I grew disinterested.

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And they started to collect dust on the shelf.

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 What finally made the difference?

259
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 The difference was I moved from motivation to dedication.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I stopped worrying about the moment of, of the moment where I cared to make a move.

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And I started thinking about the movement that needed to happen in me.

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And if I actually wanted to develop as a reader.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And so I started setting time aside.

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I started making sure that my calendar was cleared.

265
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I started giving up other hobbies so that way I could grow in this area.

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I didn't need more motivation.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I needed more dedication.

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Revival and outpouring of the spirit and awakening work of God.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It requires the same thing.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Sure, it can begin in a, it can begin through a powerful moment in a room like this.

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 But it lasts through a persistent movement in hearts like yours.

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It can't just happen like a spectacle.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It needs to be deeply spiritual.

274
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And that's what I want to help you learn.

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I love the way that Mark Sayers says this.

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He says personal renewals begin in the hidden places.

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Eventually this interchange of heart will overflow out into external lives.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Creating a potential for renewal in the social world around us.

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 To put that very simply, widespread revival begins with internal renewal.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Meaning you don't find revival by searching for it, by banging the emotional drum,

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 by guilting people into engagement.

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 You find revival by seeking renewal.

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 A vibrant faith, an intimacy with Jesus, a greater delight in the gospel.

284
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And a deepening of your personal dependence on him for what only he can do.

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So how do we do that?

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 How do we actually invest in our personal individual renewal?

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Well, it's going to take some time to teach you.

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But that's what this series is and that's what the next coming weeks are.

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 I want to help you take step by step by step in your personal renewal.

290
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 That way you might experience more of God in your life.

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 But before we can get where you want to be, we need to assess where you are.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 We need to talk about what is happening before we consider what will happen.

293
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Which means we need to talk about your heart.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I don't know how you feel about that idea.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And yet this is the appropriate place to begin.

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And it's exactly what Hosea starts talking about in Hosea 10 verse 12.

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Look at verse 12 with me.

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 One verse is all we're working tonight.

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He says, "So for yourselves righteousness, reap steadfast love.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Break up your fallow ground for it's time to seek the Lord that he may come and reign righteousness upon you."

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You see, Hosea is saying to the nation of Israel exactly what God is saying to us tonight.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Now is the time.

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It's time to make a move.

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It's time to take a stand.

305
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It's time to deepen down in your depth.

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And the place that we begin is by farming.

307
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Which probably caught you a little bit off guard.

308
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 It's not exactly the most helpful, relevant reference point for us, Hosea.

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Something that would have been better is refresh your feed.

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Share your story.

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And then accept the followers that come in kind.

312
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 That would have been a more modern translation of what's happening here.

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And yet what he is saying is not out of touch, but very in touch with the people he's speaking to.

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Because the nation of Israel, they were an agrarian society.

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 They were great at working the land and harvesting a crop and taking up its yield.

316
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 They were familiar with all of the work it took to actually bear fruit from the earth.

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 As any good farmer knows, and these people would have known as well,

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 it does you no good to plant seed unless you have first plowed soil.

319
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 That's what Hosea means when he says, "Break up your fallow ground."

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 What's fallow ground? Fallow ground is dormant ground.

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 It's ground that has gone undisturbed.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It's filled with weeds and thistles and rocks and debris.

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It's been untouched.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And there's a good reason for it.

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The nation of Israel would do this because they would want their soil

326
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 to replenish in terms of its nutrients, to prevent disease.

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And you've learned this in grade school science or social studies.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's called crop rotation, people.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 What do you do with fallow ground?

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You've got to break it up because though it is nutrient rich,

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 it is hard as a rock.

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It has to be loosened.

333
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It's not accommodating for planting.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 It will not give you any growth because it is already overgrown.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 When my wife and I lived in Houston,

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 we had an amazing front yard in our very first home.

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Amazing front yard.

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Like when it was freshly cut, this thing looked like a green pillow top mattress.

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And I loved it.

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That is until we had a very harsh winter.

341
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And by way of the seasons change, our yard got wrecked.

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Like disease and decay and death just gripped it

343
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 and started choking the life out of it.

344
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 So what did I do?

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 When springtime rolled around, at the appropriate moment,

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 just as Jose is saying,

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I decided to break up that hardened ground,

348
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 to till up our soil,

349
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 so that way I could lay new sod,

350
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 the closest thing to farming we get in a big city.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 If the soil was not soft, the sod would not take.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 In the same way, you have to break up

353
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 your hardness of heart

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 if you want renewal to take root.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Hardheartedness must be broken up.

356
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Your first point.

357
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 If you want to be spiritually renewed,

358
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 if you want more of God,

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 then your hardheartedness has to be broken up.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Let me ask you, why do our hearts grow hard?

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 For one of three reasons.

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 They either grow cold, calloused, or cluttered.

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Cold, calloused, or cluttered.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 What does it mean to have a cold heart?

365
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 A cold heart looks like apathy to the things of God

366
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 or indifference to the things of Jesus.

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Like we just don't care anymore.

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 We don't care.

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And we might not admit that out loud,

370
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 but if your quiet times feel more like

371
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 you're paying Christian membership fees,

372
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 or if it feels like your prayers

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 are bottomed out of any of their emotion,

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 or if you're showing up to church

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 and it feels more synonymous with an inconvenience

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 to deal with the parking than actually a blessing

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 to walk in and experience the worship,

378
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 then you might have a cold heart.

379
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Your heart might be hard in the coldest of ways.

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So how do you get yourself warm again?

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 You come close to the source of heat.

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 That's how you do it.

383
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Like if you're out in the cold,

384
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 what's the right thing for you to do?

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 It's to move out from the cold and into the warmth.

386
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And yet what you know is that

387
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 it's not an instantaneous process.

388
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It takes time.

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Okay, so then let's just talk.

390
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Like what is the source of warmth

391
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 that you need to near yourself to?

392
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 The scriptures are abundantly clear.

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 It's the word of God.

394
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's the word of God.

395
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 When Jesus approaches two of his disciples

396
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 on the road to Emmaus,

397
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 they say in Luke 24, verse 32,

398
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us?"

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 While he talked to us on the road,

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 while he opened to us the scriptures.

401
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 If you want your heart to get hot,

402
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 the way that that works is you sit in his word.

403
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 You don't just do it casually.

404
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 You do it consistently.

405
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 You make an effort,

406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 every effort to spend time near this book

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 where you not only read,

408
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 but he actually speaks.

409
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 That's gonna warm your heart up.

410
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And if I can just make a recommendation,

411
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 if it feels like, man,

412
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 every time I pick this thing up,

413
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 there's nothing in it for me,

414
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 then I would encourage you go and sit in the Psalms.

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Now my spiritual elites in the room are like,

416
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 of course you would recommend the Psalms.

417
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 That's what everybody wants to read, including Jesus.

418
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Jesus did not quote any other book

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 more than the book of Psalms.

420
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And Jesus also had the hottest heart of all.

421
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Like he was boiling inside for the glory of God

422
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 to a point where he never faced a coldness of heart

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 because he sat in the word of God

424
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 as the word of God himself.

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 That's the first thing.

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And the second thing is your heart might be calloused,

427
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 which looks like a cynical or suspicious heart.

428
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Why are you cynical or suspicious?

429
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 More than likely because you've been hurt.

430
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I like the way John Ortberg says this

431
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 in his book, "Faith and Doubt,"

432
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 "Scratch the surface of any cynic

433
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 "and you will find a wounded idealist underneath."

434
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Some of you have endured some pain.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 You have suffered some hardship

436
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 that just does not agree with this fact

437
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 that God is a good and loving God.

438
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Like you've had something done to you.

439
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You've had something taken from you.

440
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 You've lost something dear or someone dear

441
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 you've wanted to fit in,

442
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 and yet you felt totally left out.

443
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I don't know what it is, but whatever it is,

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 it has left your heart hard in the most calloused of ways.

445
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So how do you break up the callousness?

446
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 You remind yourself of the gospel.

447
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You preach yourself the gospel every single day.

448
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I remember being a young man and someone saying,

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "You should preach the gospel to yourself every day,"

450
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and it never actually resonated with me.

451
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I was like, "Dude, what do you mean by that?"

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Like, just repeat this thing over and over and over.

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 What I realized is, no, the gospel is the central element,

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 the core component to everything I do

455
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 as I walk with God and I move through life.

456
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So when I read the word, I'm looking for Jesus.

457
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I want to connect this to Jesus.

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 When I'm engaging with people,

459
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I want to see them the way Jesus sees them.

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Whenever I'm by myself,

461
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I want to think the thoughts of Jesus.

462
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I'm bringing the gospel into my life,

463
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and better, I'm bringing my life into the gospel.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 You think about the gospel.

465
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It breaks up your callousness.

466
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Ezekiel 36, 26, it says,

467
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 as it's reported in the new covenant,

468
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "I will give you a new heart,

469
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 "and I will put a new spirit in you.

470
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 "I will remove from you your heart of stone

471
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 "and give you a heart of flesh."

472
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 If that's what he did in Christ,

473
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 shouldn't we think more often about Christ?

474
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 The last one is your heart can get cluttered.

475
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Everyone's got a junk drawer at home, yeah?

476
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Show of hands, who has a junk drawer?

477
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Yes.

478
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I don't know where we adopted this

479
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 as a national interest,

480
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and yet everybody has one

481
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 because everybody has things they don't know where to put.

482
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Anything and everything finds its way into this junk drawer.

483
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Let me just tell you, your heart is not a junk drawer.

484
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Your heart is not a junk drawer.

485
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It should not be cluttered with anything and everything.

486
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Instead, it should be set aside very specifically

487
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 for something, that thing being Jesus.

488
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You see, we often give the space within our hearts

489
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 away to other things,

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and what we need to do is we need to take that space back.

491
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Some of you, you've given your hearts away to success.

492
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 You desperately want to make it in life.

493
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 You want to make a difference.

494
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You want to make yourself matter,

495
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and so what you have chosen to do is give your heart away to success,

496
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 and yet what success is doing is it is taking your heart from you.

497
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It's not giving you any life whatsoever.

498
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Same things happen in relationships.

499
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 You're giving yourself over to a relationship.

500
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 You think that that relationship is going to give back to you,

501
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 that it's going to benefit you in some sort of blessed way,

502
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 and yet it often doesn't if it's not rooted in Christ,

503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and if it's not pointing towards the covenant

504
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 that he has designed for his people to embody.

505
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I could keep going, but what you know is what Proverbs 4:23 says.

506
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "You should keep your heart with all vigilance, vigilance,

507
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 for from it flow the springs of life."

508
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 If you feel that your heart is hard,

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 then empty it of what it does not deserve to be filled with,

510
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 and fill it with what it deserves.

511
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Stop taking your phone to bed.

512
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 It's getting you into too much trouble every time you take it there.

513
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Refuse to talk to your boyfriend or your girlfriend

514
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 until you talk first to God in the mornings.

515
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 He's your first love, so visit with him first and foremost.

516
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Try planning your day from your knees.

517
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I promise you'll realize you're not as in control as you think.

518
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Don't drink just because it's how you unwind.

519
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Go for a walk.

520
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Don't call your friend because you need to complain about that person.

521
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Why don't you call someone to encourage them instead?

522
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Be willing to remove that which is making your heart hard,

523
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 that which is making your heart cluttered,

524
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 and instead fill it with what will make it right.

525
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 We must break up our hard-heartedness.

526
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 As one of my former pastors would always say,

527
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "Kylin, the hard work is the hard work."

528
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Some of you need to do the hard work tonight.

529
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Some of you do not need to leave this room.

530
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 You need to sit as long as it takes,

531
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 not to finish the job,

532
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 but just to break the ground.

533
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Not to scratch the surface,

534
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 but to actually impact it for a difference

535
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 and begin to till up the soil of your soul

536
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 because until you do, you will not be able to sow into your satisfaction,

537
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 which is where Hosea goes next.

538
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 He says, "Sow righteousness. Reap steadfast love."

539
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Something I think we could all agree that we want in life is to be approved of.

540
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 We want to be accepted by others.

541
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 We want to be loved in this world.

542
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Listen, we're not wrong for wanting that.

543
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 That's not a bad desire.

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 You're not wrong for wanting for it.

545
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 You're wrong in light of where you might be searching for it,

546
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 which was the case for the nation of Israel in this moment.

547
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 At the time that Hosea is prophesying here,

548
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 the nation of Israel was being led by King Jeroboam II.

549
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 On the surface, Jeroboam's reign was marked by

550
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 prosperity and national security.

551
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He expanded the borders of Israel to a place that had not reached the same extent

552
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 until the time of Solomon himself.

553
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 He had great political prowess.

554
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 He had successful military campaigns.

555
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But underneath it all, Jeroboam II did what was evil on the side of the Lord.

556
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He led the nation into idolatry for 40-plus years.

557
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 What was the result of that?

558
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 The people of Israel, they were searching for satisfaction in all the wrong places.

559
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 They were looking for love and acceptance and approval in all the wrong places.

560
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 They were worshipping at the feet of false gods instead of the one true God.

561
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 They were gratifying their sinful desire as opposed to the desire of the Spirit.

562
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And what they found is they were, instead of investing in the renewal of their spirit,

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 they were investing in the rejection of God's spirit.

564
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 What's the point that Hosea is making?

565
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 It's our second point.

566
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You reap in life what you sow in the soul.

567
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You reap in life what you sow in the soul.

568
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Let me explain what I mean.

569
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Several years ago, I was at the gym and I was training legs.

570
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Fellas, don't skip leg day.

571
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 As I was doing it, I felt my back tweak.

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And so, being a wise and responsible adult, I put the weights down,

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 picked up a yoga mat, and I said, "I'm going to stretch this thing out."

574
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So I make my way over, and I start to stretch everything out,

575
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 and I feel fine by the end of it.

576
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I get in my car, I go home, I've got a couple of boxes to unload at the house,

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and as I'm putting these boxes down, I bend over to set one to the ground,

578
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and I went with it.

579
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 My knees buckled, I found myself face down on the ground,

580
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and I genuinely could not move.

581
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I had fallen and I could not get back up, yet I had no life alert to save me.

582
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I army crawled my way into the house, where I laid on a couch, immobile, for three days.

583
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It was at that time that my wife, being the voice of wisdom,

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 looked at me and said, "We should do something about this."

585
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 "No, baby, it's going to be fine. Just let me sleep it off."

586
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 "No, really, we should do something about this. I can't keep changing your clothes for you,

587
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 because you can't bend over to pull your pants up."

588
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It was a moment of great humility.

589
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And so we went to the local urgent care.

590
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Walked in, they gave me a steroid shot, they also recommended physical therapy.

591
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I was back to 100%, so I went back.

592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Ten months later, I found myself back on the ground.

593
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Why?

594
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Because I did not sow into my health.

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 I didn't go to physical therapy.

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 I didn't do my stretches.

597
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I didn't work on my mobility.

598
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I sowed into my hurt.

599
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 I went right back to doing what I had always done.

600
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Listen, you cannot sow the same seed and expect a different result.

601
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 You cannot sow the same seed and expect a different result.

602
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 That's not how this works.

603
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 If you want to experience more of God in your life,

604
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 then you need to make different decisions in your life.

605
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 So let me ask you, do the hard work of evaluating where you sit.

606
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I won't ask you to speak it out loud, but I do want you to speak it into yourself.

607
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 What are you sowing into right now?

608
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Like, are you sowing into following that person's account?

609
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And all it's doing is reaping envy.

610
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Are you sowing into your success and all it's doing is reaping exhaustion?

611
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Are you sowing into that guy and all it's reaping is shame?

612
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Are you sowing into those friends and all it's reaping is regret?

613
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Are you sowing into control of your life and all it's reaping is anxiety?

614
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 There are better things to sow into.

615
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 There are better things.

616
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Things that may not produce what you want right now.

617
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Let's just get real.

618
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Things that we call spiritual disciplines are not immediately gratifying.

619
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 They don't give you what you want right now,

620
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 but they will give you what you want most.

621
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 So sow into those things.

622
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 That's how the author of Hebrews talks about it.

623
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 He says in Hebrews 12, 11, "For the moment, all discipline seems painful,

624
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 but rather than pleasant,

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness

626
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 to those who have been trained by it."

627
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Church, there is a better seed to sow.

628
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Sow into your holiness.

629
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Let there be no concealed sin, but only confessed sin.

630
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And then repent of it.

631
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Like that thing which you walked towards because you thought,

632
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 "Man, this is going to give me life. This is the source of joy."

633
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 No, you realize it's not actually giving you any joy.

634
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Turn back and move towards that which will give you joy.

635
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Sow into your humility.

636
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Like pray to God.

637
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And not just prayers where God would be nice if you showed up,

638
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 but prayers where God, if you don't show up,

639
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 then there's going to be no plausible explanation

640
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 for how I'm going to make it through this thing.

641
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 I'm totally dependent. I'm lost without you, God.

642
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I'm fully and utterly hopeless unless you show up.

643
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 He will show up.

644
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Invest, sow into your happiness.

645
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Not happiness from God,

646
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 but happiness, the happiness of God.

647
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Pursue purity, not just in a dating relationship.

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 I don't know where it kind of got sidetracked.

649
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 This purity is only synonymous with dating.

650
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Purity is living a guiltless life.

651
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Give yourself a reason to live in such a way where you're above reproach.

652
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Don't just pursue personal purity. Walk in obedience.

653
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Believe that it's not just bad things that feel good.

654
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Good things feel good.

655
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And they leave you well rewarded.

656
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Celebrate life.

657
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Not life as the world knows it, but life as Christ has come to give it.

658
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And then sow into your hunger.

659
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 God, I pray that this room would be characterized by that word most of all, hunger.

660
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 God, we're hungry for you. We want for you, God.

661
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We have tasted and seen that you're good, and God, we want more.

662
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Give us more, please.

663
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Treasure his word.

664
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 In his presence, find that he is as delightful as his word tells you he is.

665
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 The decisions you make, they have the power to make you.

666
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Listen to me.

667
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 But they also have the power to make us.

668
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 That's what this is communicating in Hosea 10-12.

669
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 It says, "For it is time to seek the Lord that he might reign righteousness upon you."

670
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 You see, according to Hosea, the call to break up your hard-heartedness and to sow into the soil of your soul,

671
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 it not only reaps the reward of your increasing nearness to God,

672
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 but it also brings about his increasing nearness to us.

673
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 That's what it's saying.

674
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 It's saying, do all these things. Break up. Sow. Reap.

675
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 "For it is time to seek the Lord," why?

676
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 "that he might reign righteousness upon y'all."

677
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Yes!

678
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 James 4-8 says, "Draw near to God and he will draw near to you."

679
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 You may hear that and be like, "Yes, I know."

680
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 But do you grasp the promise of that?

681
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Draw near to him. And he will.

682
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 He will draw near to you.

683
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Like, you want for him, and guess what? He's already wanting for you.

684
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 He will come near.

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Hebrews 11-6 says, "Whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists,"

686
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 that he rewards those who seek him.

687
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Isn't that amazing?

688
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 That as God sees you and you and you and you and you and you

689
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 all pursue personal spiritual renewal,

690
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 he actually brings about widespread revival.

691
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 That as you come to him, he not only comes to you, he comes to us.

692
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And he produces that which we cannot produce.

693
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 That which we can't awaken on our own.

694
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Which we can't birth through some kind of technique or some entrepreneurial strategy.

695
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 That we can't stand up here and be so amazing enough

696
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 that you're actually going to repent and revive,

697
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 not just in a moment, but over the course of time,

698
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 generating a movement which the halls of history will remember.

699
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 We can't do that. I can't do that!

700
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Nor can I be expected to do it.

701
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 God alone can do that.

702
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 And the way he does it is he works through you

703
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 in your individual renewal.

704
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It's time to seek the Lord, not settle for less.

705
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Your third point.

706
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 It's time to seek the Lord and not settle for less.

707
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 It's time to seek him, not casually like we were

708
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 when we walked to the wrong gate at the airport.

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 We had all the time in the world, but urgently,

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 when we realized we were at the wrong gate and there was a different gate,

711
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 that if we didn't make it there quickly, we were going to miss our opportunity.

712
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Because the right time to respond with urgency isn't after it's too late.

713
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 I learned this lesson the hard way.

714
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 When Brooke and I were dating,

715
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 I was horrible at managing my time.

716
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 I was awful at it.

717
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 I often underestimated how long it would take to get to her place,

718
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 and I would overestimate how long it would take me to drive there.

719
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And what it did is it produced a high frequency of apology.

720
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Like I found myself constantly looking at her saying,

721
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 "I'm so sorry. I'm horrible at managing my time."

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 You see, the issue there is I was acting in urgency,

723
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 driving as fast as I could to get to her house after it was too late.

724
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 The solution is acting with urgency before it's too late.

725
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Realizing that the time is now, and you should respond appropriately.

726
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 The time to see God isn't after our present moment has passed,

727
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 because God is moving right now.

728
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 We have to seek him right now.

729
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 "Porch, seek the Lord while he may be found.

730
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Call upon him while he is near.

731
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Porch, behold, I'm doing a new thing.

732
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Now it springs forth. Do you not perceive it?

733
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I will make a way in the wilderness, in rivers, in the desert."

734
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Friends, let me just ask.

735
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Haven't we settled for less long enough?

736
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Haven't we settled for less long enough?

737
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Like there's more on the table. Don't you want that?

738
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Don't you want a relationship with God that's more?

739
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 That's more than just a faith of fact.

740
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 But it's actually a faith of feeling.

741
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Like don't you want a relationship with God

742
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 that's not just intellectually impressive or emotionally charged?

743
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 It's experientially powerful.

744
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Don't you want that? I want that.

745
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 That's why I'm doing this. We're preaching this.

746
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I remember when we, Brooke and I, made our way to Dallas, Texas to consider God.

747
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Would you even bring us here?

748
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Is this where you want us to go?

749
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 You're doing a good thing where we are, God.

750
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 I'm not just like ready to up and leave.

751
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Like I love where we're at. You're doing a good work.

752
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 You're already moving there, God. Why would you bring us here instead?

753
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 You must prove to me that it's here you're moving as well.

754
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 And as I preached on the stage for the very first time,

755
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 and I came back and I preached on the stage for the very second time,

756
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 I found that God was moving here.

757
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And as I was processing that reality, God, you're moving.

758
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 In that soft, still voice that the Spirit only speaks,

759
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 I sensed Him say, "Kylin, you haven't begun to see me move.

760
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 You have not begun to see me move.

761
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 There's more in this room than you realize.

762
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 But only I can unlock it.

763
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Call these people to me.

764
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Tell them that it's time to seek after me.

765
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 And remind them I have already sought after them first."

766
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 You see, we're convinced that we seek a God who has sought after us,

767
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 for He sent Jesus Christ Himself.

768
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 We break up our hard-heartedness,

769
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 for Christ has come to give you a new heart,

770
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 one that is worthy of protecting.

771
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 We reap in life what we sow in the soul,

772
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 for Jesus has reaped in death to save your soul.

773
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And we seek the Lord, not settling for less,

774
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 for Christ sought you,

775
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 because He wouldn't settle for anything less Himself.

776
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 He wanted you.

777
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 But I'm not worthy, Kylin.

778
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 You are correct.

779
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 You are not worthy.

780
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 But He is.

781
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 And by saving people who face the very worst of odds,

782
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 He gets greater glory.

783
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 He moves towards the people that do not deserve Him to move towards them,

784
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 that we might be affirmed, "Yes, God, we need You.

785
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 We cannot save ourselves.

786
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And, God, we want You.

787
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 We want You because You would come for us."

788
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Let us be a people here at the porch that call out our need

789
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 and call out our desire that You, God, and You, God alone,

790
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 are worthy of seeking and we're willing to seek right now.

791
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 It's time, porch, to take these things as serious as they are.

792
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 It's time to believe beyond where we've been.

793
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 It's time to make a change in our own lives.

794
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 I will boldly ask you, if you will not make a change in your own life,

795
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 then make some space instead,

796
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 because I want this to be a room filled with people

797
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 that are desiring after God,

798
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 taking Christ's claims seriously,

799
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 and walking in hot pursuit after Him,

800
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 believing that, yes, life everlasting will be amazing,

801
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 but life everlasting has come crashing into our present moment,

802
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 and we can be a part of it.

803
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 I don't want to simply look back and realize,

804
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 "Man, the window was open."

805
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 I want to realize that window was one I lived within.

806
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 I don't want to look back with hindsight and say,

807
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 "Man, God really moved there."

808
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 I want to live into this moment and believe that,

809
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 "Man, God and I were both there together.

810
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 This is what's on the table."

811
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 God, please, would You work in these people

812
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 and bring them to a place where they take God, You, seriously.

813
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 This message is imperfect.

814
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 We, God, on this stage are imperfect,

815
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 but God, You are so perfect.

816
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 They do not need us. They need You.

817
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 We, God, are not worthy of wanting,

818
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 but You, God, are worthy of wanting.

819
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 And God, I pray You would know here in this place,

820
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 we hunger for You.

821
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 We want for You, God.

822
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 We see what You're doing across the globe,

823
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 and we want it right here.

824
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 We don't want to just look back, God, and see what You did.

825
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 We want to live now, God, and experience it ourselves.

826
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 At the right time, Christ, You died for the ungodly.

827
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 It is our time to live for the only God worthy.

828
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 It's to Your glory we pray, in Jesus' name, amen.

829
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Hey, porch, you can stand to your feet.

830
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 We're going to go back into a little bit of worship,

831
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 but some of you, you really need to work through

832
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 and process whatever it is God is stirring up in you.

833
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 Now is the right time to do it.

834
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Now is the time to break up the hard soil.

835
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 We're here to help you do the work.

836
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 We would love to pray with you if we can,

837
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 but let this not be a moment where we feel awkward about making a move.

838
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 He is on the move.

839
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Let us respond in kind.
