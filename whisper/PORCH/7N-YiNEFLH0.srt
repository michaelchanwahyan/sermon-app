1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Good evening and welcome to the porch.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,000
 I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of relationships.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,880
 Can we cue some music please?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,720
 From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds, estranged

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,320
 relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,680
 So how do we relate?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,120
 To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,640
 relationships.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,840
 This is After All, the Relationship Series.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,040
 All right, Porsche, how are we doing?

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
 We doing okay tonight?

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,400
 Man, it's good to see y'all.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,080
 Gosh, you know, we were talking about this as a team.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,820
 It's actually a frequent point of conversation, but we realized like on Tuesday nights or

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,080
 whatever night it is that you may be possibly streaming this at a later time, you could

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,480
 do anything else.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,040
 Yet you chose to show up here, which one leads me to just say, thanks.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
 Like we really great.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,520
 We're really grateful that you would choose to trust us with your evening.

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,240
 But also here's what I want you to know.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,360
 Maybe this is like rhythmic for you.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 It's habit.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,240
 Like you always come to the porch, you show up with your friends, you sit in the same

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,920
 seats, but maybe this is a new thing for you.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,240
 Anybody here for the first time tonight?

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
 Welcome.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
 You know, it's great to have you in the space, but what you need to know, regardless of whether

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,160
 it's your first time, you're here all the time is we genuinely believe that God knew

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,480
 you'd be here and God has something very specifically in store for you.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,040
 The question is, are you willing and ready to receive it?

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
 You willing and ready to receive it porch?

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,680
 Yeah, man, I think it's going to be awesome.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,800
 Special shout out to our porch live locations that are tuning in with us tonight.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,040
 It's so great to have y'all with us as always.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,760
 Special shout out to porch live, greater Lafayette and Atlanta.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,720
 We were grateful that you guys are here.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 I was thinking about the, I was thinking about tonight and the topic of dating, which you

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,680
 couldn't tell is where we're going this evening.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,720
 And I couldn't help but be reminded of my first job working in ministry with college

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
 students.

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,360
 It was an amazing job, like loved so many different aspects of the job, but easily the

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,160
 best thing that I got to do is I got to work with a group of student team leaders, 20 college

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,600
 guys, college girls, that they were the highest of character and the highest of caliber you

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 could imagine.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,920
 Like these are people that they not only loved Jesus, which was true, but man, they, they

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,660
 served faithfully and they worked really hard and they adhered to our values and they adopted

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
 our mission statement.

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,640
 They could repeat it on command and they met our expectations and they virtually never

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,400
 caused any kind of problems.

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,360
 That is until love entered into the equation because I remember inevitably one of the guys

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
 would start crushing on one of the girls, violating one of the oldest rules in the ministry,

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,960
 which was no team leader dating.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
 It was not allowed.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
 We'd been down that road before.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,280
 We had learned our lesson in the past because love makes people do really dumb things.

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 You know it.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,520
 You've done something dumb yourself in the name of love.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
 Like it impairs your judgment.

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,360
 It stirs up your emotions.

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
 It unleashes your unpredictability.

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,240
 And I knew this was the case.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,400
 And yet regardless, every single semester, like clockwork, I would always get a text

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,120
 message from one of my guys that said, Hey man, do you think we could meet up and talk

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
 sometime?

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
 And I knew it.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
 I could call the shot.

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,840
 I knew what they were coming to visit with me about.

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,320
 And yet regardless, I would agree to meet with them where we would sit down and over

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,400
 a cup of coffee and during our conversation, they would, they would tell me about their

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,920
 unprofessed, undying love for one of the girls on our team, which they knew was not allowed.

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,120
 And yet even still love would lead them to have that conversation and they would do crazy

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,240
 things like I had one guy come up and beg me, please, man, like, I just, I don't know

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
 what to do with these feelings.

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,680
 I want so badly to pursue her at another guy that tried to appeal to my logic and reasoning

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,600
 as if I would be an understanding individual.

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,000
 Another one tried to move around me, not even tell me about it, just kind of swerve and

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,380
 move on the slide towards his target.

78
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,320
 But we definitely found out what was happening there.

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,480
 I even had one guy like bow up to me and tell me this is stupid.

80
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,240
 And I looked at him and said, tough luck, brother.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
 Like, you know, this is just the way it is here.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
 Love, it has a powerful effect on people.

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
 Amen.

84
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
 Yeah.

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,840
 And again, these are some of the best young leaders I knew.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
 Like I handpicked them myself.

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,040
 They were consistent and reliable and self-sacrificing.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,760
 You could trust them to run a ministry to thousands of college students.

89
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,240
 And you could also trust them to run your grandma to the grocery store.

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
 They were tremendous people.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,440
 But the minute they caught feelings or love injected into their system, they became completely

92
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,320
 and totally unpredictable.

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,360
 You see, love has a powerful and polarizing force.

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
 In this room alone, just the mention of the fact that we're going to talk about dating

95
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,600
 tonight, there are a dozen of different responses across this room altogether.

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,760
 Some of you have shown up here very specifically for this topic.

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
 Finally, they're going to talk about it.

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,880
 Others of you have already leaned over to your friend and said, "Hey, you want to get

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 out of here?"

100
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,340
 Like, we've heard this thing before.

101
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,320
 This is a frequent flyer for the porch.

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,720
 Some of you have approached this evening cautiously optimistic.

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,880
 Maybe I'll learn something new.

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,480
 Others of you are hopelessly romantic, hoping I will give you the keys to unlocking that

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,280
 secret that will lead you to the love of your life.

106
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,840
 Amen.

107
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
 Some of you have been burned.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,680
 While others of you are trying to stoke a fire tonight.

109
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,000
 The idea of love, it's true.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
 It sends us all in different directions.

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,920
 But regardless of what direction it sends you in, the truth is we all want it.

112
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,940
 I could bore you with the statistics.

113
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,240
 But if you look across the nation, by and large, young adults want love.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,120
 They desire romance and relationships.

115
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,200
 So how do you then know which one to choose?

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,920
 If everybody wants a relationship, if everybody is eager and looking for a committed romantic

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,640
 partner, how then do you look across the vast array of people that are wanting for the same

118
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,920
 thing and know which one you should choose?

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,040
 Which person is worthy of your pursuit?

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,560
 There's so many options out there.

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,120
 So how do you evaluate who you should date?

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,620
 Well, you can't make the right call with the wrong criteria.

123
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,040
 And if you just do a little bit of research, which you don't need to, I've done it for

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,720
 you, what you see is that we're operating often under the wrong criteria.

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,400
 As just one example, Tinder recently reported that young adults named personal growth and

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,500
 happiness as their number one priority when searching for a romantic partner, which sounds

127
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,720
 really reasonable and even very good.

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,300
 And yet what you realize when you hear that the desire for a romantic partner, according

129
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,440
 to user subscriptions on Tinder, is that I would find personal growth and happiness.

130
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,120
 What you realize is people aren't looking so much for a relationship as much as they're

131
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,040
 looking for a rescuer.

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,680
 Like we're looking for someone to fill up the vacancies inside of me, to give me that

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
 thing which I've always wanted for and I know I need.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,920
 And yet what you're doing is you're putting a pressure on people that they cannot measure

135
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,440
 up to nor support the weight of.

136
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,920
 Because people aren't meant to be your rescuer, Jesus Christ is.

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,280
 You see, what we find when it comes to dating is we're seeking a partner, but the reason

138
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,520
 for our seeking is we're just really seeking for ourselves.

139
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,040
 Do you see it?

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,800
 And because this is the case, we find ourselves in all sorts of different romantic relationships.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,520
 Like yes, there's the true traditional relationship model where it's one guy and it's one girl

142
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,440
 and they're sitting at dinner and they're getting to know each other and they're asking

143
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,520
 casual questions, but in our society, what you realize is that's just not the norm anymore.

144
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,200
 Like you see polyamorous dating where people are really open in a relationship and they're

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,680
 inviting multiple parties to be a part of the romantic dynamic.

146
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,640
 You see that people have friends with benefits where really I don't have any romantic interest

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,680
 in you at all, but I'm co-opting you and trading in sexual favors so that way I can scratch

148
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
 that itch.

149
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,680
 And so many of you are codependent in your friendships because you don't trust the opposite

150
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 sex.

151
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,280
 And so what you want to do instead is you want to find that emotional need met by way

152
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,720
 of a trusted friend.

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,120
 If you look at our generation across America, what you see is a more diverse and wider array

154
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,000
 of romantic constructs today than at any other point in human history.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,720
 And yet here's the thing, despite the diversity, there's one commonality as to why we seek

156
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 these.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,880
 And it's because we're self-seeking, which isn't loving, right?

158
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,080
 That's what Paul says when he writes to the Corinthians in chapter 13.

159
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,680
 He says, love is patient.

160
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
 Love is kind.

161
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
 It does not envy.

162
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
 It does not boast.

163
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
 It is not proud.

164
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,040
 It does not dishonor others.

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,160
 It is not self-seeking.

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,840
 True love doesn't self-seek.

167
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,600
 And so instead of tonight walking in and just talking to you about who it is you should

168
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,440
 date, what I want is I want to flip the script.

169
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:44,480
 I want to turn the tables and I want to ask the question, should someone date you?

170
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,960
 Because the reality is to just ask, who should I date?

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
 That's self-seeking.

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
 But to say, am I dateable?

173
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
 That's self-searching.

174
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,080
 And so we're going to do some self-searching tonight.

175
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
 Okay, porch.

176
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,840
 And the way that we're going to do it is we're going to look at Paul's letter to Timothy

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 in 1 Timothy.

178
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,280
 So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out.

179
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
 You can turn to 1 Timothy.

180
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,040
 We're going to be in chapter 4, but here's just what you need to know.

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,440
 We are going to be all over the place this evening.

182
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,240
 We've got scripture from across the book.

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,280
 1 Timothy chapter 4, verse 12 is a good place to put your finger because it's the verse

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,680
 we're going to anchor in and build our argument from for the rest of the evening.

185
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,160
 And yet we're going to be all over the grid.

186
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
 But this is what it says.

187
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,120
 1 Timothy 4, chapter 4, verse 12.

188
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,280
 It says this.

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,720
 Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,080
 conduct and love and faith and in purity.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,040
 Now admittedly, this is not your normal passage for a dating talk, but it's the perfect passage

192
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
 for an evening of self-evaluation.

193
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,240
 Because what Paul is saying is he's looking at young Timothy and he's saying, "Hey, there

194
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,520
 is a standard that I want you to meet.

195
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,560
 And that standard is godliness.

196
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,960
 And that standard of godliness, it's relevant for every area of your life, including your

197
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,660
 dating life."

198
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,080
 So what does godliness have to do with dating?

199
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
 Great question.

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
 Here's the answer.

201
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,160
 A meaningful connection to God is the source of meaningful connection to other people.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,320
 A meaningful connection to God is the source of meaningful connection to other people.

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,280
 If you want to have a meaningful relationship with another person that actually descends

204
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:41,160
 to the depths of delight that you can find in romance, then you need a meaningful relationship

205
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,000
 with God.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
 He's the one that designed it.

207
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
 So learn from him if you want to love at its greatest length.

208
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,800
 And according to Paul, as he talks about godliness, his idea is that true godliness is reliable

209
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,040
 enough to trust and it's desirable enough to follow.

210
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
 True godliness is reliable enough to trust and it's desirable enough to follow.

211
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
 This is the main point of the night.

212
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,600
 So if you're taking notes, here it is.

213
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,440
 This goes on top and then we're going to have three points that go underneath it.

214
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,720
 Just look at the standard he gives Timothy for how he should live his life.

215
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
 He says, "Hey, set an example.

216
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
 So what's an example?

217
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,360
 An example is a standard worth following.

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 That's what an example is.

219
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
 I don't know about you, but when I learned the alphabet at the ripe age of three, the

220
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,800
 way that I learned the alphabet is by replicating an example.

221
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,920
 I saw for my teacher a standard that I should meet.

222
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,280
 What needed to be true of that standard?

223
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,520
 It needed to be reliable enough to trust.

224
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,360
 Like when I received that this is the way an A is supposed to be shaped, I didn't question

225
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
 if it was legit or not.

226
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,800
 I just believed it was reliable enough to trust, but know that it was desirable enough

227
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 to follow.

228
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,400
 That I was willing to actually emulate the pattern I saw before me.

229
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,560
 Okay, my little hand is making the A out.

230
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
 I was willing to follow that example.

231
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,440
 That's what Paul is saying to Timothy.

232
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,480
 He's saying, "Hey, live in a way that's reliable to other people.

233
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,040
 That people will look at you and they'll see someone that's steady and movable and constant

234
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,800
 no matter what the shifting sea of circumstance brings in your life.

235
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,480
 But don't just be reliable.

236
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
 Give an example that's desirable to follow.

237
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,800
 That people will look at you and be like, "Man, look at him go.

238
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 I want to go that way.

239
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,600
 I want to live like that."

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,040
 This is what we should do with our lives.

241
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,320
 We should walk with a kind of godliness that sets an example before people.

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,480
 Why does that matter to dating?

243
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
 Because you want this in dating.

244
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 You want this.

245
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,440
 You want someone in a dating relationship that is reliable enough to trust.

246
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
 That no matter what comes, man, they're trustworthy.

247
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,720
 I can depend on them.

248
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,800
 They're constant.

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 They're immovable.

250
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,840
 I'm not going to wake up one day and they're going to be gone.

251
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,240
 That's not something you have to worry about because there's a godliness, a reliability

252
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
 to them.

253
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
 But then also, they're desirable enough to follow.

254
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
 That, "Man, I see the way you're living your life, the direction you're going, and I want

255
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 to go with you.

256
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,520
 I want to link arms and run into the future together, whether it's for a short while or

257
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,640
 it's until death do us part."

258
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,560
 If you want to date, then your life should look like this.

259
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,840
 It should set a standard worth following.

260
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,680
 So how do we know if that's happening or not?

261
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,160
 How do we assess the quality of your dateability?

262
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,160
 Well, first, you study your behavior.

263
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
 You study your behavior.

264
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,880
 That's what Paul means when he says, "Set an example in speech and in conduct."

265
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,760
 When you take those two things, speech and conduct, and you pull them together, what

266
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,840
 they encompass is all observable human behavior.

267
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,280
 Emphasis on observable.

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,360
 The reason that's important for us to know is because you make your dating decisions

269
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 based upon what you see and what you hear about somebody.

270
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
 This is important for us.

271
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,520
 So when my wife and I lived in Houston, we had a Nest security camera.

272
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,000
 The kind of notifications it would report to me were always on the basis of two things,

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,200
 the sounds it heard and the movements it saw.

274
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,280
 Now what was important to know is those notifications could instigate within me a variety of different

275
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
 feelings.

276
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,720
 If I got a notification that my Nest camera saw someone pick up my trash can, which had

277
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
 blown over, that would instigate feelings of gratitude.

278
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,280
 Thank you.

279
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,600
 If I got a notification that my Nest camera heard a sound, a crashing blow in the middle

280
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,280
 of the night, it would leave me panicked.

281
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:53,480
 If my Nest cam notified me that somebody was taking packages off my front porch, that would

282
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,640
 instigate a feeling of anger.

283
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,760
 It would give me observations that influenced the feelings I had.

284
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,480
 You catch that?

285
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,640
 So it is with your behavior as well.

286
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,880
 The behaviors that you demonstrate in life will have an impact upon the people who see

287
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
 them.

288
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:19,240
 You will instigate a feeling within your romantic interests, depending upon how you speak and

289
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,840
 how you act.

290
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,000
 So what do your behaviors say about you?

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
 Do you tear people down with your words?

292
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,400
 Do you lash out in anger and get defensive when things aren't going your way?

293
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,680
 Do you have a short fuse that doesn't take much to set you off?

294
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,240
 Proverbs 25, 28 would say, "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and

295
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
 left without walls."

296
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
 Nobody wants to be in a relationship like that, where there is no safety, there is no

297
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,760
 security, where one partner in the dynamic is angry or unpredictable to the point that

298
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,160
 the walls of our relationship could come crashing down at any given moment.

299
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,040
 Do you tell half-truths to get out of trouble?

300
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,200
 Transparency builds trust, but dishonesty breeds division.

301
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,480
 Proverbs 12, 19 says, "Truthful lips endure forever."

302
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,600
 Do you want your relationship to endure forever?

303
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 Did you need truthful lips?

304
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,280
 You need to speak the truth.

305
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
 But a lying tongue is but for a moment.

306
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,560
 You see, truth and honesty, they are vital for long-term relationships.

307
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,560
 But if you can't tell the full truth on something that's small right now, how are they going

308
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,880
 to be able to trust that you will tell the full truth on something big that happens tomorrow?

309
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
 Do you flirt frequently?

310
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,040
 Like are you emotionally entangling someone else, getting their hopes up with absolutely

311
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,080
 no expectation of doing anything with that romantic interest?

312
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,840
 That's not kind, that's confusing.

313
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,480
 First Corinthians 14, 33 says, "For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace."

314
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,280
 So listen to me, if you're deep-liking stuff on their social media, or you're DMing them

315
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,400
 on Instagram, or you're commenting on their posts, or you're sending them pictures, or

316
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,360
 you're texting them frequently, or you're dressing a certain way to garner their attention,

317
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,800
 whatever it is, that's not kind.

318
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,200
 If you don't actually have romantic interest, do not do it.

319
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:30,520
 You're getting someone's hopes up only to drop them in such a hopeless fashion.

320
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 What about your actions?

321
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,920
 Like do you say one thing but do another?

322
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
 Like it's going to be really hard to be reliable in a relationship then.

323
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,720
 James 1, 22 says, "But be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves."

324
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,640
 Like we want to date people that say what they mean and mean what they say, right?

325
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
 That's what you want.

326
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 You want someone that is going to give you their word and then follow through.

327
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,800
 Like they're not all intention and no action because that's not healthy.

328
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,440
 Do you choose the hard right over the easy wrong?

329
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,440
 Like are you willing to forego something that you really want for yourself that you can

330
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,920
 take care of that thing that they really need you to do?

331
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,520
 Proverbs 3, 27 says, "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it's in

332
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
 your power to do it."

333
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,680
 You see, the way someone behaves says a lot about their romantic viability because the

334
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,560
 way someone behaves says a lot about their character.

335
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,720
 And that's what Paul's getting at.

336
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
 He wants us to consider what it means to be people of character.

337
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,800
 And what you need to know about character is that character isn't presented in a moment,

338
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,280
 it's proven over time.

339
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,040
 Character is not presented in a moment, it is proven over time.

340
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,680
 Anyone can turn it on for the first date.

341
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 Some of you know it.

342
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,800
 We went on that first date and he was amazing.

343
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,880
 And then we went out the second time and oh my gosh, he was a completely different person.

344
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,320
 I don't know what happened there.

345
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,680
 Anyone can play the part when they meet your parents.

346
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,020
 Like anyone can make a really good first impression on your friends because they know that matters

347
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,760
 a lot and they need to get their approval so they can get yours too.

348
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:10,440
 Anybody can look good in the initial interaction but it takes someone of character to have

349
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,800
 a long standing reputation that's worthy of writing home about.

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,600
 Anybody can be full of charisma but what you're looking for, not only in someone else but

351
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
 particularly in yourself, is character.

352
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
 That's what you want.

353
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,360
 Think about it like this.

354
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,640
 When you apply for a job, why does the employer ask you for character references?

355
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,040
 Why do they ask you for character references?

356
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,920
 Because you may go into the interview and have an amazing conversation with them and

357
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,400
 your employer may grasp some fraction of your character but they cannot get a full comprehensive

358
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
 grasp of your character in that interview.

359
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 Why?

360
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:57,600
 Because it takes time to understand how truly right and worthy of repute is someone.

361
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,360
 And so they ask, "Hey, give me references.

362
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,440
 Tell me the names and phone numbers of people that can speak to the way you speak, that

363
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,000
 can inform me of how you listen.

364
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,520
 Like tell me of some people that can actually attest to your behavior.

365
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,920
 I need to know of people that can speak with greater credibility as to your character.

366
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,840
 Give me working character references."

367
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
 Just to bring it into our context, what would your dating references have to say about your

368
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,720
 character?

369
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,520
 What would your dating references have to say about your character?

370
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,360
 Just imagine whether it's a romantic interest you have or it's a current boyfriend or girlfriend

371
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,560
 sitting here with you tonight, what if they could call up everyone in your dating history?

372
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,440
 What would they learn?

373
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,120
 Would they see a report that marks you with genuine godliness, the way that we're describing

374
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,720
 that, "Man, this is someone that has conducted themselves with high character."

375
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,120
 Or would they see someone that just knows how to play the part?

376
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
 And I know that that can feel really indicting.

377
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,760
 That can feel really convicting.

378
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,400
 What you also need to know is that we don't date people with regard to who they once were.

379
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,600
 We date people with regard to who they now are in Christ Jesus.

380
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,200
 And so you're here tonight and if you feel, "Man, I've done some things.

381
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,240
 I've been some places.

382
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,360
 I've seen some things.

383
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
 I'm filled with regret."

384
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,640
 Take hope, brother, sister.

385
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
 God does not regard you what you've done.

386
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
 He's paid for that in full.

387
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,560
 He regards you with who you are right now.

388
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,480
 And we should date people with a similar type of heart.

389
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:42,840
 But it's important for us to consider if you want to bring your best self to a dating relationship,

390
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,560
 what's your behavior got to say about you?

391
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,520
 Be a student of your behavior.

392
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
 Like watch yourself like you're watching game tape.

393
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,880
 I remember when I played football, my coach was a drill sergeant when it came to tape.

394
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,400
 Like he would fast forward and rewind and fast forward and rewind every missed assignment

395
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
 I had.

396
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,340
 It was painfully unbearable to endure.

397
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,080
 And yet the reason he would do it for me isn't because he hated me.

398
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
 He would do it for me because he wanted to make me better.

399
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,720
 But not just that, he wanted to make all of us better.

400
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,920
 When you consider your behaviors, you're not just trying to be a better version of yourself.

401
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,760
 You're trying to be a better version for them as well.

402
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,880
 That's what you're trying to aim towards.

403
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,280
 And here's the thing that's crazy.

404
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,520
 What does it look like to date people in such a way where when they come into your orbit

405
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,560
 and they interact with you, you leave them better than you found them?

406
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,240
 There's all this awkwardness and tension around breaking up.

407
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,920
 Man, there's no awkwardness and tension in breaking up.

408
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,880
 If that person whom you're breaking up with can actually look at you and say like, man,

409
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,600
 I'm so grateful.

410
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,440
 Even though this is hard, even though I'm sad, I'm grateful that my life intersected

411
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,260
 with yours because I'm a better person today than I was at the beginning.

412
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,280
 How amazing would it be if their future spouse, husband, wife could look back upon you and

413
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,840
 say I'm grateful they dated you.

414
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
 They're better because of you than they would have been without.

415
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,280
 Let our behavior be marked with that kind of character, a character that leaves people

416
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 better than we found them.

417
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,040
 The second way we've got to evaluate our relational readiness is we have to examine our beliefs.

418
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
 You've got to examine your beliefs.

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,260
 As Paul is writing to Timothy, who's taking charge of the church at Ephesus, he wants

420
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,480
 to be clear that a godly example should be marked by love and faith, which makes total

421
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,880
 sense in the life of a believer.

422
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
 But it begs the question, what does it have to do with dating?

423
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,960
 Well, let's just take these ideas, love and faith, one at a time.

424
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,280
 If you study Paul's writings, love is always directed towards the benefit of another person.

425
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,800
 It's not expressed in serving ourselves.

426
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,320
 It's always expressed in serving someone else.

427
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,480
 First Corinthians 13, it says this, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels

428
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,040
 but have not love, I'm a noisy gong.

429
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,920
 I'm a clanging cymbal.

430
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,400
 If I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and knowledge and if I have

431
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,800
 all faith so as to remove mountains that have not love, I'm nothing.

432
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,360
 If I give away all I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned but I have not love,

433
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
 I gain nothing."

434
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,800
 For Paul, love is so significant that the most captivating and brilliant and generous

435
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:34,720
 person in all the world is rendered useless without the proper motivation.

436
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 What's the proper motivation?

437
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
 Love.

438
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,640
 I mean, just think about it like this.

439
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,680
 Who wouldn't sign up for some of what Paul is talking about?

440
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,880
 Just looking at the verse, "Speaking of tongues of men and angels," yeah, please, I'll take

441
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 some of that.

442
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 "Prophetic powers to understand all mysteries and knowledge."

443
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,960
 I mean, if you're offering, Paul, sure.

444
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
 How about faith to move mountains?

445
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
 Yeah, that could help us a little bit around here.

446
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,680
 I'm in for all of this and yet Paul is adamant in the point that as awesome as it all is,

447
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,760
 it is meaningless if it's not marked by love.

448
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
 What kind of love?

449
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,460
 The kind of love he talks about is the kind of love that's characteristic of God.

450
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,960
 It should be an unconditional love, a love that is so binding in its force that it could

451
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,600
 hold a perfect God to an imperfect people.

452
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:30,240
 Man, if that kind of love can bind that kind of incompatibility, then that's the kind of

453
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,800
 love I need for whatever relationship I'm trying to create here on earth.

454
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
 I need the love of God.

455
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
 If it could hold him fast to me, it will hold me fast to someone else.

456
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,600
 But here's the thing.

457
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,680
 We often rely so frequently upon things that are much smaller than this to bind us together.

458
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
 He's cute.

459
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
 She's nice.

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
 I love their family.

461
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,000
 We have a great time together.

462
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,600
 We rely on small flimsy things instead of things that are of strength and substance

463
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,800
 like the love of God.

464
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 And I'm not saying that that's bad.

465
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,040
 I hope she is nice.

466
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,440
 I hope he is cute.

467
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,400
 I hope your relationship is marked by some of these nice-to-haves, but the need-to-have

468
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,940
 is the love of God.

469
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,520
 Because here's the thing.

470
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,920
 Appearance is a powerful binding force until you begin to age.

471
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,440
 Like success and money and wealth and power, that is a powerful binding force for a relationship

472
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,640
 until you lose your job.

473
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
 Fun?

474
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,560
 Yeah, that's a powerful binding force for two people to one another that is until hard

475
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,120
 times fall upon one or the other.

476
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:46,640
 But the love of God, that is the most powerful binding force of all.

477
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,920
 Like that's the force that never gives, it never fails, it never wavers in any way whatsoever.

478
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,240
 And that's the kind of force that you need to bind you to one another.

479
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,840
 That's why Paul says this to the church in Corinth.

480
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,260
 He says in 2 Corinthians 6, "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership

481
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,840
 has righteousness with lawlessness?

482
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
 Or what fellowship has a light with darkness?

483
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,060
 What accord has Christ with Belial?

484
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,320
 Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?"

485
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,040
 You see, God's design is one that wants us to link up with somebody that values the same

486
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,880
 things in life and has the same vision as they move forward through life.

487
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
 And this is a non-negotiable.

488
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,360
 Like I talk to people down front that are believers and they're dating non-believers

489
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,920
 and there's strain and stress already in the relationship.

490
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,800
 Why is that the case?

491
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,120
 Because even though you're bound by some kind of force, there's an enduring, indomitable

492
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,940
 force in the life of the believer that's not there for the non-believer.

493
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,520
 Because the reality is they love God and you don't.

494
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,920
 You know, like there's this incompatibility that's ultimately, though it may work today,

495
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,840
 is ultimately going to divide in the future.

496
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,880
 You want to be linked up, equally yoked along somebody that can run so parallel straight

497
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:14,520
 with you that there's never divide on the basis of the most important things in life.

498
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,040
 And so if you're a believer, date believers.

499
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,200
 And to be frank, this isn't just a non-negotiable for believers.

500
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,480
 This is a non-negotiable for non-believers too.

501
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,340
 If you're here in the room, why would you want to be bound in relationship to someone

502
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,240
 that's going to be dragging you to church, to a building that you don't care the teachings

503
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
 of?

504
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
 Why do you want to be linked up to someone that's going to be guilting you into moral

505
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,160
 conformity to a set of beliefs that you just don't hold?

506
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,200
 That sounds tough, you know?

507
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,480
 Now let me be very clear.

508
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,120
 Believers and those that don't believe should be deep, great friends with each other.

509
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:59,480
 The Bible is littered with that type of relationship where we're bound to each other in friendship.

510
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,960
 And yet I am saying it's better to be alone with God than lonely with a spouse.

511
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
 So why faith?

512
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,540
 If that's why love matters, why does faith matter?

513
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,240
 Because the Christian life is not just theoretical, it's practical.

514
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,880
 It's one thing to say you trust God when things are really good.

515
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,760
 It's another thing to say that you trust God when things are really bad.

516
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,320
 It's easy to show up here on Tuesday nights and worship alongside all of your friends,

517
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,440
 but it's another thing to wake up Wednesday morning and worship him all by yourself.

518
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,400
 Anybody can walk like a Christian, but not everybody can walk like Christ.

519
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,580
 Does that make sense?

520
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,540
 You should have a faith that looks like Christ's.

521
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,280
 What does Christ's faith towards us look like?

522
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,940
 It's one that is, he has a love that is deeply convictional for you.

523
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
 It's not just conceptual.

524
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,380
 It's not just like, "Oh, I know them.

525
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,380
 I love them."

526
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,020
 No, it's convictional enough to the point that I would die for them.

527
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:06,820
 Like I would be willing to let all of my raw emotion for them become like urgent action

528
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,100
 for their sake.

529
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,260
 And we should have the same faith should compel us to act in a way that conforms with the

530
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,160
 love we have for God for the sake of the one whom we love.

531
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,920
 If he was willing to lay down his life for the sake of those he loved, then bound by

532
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,140
 our own belief, we should do so likewise.

533
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,520
 That's the kind of relationship we want to be a part of.

534
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,420
 And the last thing to consider if you're evaluating your romantic readiness is you need to inspect

535
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,200
 your boundaries.

536
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 You need to inspect your boundaries.

537
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,920
 Because according to Paul, we can't set an example worth following without purity.

538
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,760
 If you've been around the church for any amount of time, the popular narrative around the

539
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,240
 topic of sex and hookup culture is that it's extremely prevalent within the young adult

540
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,840
 generation of America, which isn't shocking.

541
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,200
 Like we live in a world where eight of the 10 top songs on the 100 Billboard chart are

542
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,600
 filled with romantic language and sexual deviancy.

543
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,560
 It's not surprising that people can make the leap that this is what we're interested in.

544
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,840
 And yet what's interesting is if you study the sexual trends of the last five to 10 years

545
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,080
 amongst our generation, that perception would be wrong.

546
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,200
 Gene Twenge, psychology professor at San Diego State University, and one of the foremost

547
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,040
 experts on young adults has reported that people in their 20s are two and a half times

548
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,720
 more likely to be abstinent than their parents were at their age.

549
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,840
 Now I know that doesn't represent the entire room here, but it is one startling data set

550
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,960
 in a bigger conclusion that many researchers are claiming about today, which is they have

551
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:47,020
 ascribed this title as true of your generation, that there is a sex recession.

552
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,280
 So why the emphasis on purity then, Paul?

553
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,320
 Like if it's never been better, why do we need to worry about it?

554
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,240
 It sounds like we're doing good.

555
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,040
 Our parents should take a lesson out of our playbook, you know?

556
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,280
 Why then are we talking about it?

557
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,480
 Because although there is perceivably less casual sex, there is just as much committed

558
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 sex today as there has been in times past.

559
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,060
 According to Pew Research, 72%, so three out of four young adults, believe sex is acceptable

560
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,520
 in a committed relationship.

561
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,360
 Meaning that although young adults are less inclined to hook up with a stranger, they

562
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,320
 are equally, if not more inclined to hook up with somebody that they are in a longstanding

563
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,640
 and committed relationship with.

564
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,480
 For a different example, if you survey porn usage since 2020, research shows dramatic

565
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,440
 increases in overall consumption.

566
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,080
 I'll spare you more statistic, but here's the bottom line.

567
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,360
 The sex recession is not a lust recession.

568
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
 It's not.

569
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:59,720
 Like we may not be hooking up or casually engaging with strangers in a sexual way, but

570
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,480
 the reality of the matter is people are having just as much sex today as they were then.

571
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,480
 It's just in a different context.

572
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,760
 People are finding ways to indulge their sexual appetites as they always have.

573
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,000
 And a dating relationship in this modern day is one of the leading places that people search

574
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 for it.

575
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,800
 Because a dating relationship is a place of commitment.

576
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,520
 And that's where people want to find, that's where they want to satisfy their sexual appetite.

577
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
 Now am I saying sex is bad?

578
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
 No.

579
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,840
 Sex is amazing.

580
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,240
 God created it.

581
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,800
 It's wildly powerful.

582
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,120
 So powerful in fact that it's the means through which he has decided to populate the earth.

583
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:47,080
 Like when you engage in a loving, covenantal sexual union with a person, you have the ability

584
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,960
 to create life.

585
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
 That image is God.

586
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
 Do you see that?

587
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,680
 How amazing that is?

588
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,600
 That God which creates something from nothing has given you the ability to do the exact

589
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 same thing?

590
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,440
 It's an amazing thing.

591
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,800
 And yet what we need to know is while it is amazing, it is so very dangerous.

592
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,400
 It's so very dangerous outside the confines of marriage.

593
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,960
 Proverbs 6.32 says, "He who commits adultery lacks sense.

594
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,080
 He who does it destroys himself."

595
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,200
 First Corinthians 6.18 says, "Flee from sexual immorality.

596
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,440
 Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person

597
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,880
 sins against his or her own body."

598
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
 Sexual compromise outside of God's design is dangerous.

599
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,360
 Also because you practice how you play.

600
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,760
 If you're willing to make compromises sexually this side of marriage, won't you be willing

601
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:50,360
 to make compromises sexually on the other side of marriage?

602
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:58,760
 Like a pattern of adultery today is just preparation for adultery tomorrow.

603
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,280
 And nobody wants to be in a relationship with someone like that.

604
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,240
 Now again, this is not an indictment upon you for the decisions you've made.

605
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,560
 This is just a call to a better way.

606
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,520
 But this is just an opportunity to look and say, "Hey, you go be like Aladdin in the cave

607
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,560
 of wonders, in a sea of tempting jewels ripe for the taking.

608
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,280
 You take only the lamp.

609
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:31,160
 You sweep in and you grab that which is most desiring of your focus, which is purity."

610
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
 Which is purity.

611
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,800
 That's where life and love and joy and deep fulfillment is found.

612
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
 So how do we do that?

613
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,120
 Paul says in Romans, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh

614
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,560
 to gratify its desires."

615
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,480
 Which just means don't invite unnecessary temptation into your life.

616
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
 Why would you do that?

617
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,840
 Why would you invite unnecessary temptation into your life?

618
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,280
 There's already plenty of temptation out there that is outside of your control.

619
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,960
 So don't invite it unnecessarily.

620
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,800
 Start building parameters today instead of provisions for the flesh.

621
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,320
 Stop doom scrolling on Instagram.

622
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,800
 Stop looking at your Explorer page, especially if you've not set limits upon the algorithm

623
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,360
 that determines what populates in that space.

624
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,160
 Have someone tonight block the person you've been sexting with.

625
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
 Don't do it anymore.

626
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,200
 Don't leave here this evening without actually taking that step.

627
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,440
 Find some accountability.

628
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,000
 Let people know where you go and where you're tempted.

629
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,240
 Set boundaries early.

630
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,680
 Honor them always and revisit them frequently.

631
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,080
 I'll say that again, man.

632
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
 Set boundaries early.

633
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,040
 Honor them always and revisit them frequently because you will find areas within your defense

634
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,880
 where there is some gap that needs filling.

635
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
 You be vigilant.

636
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,240
 You keep fighting the good fight for Christ has fought the good fight for you.

637
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,040
 Now you do the same.

638
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,760
 And listen, this is just for free.

639
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,040
 When you get into a relationship, I love what J.D. Greer once said, some parameters for

640
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
 you to set up.

641
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,240
 If you don't have parameters here tonight and you're in a dating relationship, here

642
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
 are your parameters.

643
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,480
 You should write these down.

644
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,680
 Nothing in the dark, nothing below the chin, nothing horizontal, and nothing lasts longer

645
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,040
 than five seconds.

646
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,720
 You laugh because you know it'll work.

647
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,200
 Nothing in the dark, nothing below the chin, nothing horizontal, and nothing lasts longer

648
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,360
 than five seconds.

649
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,560
 You be self-controlled.

650
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,000
 You be self-controlled.

651
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,240
 That most odd gift of the spirit that lies at the end of the list, have you ever wondered

652
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
 how unique that is?

653
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
 Like the gifts of the spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness.

654
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,440
 Like yeah, these all make sense and then you get to self-control.

655
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,480
 It's like what is going on with that?

656
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,400
 Like that is so outside the realm of the rest of these.

657
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,080
 And it here's why self-control is so meaningful.

658
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:06,600
 It is that, it's that fruit of the spirit which distinctly sets us apart from the rest

659
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,260
 of the created order.

660
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,800
 Like nothing else, no other creature can exercise self-control.

661
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,800
 Like you put a bowl of food out, your dog will come running to it because they're hungry.

662
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:27,720
 But you and I, we can choose to fast an entire day long if we so choose.

663
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,760
 God has given you a sense of agency, a sense of control that you might subdue your flesh.

664
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:43,640
 You might become the master of yourself, that you might look like him.

665
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,560
 Second Timothy 2.22 says, "So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith,

666
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,040
 love and peace along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."

667
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,600
 I love this.

668
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:04,240
 Like Paul is penning his final letter to Timothy and he tells him, he's like, "Hey, yes, flee

669
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
 youthful passions."

670
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
 But it's not just that.

671
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,280
 It's not just a command to pull yourself together.

672
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,160
 Like be strong, Timothy.

673
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
 Wage war.

674
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,600
 Like it's not just a command to fight off sin.

675
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,800
 It's also a call to pursue God.

676
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,360
 The kind of life he's invited you into.

677
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,120
 Like you've not just been set free from sin, you've been set free to new life.

678
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:35,160
 Like Jesus so often is misunderstood as the guy that sweeps in, saves you from your sin

679
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,120
 and lets you go along your merry way.

680
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,600
 And yet that's just not the case.

681
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,840
 He's not just a savior.

682
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,640
 Like he didn't just show up to save you, clean you up and then get you back out there, kid.

683
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,320
 Like that's not his heart.

684
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,320
 The heart of Jesus is one that says, "Yes, I will save you from your sin.

685
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:59,960
 And I will lead you into better life, into life like you've never known, life like you

686
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
 couldn't dare dream."

687
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,800
 Do you want that?

688
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:15,080
 Like what if the worst day of your life was always the day behind you?

689
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,560
 In the best days, we're forever and always forward.

690
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,320
 That is the invitation of the cross.

691
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,720
 He says, "Hey, flee youthful lust and passion.

692
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,360
 Set aside the things of the world and pursue righteousness.

693
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:35,520
 I gave my life to give it to you, to rightly unite you and put you before the Father.

694
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,160
 Like you walk, pursue my righteousness, put feet to your faith, experience my love, enjoy

695
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
 my peace.

696
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,400
 Like this is what I'm affording you."

697
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,960
 And the reason I love this so much is because on a talk like this, which as I was writing

698
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,480
 it, I just felt this trepidation of like, man, it can feel like the pressure of perfection

699
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,360
 can weigh so heavy on an evening like this.

700
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,880
 Like, hey, here's everything you're not doing.

701
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,440
 The reason I love this is it tells us like the goal isn't perfection.

702
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,920
 The goal is pursuit.

703
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,440
 That's it.

704
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,080
 Like the goal is to pursue the one that pursued you, to walk in the way that he walked for

705
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,960
 you, to enjoy the life that he gave for you.

706
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,200
 Like we pursue not perfection, but we pursue the only perfect one who would pursue an imperfect

707
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
 people.

708
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,560
 We pursue the only lovely one that would pursue such an unlovely people.

709
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:44,680
 And we pursue the only worthy one that would pursue an unworthy people.

710
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,000
 You see, Jesus's behavior was perfect when ours was not.

711
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,480
 He lived the life you could not.

712
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,360
 You could not meet the standard that God had set for you.

713
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,440
 And yet he saw you, saw me in our disarray.

714
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,680
 And he said, "I'll live it for you.

715
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,920
 I'll be perfect on your behalf."

716
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,680
 His belief in what God was doing in the world, the kind of redemption he was trying to afford

717
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,320
 us, all the kind of rescue that he had written at the beginning of time was still bringing

718
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,400
 into fruition.

719
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,320
 Jesus believed and prevailed in the face of our disbelief.

720
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:31,140
 And he was pure, purging us from all our impurity, the stain of sin which had grown so deep that

721
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,560
 we thought will never be cleansed.

722
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,720
 He laid down his life.

723
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
 He broke his own body.

724
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,880
 He spilled forth his blood to say, "I will clean it.

725
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,800
 I'll save you.

726
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,400
 You just have to believe in me."

727
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,760
 That's the invitation on the table.

728
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,800
 All you have to do tonight, brother, sister, is place your faith in him and you can be

729
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:59,080
 forgiven.

730
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:07,800
 Before you consider pursuing anyone else, first consider the one who pursued you.

731
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,080
 Before you worry about a standard you should reach, think about the standard you could

732
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,520
 not but the one who could reach it for you.

733
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,640
 Let me pray for us.

734
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,240
 Father, we love you.

735
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,680
 So grateful for this evening, God.

736
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,800
 I know that this can be a heavy topic, that self-evaluation can be really exposing.

737
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,800
 And so, God, I just pray for my friends here.

738
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,400
 There are some here tonight, God, that have been exposed, that have done things, seen

739
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,520
 things, been places, and yet, God, they want to change tonight.

740
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
 They do.

741
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:47,600
 I pray they would know, God, that change is possible with you, that it can happen right

742
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,320
 now if only they would ask you, God.

743
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,920
 Others are here and they feel exposed but they don't feel some sense of conviction.

744
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,080
 They see in themselves and in their relationship, and we're moving towards marriage.

745
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
 That's okay.

746
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,680
 We're playing husband and wife already.

747
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,720
 God gives us a pass, free license to run on all these things the way we wish.

748
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,800
 God, that's just not the case.

749
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,720
 I pray, God, that these friends would know they're cutting the legs out from the joy

750
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
 that you would give them.

751
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,760
 And then, Father, there are some here tonight that realize, man, I'm not ready for a dating

752
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:35,600
 relationship but I am ready for a relationship with the one whom my soul has so eternally

753
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
 longed for.

754
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,680
 I pray, God, that they would place their faith in you and walk with you into the future you

755
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
 have.

756
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
 We love you.

757
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
 It's in Jesus' name we pray.
