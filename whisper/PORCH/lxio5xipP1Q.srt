1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,900
 - How we doing, the Ports, how we doing?

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,300
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,240
 I wanna welcome you.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,620
 If you're a guest with us, welcome home.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,580
 If you're tuning in from Fort Worth or Houston

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,460
 or one of the streaming campuses

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,580
 or you're driving in your car listening

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,560
 somewhere around the country,

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,880
 we're glad you are as we continue this series.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,720
 First comes love.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,440
 If we haven't met, my name is JP or Jonathan Picluda

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
 and it's just a privilege to be here tonight

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,160
 and jump into this series.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,880
 So we're talking about relationships.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,080
 And let me start with this question, okay?

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,740
 Who is the best basketball player on earth?

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,480
 Do you know who the best basketball player on earth is?

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,480
 (audience laughing)

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,960
 Yes, you are correct.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,760
 It is LeBron James, indeed.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,600
 (audience cheering)

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
 Yes, it is.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,560
 Yes, it is.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,920
 Which leads me to my second question for you.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,800
 Do you know who the worst basketball player

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,220
 on the planet earth is?

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,800
 (audience chattering)

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,400
 Yes, indeed, again, you are correct.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,560
 It is me, okay?

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,980
 And so here's the interesting fact.

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,080
 LeBron and I, we're the same size.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,600
 We really are, if we haven't met, find out afterwards.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,420
 I know it's proportioned a little bit different,

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,920
 but we are the same.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
 And so you say, well, how did you become the worst?

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,680
 If you're the same size as LeBron,

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,440
 how did you become the worst basketball player

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
 on the planet earth?

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,400
 Did you never practice?

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,220
 No, I did practice.

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,060
 Did you not play?

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,800
 I actually did play.

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,440
 Here is how I became the worst basketball player

45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
 on the planet earth.

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,320
 It is because I learned the wrong way.

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,160
 So at a very early age, little JP,

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,520
 growing up on a farm in the middle of nowhere,

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,280
 Quero, Texas, South Texas,

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,000
 and I'm just kind of watching the guys on TV

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
 and they're getting these rebounds

52
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,240
 and they jump up and they bring it down here.

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,980
 And so that's what I do.

54
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,340
 And I just practice that.

55
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,740
 And not only that, but I watched the Harlem Globetrotters

56
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,100
 and they're doing these like crazy,

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,060
 like hook shots and fadeaways.

58
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,460
 And so no one ever sat me down

59
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,940
 and showed me the fundamentals.

60
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,380
 I'm just practicing the hook shots all day.

61
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,900
 If it goes in the baskets, it's pure luck,

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,300
 but that's what I do all day long.

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,220
 And so then out there on the farm,

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,860
 got this little hoop, that's what I do all the time.

65
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,880
 And then I get into school and get to this age

66
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,560
 where I can play basketball and I never really have

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
 except by myself or with the neighbor,

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,900
 just doing crazy shots.

69
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,960
 And they're like, okay, why don't you shoot a free throw?

70
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,920
 And I'm like, you know, and they're like,

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,040
 well, why are you doing that?

72
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,440
 And I'm like, well, that's, isn't that what you do?

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
 And I was terrible.

74
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,720
 And I was so bad because I practiced poorly.

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,600
 See, when you're six, seven,

76
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 and you bring the ball down here from a rebound,

77
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,940
 it's just like saying to the opponent,

78
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,660
 here you go, you can have the ball.

79
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,360
 And you're not using your height to your advantage.

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,920
 I remember the coach saying,

81
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,740
 (speaking in foreign language)

82
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,880
 'cause he couldn't say my last name.

83
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
 He said, (speaking in foreign language)

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,480
 I don't mean a hill of beans.

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,000
 And I don't even know what that means,

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,100
 but I just know he was angry at me

87
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,880
 because I kept giving the opponent the basketball.

88
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,400
 And the reason I say that is because I believe today

89
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,920
 we are in a relationship crisis.

90
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,200
 And I believe the reason we're in a relationship crisis

91
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,940
 is because we're practicing poorly.

92
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,480
 We are practicing poorly.

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
 Lean in here because you've gotta give me this.

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,700
 As we consider the end goal of marriage

95
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,240
 to becoming one flesh and running together for a lifetime,

96
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,160
 our generation, millennials,

97
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,400
 or whatever you wanna call yourself,

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,920
 we're not getting better at this.

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
 We're getting married later,

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,660
 and those marriages are ending more often.

101
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,800
 The greatest disasters and tragedy of marriages

102
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
 the world has ever seen.

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,720
 It seems almost like we should go back

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
 to doing something they used to do long ago

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,720
 'cause whatever we're doing today is not working.

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,920
 But you haven't given a lot of thought about that.

107
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,360
 You're just gonna continue the model, the process.

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
 No one here wants to be divorced,

109
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,420
 and yet half of you will be.

110
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,400
 Half of you.

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,360
 Why?

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,440
 Because you're practicing poorly, unbeknownst to you.

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
 And so this evening I want to talk about

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
 poor practices when you're looking for love.

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
 What are the poor practices that I see in young adults

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,960
 when you are looking for love?

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,680
 And we're gonna address those poor practices

118
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,340
 with the scriptures, with God's word.

119
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,700
 And if you do these things,

120
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,420
 you either won't find love at all

121
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,260
 or you won't find love that lasts.

122
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,880
 And we're not only just practicing poorly, friends.

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,460
 What's happening is it's the foundation.

124
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,200
 We're learning from the wrong people.

125
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 Our experts are the ones who are most terrible at this.

126
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
 The ones that we watch in awe of,

127
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,040
 oh, isn't what they have so beautiful?

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,960
 And then we begin to take instruction,

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,980
 that we begin to date like they do

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,320
 to the same end result that they have.

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,440
 Let me just kinda explain what I mean by this.

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,700
 I watch HGTV.

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,980
 And there's this couple on HGTV.

134
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,660
 About a year ago I'm watching and I'm like,

135
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,080
 man, this couple's got it going on.

136
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,260
 It's not Chip and Jojo, that's not who I'm talking about.

137
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,960
 It's this other couple and they're flipping houses

138
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,700
 and I'm like, what a dream, you know?

139
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,440
 She's cute and he's attractive

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,580
 and they get to work together

141
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,740
 and they're making all this money and driving escalades

142
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,580
 and they get to like flip houses for a living

143
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,240
 and they're just living the dream

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
 and they're laughing and giggling

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,360
 and I'm like, oh man, and I'm tempted to think

146
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,860
 in my foolishness, like I want that.

147
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,440
 Like maybe Monica and I should just kinda leave

148
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,680
 this whole ministry thing and just start flipping houses,

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,640
 you know, 'cause I want what Tarek and Christina have.

150
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,320
 You know, cute couple.

151
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,740
 But then fast forward, divorced.

152
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,180
 But it's not just them, right?

153
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,020
 It's not just them.

154
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,880
 There's Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert.

155
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
 I know.

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,800
 I know, I know, right?

157
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,360
 He's singing God Gave Me You and Honey Bee.

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,200
 Miranda's his honey bee, right?

159
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,160
 And if country music can't hold two together, right?

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
 Divorced.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,040
 And not just them, right?

162
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,920
 Then there's Brad Pitt and who do I wanna say next?

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,100
 I got options, but we'll go Angelina.

164
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,000
 Bradgelina, you know?

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,040
 I mean, Mr. and Mrs. Smith voted most beautiful people.

166
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,920
 I mean, they're just out there making great movies.

167
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,760
 Divorced.

168
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,240
 Having kids, adopting kids, no longer together.

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,960
 They're teaching us how to date

170
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
 and what it looks like to love.

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
 And you got Bennifer, we got Ben Affleck

172
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,680
 and Jennifer Garner just making it happen

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,800
 in the movie scenes.

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,140
 Beautiful people, we're watching along like,

175
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,600
 oh, look what they have, gone, over, done.

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,000
 And I'm telling you, like you think, man, it's funny.

177
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,280
 You don't think these are the people telling you

178
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,800
 how to date, giving you relationship instruction.

179
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,160
 Got Russell Brand and Katy Perry, right?

180
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,880
 Just, you know, fun and a little bit crazy, right?

181
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,480
 He's her dark horse.

182
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,760
 Broke up with her in a text message, now hear her roar.

183
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,480
 It's not, it's not going well.

184
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,440
 And I could go, I got a list here in front of me.

185
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,720
 We could go Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore,

186
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,560
 Gwen Stefani, Gavin Rosdale.

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
 We could go Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise,

188
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
 just a little crazy.

189
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,840
 We go Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon,

190
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,560
 Anna Faris and Chris Pratt, Ryan Reynolds and Scarlet,

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,280
 I know, I know, guys, I'm sorry.

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,600
 I'm sorry, I'm the messenger.

193
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,220
 Ryan Reynolds and Scarlet Johansson.

194
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,500
 Of the 21 seasons of The Bachelor.

195
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,580
 (congregation laughing)

196
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,660
 19 heartbreaks, guys.

197
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,220
 These are the ones that are saying,

198
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,180
 hey, sit down and date like I do.

199
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,020
 And guys, here's the not funny part.

200
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,740
 We're doing it.

201
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,460
 We're learning from the wrong instructors

202
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,180
 and we're practicing poorly.

203
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:38,340
 And we're gonna be left with the same result,

204
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,100
 the same heartbreak, the same ending.

205
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,340
 We have a bad example, we practice poorly,

206
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,620
 then we can't play the game.

207
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,180
 And so I wanna give you five ways

208
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,260
 I see young adults practice poorly.

209
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
 If you do these five things,

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,320
 if you wanna stay single or marry poorly,

211
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,020
 and here's the first one.

212
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,740
 Number one, you hide hurts and habits.

213
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,100
 Hide your hurts and your habits.

214
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,740
 You are practicing poorly

215
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,660
 if you are hiding your hurts and your habits.

216
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,340
 And so let me take you back 13 years ago.

217
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,580
 I married the beautiful, now Monica Pucluta,

218
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,660
 and we're going on the honeymoon to Playa del Carmen.

219
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,620
 And we didn't know what to take to Mexico for seven days.

220
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,820
 And so we took six suitcases,

221
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,140
 lots of luggage, lots of baggage.

222
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,180
 We take them there to the DFW Airport.

223
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,000
 And remember those long escalators,

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,740
 really long escalators, like just go forever.

225
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,900
 And I've got, like she's got one,

226
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,820
 and I've got five 'cause I'm like showing off,

227
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,420
 peacocking as the new husband, you know.

228
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,560
 And I'm like, I got this.

229
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,460
 And we get on that escalator,

230
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,940
 and we get to the top,

231
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,460
 and one of those suitcases grabs the side of the escalator,

232
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,860
 the part that's not moving,

233
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,140
 and he kinda jolts me forward.

234
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,020
 I hit her.

235
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,540
 We tumble down, true story, head over heels

236
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,260
 from the top of the escalator

237
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,060
 to the bottom of the escalator.

238
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,980
 I'm laying there.

239
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,700
 Like I can't get up, I'm bleeding.

240
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,460
 There's blood, okay?

241
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,500
 'Cause I was like trying to keep her safe,

242
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,060
 and now I'm bleeding, yeah, oh.

243
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,620
 And I'm bleeding.

244
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,120
 There's blood.

245
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,460
 And here's the deal.

246
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,580
 All that baggage you're hiding,

247
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,340
 you're gonna take on the honeymoon.

248
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,820
 And it's gonna hurt.

249
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,260
 And it's gonna hurt in the marriage.

250
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,100
 And so what kind of baggage am I talking about?

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,300
 I'm talking about hurts, guys.

252
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,920
 You know right now.

253
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,260
 Are you carrying with you right now a hurt?

254
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,340
 And are you dealing with that hurt

255
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,460
 by getting in another relationship?

256
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,740
 You know somebody broke your heart.

257
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,500
 You look back, you think about him all the time.

258
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 You think about all these, you stalked her on the internet.

259
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,840
 And you know you're messed up.

260
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,220
 And you're just trying to move through life.

261
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,340
 You know that thing,

262
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,660
 and I don't mean to be so flippant about this at all.

263
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,060
 Guys, listen, I love you.

264
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,700
 I am so for you.

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,740
 And I just want you to deal with your hurt.

266
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,400
 And if you think that thing that your uncle did,

267
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,100
 or that guy did, or that time you drank too much,

268
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,620
 and you said no, but he just kept pushing.

269
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,940
 You think that that's not gonna mess with you,

270
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,540
 that you're just gonna be able to suppress that,

271
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,460
 put that up in a closet,

272
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,500
 lock it up and not have to deal with it.

273
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,920
 You are sadly mistaken.

274
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,060
 You think that you can,

275
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,100
 maybe it's something that,

276
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,340
 maybe it's not something you did,

277
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,700
 but something that,

278
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,920
 maybe not something that happened to you,

279
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,380
 but something that you were a part of,

280
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,020
 like an abortion, whether you're male or female.

281
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,060
 You know on that birthday every year,

282
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,420
 you think back,

283
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,780
 and you know the hurt that you've suppressed,

284
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,820
 it's still there.

285
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,060
 And the only way you're going to be able to move forward

286
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,540
 and find a healthy marriage is if right now, today,

287
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,920
 in this season, you deal with it.

288
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,720
 You deal with it.

289
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,960
 And it's not just the hurts.

290
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,200
 It's the habits.

291
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,780
 It blows my mind,

292
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,880
 and I shouldn't because I was the same way,

293
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,500
 but it blows my mind that some of you think

294
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,100
 that marriage is going to solve your habit.

295
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
 I've had guys look me in the eyes and say,

296
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,540
 "Yeah, I'll struggle with masturbation.

297
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,220
 "I'll probably struggle with masturbation until I'm married."

298
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,500
 Friends, you're gonna struggle more when you're married.

299
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,380
 And you're like, "No, I'm not.

300
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,580
 "I'm gonna be having sex all the time."

301
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,660
 No, you're not.

302
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,300
 (congregation laughing)

303
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,740
 No, you're not.

304
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,000
 See, last week,

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,120
 no, that's not the way that it works.

306
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
 And what you've done is you've taught yourself a shortcut,

307
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 and it's not interchangeable.

308
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,400
 You don't just take that shortcut that you've taught yourself

309
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
 and plug in sex and it all transfers.

310
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,900
 It doesn't work that way.

311
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,800
 It's never worked that way for nobody.

312
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,360
 It's not gonna work that way for you.

313
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,580
 You don't believe me right now.

314
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,420
 You think, "No, no, I will.

315
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,820
 "No, it won't.

316
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
 "Man, I'm gonna struggle with porn until I'm married."

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,540
 No, you're gonna struggle with porn more when you're married.

318
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,440
 That's what's gonna happen.

319
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,680
 You're gonna be married to porn.

320
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,000
 You're gonna be married and a porn addict.

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 That's what's gonna happen.

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
 This is my story.

323
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,560
 You're not gonna be the exception.

324
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,520
 You're not gonna be the first dude to walk down the aisle,

325
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,600
 the first girl, 'cause I know what your problem to.

326
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
 You walk down the aisle, you say, "I do,"

327
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,840
 and all of a sudden, "Oh, yeah, that addiction

328
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,320
 "that I fed for the past 16 years, now I'm free from it."

329
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,980
 No, you're not.

330
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,560
 That's not the way it works.

331
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
 So what do you do?

332
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,280
 You get well.

333
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,060
 You show up here 6.30 p.m. Monday night.

334
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,840
 You stop coming to the porch if you need to.

335
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
 You start showing a regen instead.

336
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
 Stop coming here.

337
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
 If you're listening, you find a Celebrate Recovery

338
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
 or Recovery Ministry or Regeneration in your city,

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,420
 and you go there.

340
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,040
 Maybe it's shelter from the storm.

341
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
 Some of you, you're like, "I've heard it.

342
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
 "I've thought about it."

343
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,200
 Hey, hey, hey, stop thinking about it.

344
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,360
 Stop thinking about it.

345
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,180
 Now's your time.

346
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,020
 That's why you're here.

347
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,560
 It's why God, in his mercy, is speaking these words

348
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,840
 right now, or at least allowing you

349
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,340
 to hear these words right now.

350
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,660
 So that you'd act on them.

351
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,580
 You deal with your habits.

352
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:07,500
 Some of you, you drink when you're stressed.

353
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,260
 You know what comes with marriage?

354
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,140
 Stress.

355
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,340
 You're gonna drink more.

356
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,660
 You deal with that right now.

357
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,380
 Second Peter two, verse 19 says,

358
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,540
 "People are slaves to whatever has mastered them."

359
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,060
 If you're a slave, start with, "God, I'm a slave.

360
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,500
 "I'm a slave, I can't stop."

361
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,780
 How do you know if you're a slave?

362
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,460
 Listen, look backwards.

363
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,620
 In the past month, have you looked at porn?

364
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,020
 Have you masturbated in the past month?

365
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,760
 Have you been drunk in the past month?

366
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,380
 In the past 30 days, is that where you've been?

367
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,460
 If so, start with, "I've got a problem.

368
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,320
 "I need help.

369
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,860
 "I've gotta deal with this baggage."

370
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,680
 In regards to hurts, it may be forgiving someone.

371
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,160
 You're like, "Man, you don't know how I've been hurt."

372
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,280
 I've hurt, you're not gonna surprise me.

373
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,360
 And I'm telling you, God calls you to forgive people.

374
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,760
 First John one, verse five says, "God is light.

375
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,600
 "In the God that we worship, there's no darkness at all.

376
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,360
 "If we claim to have fellowship with him

377
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,560
 "and yet walk in darkness, we lie

378
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
 "and we do not live out the truth.

379
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
 "But if we walk in the light,

380
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
 "if we're known as he is in the light,

381
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,280
 "we have fellowship with one another

382
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,880
 "and the blood of his son, Jesus,

383
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
 "purifies us from all sin."

384
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 What am I asking you to do?

385
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,760
 That hurt and that habit that you're hiding,

386
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 to bring it to the light, to tell someone tonight

387
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,840
 and say, "Hey, I need help."

388
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,680
 Will you hold me accountable to taking the next step

389
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,600
 in forgiving or recovering or getting help?

390
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
 Will you help me?

391
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,680
 Because I've been too afraid.

392
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,760
 I've been hiding this.

393
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,160
 I've been thinking I can deal with it on my own

394
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,000
 or I don't have to deal with it at all.

395
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,280
 Don't hide hurts and habits.

396
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,640
 Heal from hurts and deal with habits.

397
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,600
 Write that down.

398
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,040
 Don't hide hurts and habits.

399
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,480
 Heal from hurts and deal with habits.

400
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,640
 The next thing you do if you wanna practice poorly

401
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,120
 is you stay selfish.

402
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,160
 Number two, stay selfish.

403
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,320
 You are practicing poorly if you are doing things

404
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,000
 that allow you to stay selfish.

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
 Are you right now feeding selfishness?

406
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
 You gotta think about this one.

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,760
 How do we feed selfishness?

408
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,080
 We live alone.

409
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
 That's one way is like, man, I just want the freedom

410
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
 to do whatever I wanna do.

411
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,280
 When I wanna do it, I'm gonna store up money

412
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,360
 so that I can go somewhere.

413
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,640
 When I wanna go there, I wanna buy what I wanna buy,

414
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,760
 eat what I wanna eat.

415
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,020
 You feed your preferences.

416
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,320
 I've said it before.

417
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,920
 Preferences can rob you of paradise.

418
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,240
 When you start feeding your preferences, which is common,

419
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
 everyone's teaching you to do so,

420
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
 you are feeding selfishness

421
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
 and there's no room for selfishness in marriage.

422
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,400
 And you say, well, what can I do?

423
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,160
 One thing you can do is you can get a roommate.

424
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
 You can get a really dysfunctional roommate.

425
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,440
 That will prepare you for marriage, okay?

426
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,680
 Get a roommate that leaves their clothes everywhere,

427
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,280
 all over the floor, and doesn't do the dishes.

428
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,960
 Some of you are like leaning over to your roommate

429
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
 and say, you're welcome right now, okay?

430
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
 (congregation laughing)

431
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
 Do that.

432
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,140
 That's the kind of roommate Monica has.

433
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,040
 You'll figure it out in a minute.

434
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,800
 And so I don't wanna lose you,

435
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 'cause I said get a dysfunctional roommate.

436
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,480
 You think, oh, he doesn't mean that.

437
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,520
 No, no, I really do.

438
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,280
 I mean, you're gonna have a dysfunctional roommate

439
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,160
 for the rest of your life

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,680
 'cause you're gonna have a human roommate.

441
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
 If you wanna get married, if you get married,

442
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
 you're gonna find yourself with another human being

443
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,580
 and they're gonna be different than you

444
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,480
 and that's gonna create dysfunction.

445
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
 And so it's a beautiful thing

446
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,920
 when you can learn to resolve conflict right now,

447
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,720
 when you don't just kinda go your separate ways.

448
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,480
 You sit in the living room and you work through it.

449
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
 You look each other in the eyes

450
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
 and you work through it in a biblical way.

451
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,220
 That honors God and it's training you.

452
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,600
 It's training you for future relationships.

453
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,960
 We even date selfish.

454
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,400
 Like I hear this, I'll ask people,

455
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 what do you love about him?

456
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,300
 Well, I love the way he makes me feel.

457
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,480
 It's a selfish response.

458
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,400
 What about when you don't feel that anymore?

459
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
 Are you still gonna love him?

460
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,160
 What about when he doesn't make you feel that way anymore?

461
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,680
 And so then what we do is we jump into something

462
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,120
 because of the way it makes us feel

463
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,200
 and then we jump out of it when we don't feel it anymore

464
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
 and then we jump into something else

465
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,680
 because of the way it makes us feel

466
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,480
 and then we jump out of it when we don't feel it anymore.

467
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,240
 Is that training for marriage or training for divorce?

468
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,880
 It's training for divorce.

469
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,320
 You've gone to a university for divorce.

470
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,380
 Like if you look backwards

471
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,080
 and you see lots of relationships, okay,

472
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,160
 then you gotta start with,

473
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,880
 man, I've got a really bad track record.

474
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,840
 I can't choose 'em.

475
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
 Everyone I've chosen has ended.

476
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,600
 And so what am I waiting for?

477
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,800
 And I've talked to people and it's like you're waiting,

478
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,280
 it's almost like you think marriage is like the flu.

479
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,360
 Like I'm just gonna catch it.

480
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,520
 Like it's gonna happen to me.

481
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
 Like I'm gonna be somewhere

482
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,720
 and love's just gonna come upon me.

483
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,880
 And it's not that way.

484
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,280
 It's something that you intentionally seek out

485
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,440
 as a follower of Christ.

486
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,540
 As you seek out Christ,

487
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,600
 you seek out the things that Christ creates in his people.

488
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,460
 As you look within his people.

489
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,880
 And so how do you do that?

490
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,020
 You serve.

491
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,460
 How do you kill selfishness?

492
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
 You serve.

493
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,060
 So you're listening right now, you're hearing my words,

494
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
 and here's a simple question.

495
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,980
 Are you serving?

496
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,460
 Are you serving in the church?

497
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,500
 Is there a part of your week that's designated

498
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,220
 you going somewhere that you don't have to be

499
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,660
 except for you willfully, willingly,

500
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,820
 you are there donating your time,

501
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,660
 giving of yourself,

502
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,940
 pointing out this is tremendous training for marriage.

503
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,740
 That you are the most,

504
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,380
 you are the engine of the church,

505
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,100
 the most powerful force that the world has ever seen.

506
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,500
 Young adults, you are the engine.

507
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
 How are you doing?

508
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,720
 Are you the first one there,

509
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,380
 willing to set out chairs,

510
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,620
 willing to stay late,

511
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,700
 willing to lead,

512
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,840
 willing to find gaps

513
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,340
 and not just point them out like a critic,

514
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,580
 but stand in them?

515
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,000
 You're serving.

516
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,640
 You know, I don't know if you are.

517
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
 Some of you, you are.

518
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,800
 Some of you, we get to serve here together.

519
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,480
 But if you're not, friend,

520
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,520
 because I love you, I urge you

521
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,400
 to serve, serve within the body.

522
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
 Don't stay selfish.

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,340
 Serve selflessly.

524
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,740
 The scripture says in Ephesians 5,

525
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,200
 21, "Submit to one another."

526
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,040
 It's talking about marriage.

527
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
 "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ

528
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,000
 "as wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands

529
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,240
 "as you do to the Lord."

530
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,400
 And then to this, it says to the husbands,

531
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
 verse 25, "Love your wives just as Christ loved the church

532
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,240
 "and gave himself up for her."

533
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,040
 It says in verse 28, "In the same way,

534
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,580
 "husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.

535
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,640
 "He who loves his wife loves himself."

536
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,480
 This is such a high calling

537
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,080
 that you would love some woman like Christ,

538
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,840
 loved the church and bled out for her,

539
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,080
 gave his life for her, set aside his own desires

540
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 for the betterment and the salvation of the church.

541
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,920
 This is crazy.

542
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,720
 If you did this, the world would change.

543
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,120
 And it starts with just small steps of selflessness.

544
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 There's no room for selfishness in marriage.

545
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,560
 Let me tell you how this verse applies to me.

546
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,240
 Love your wife as you love your own body.

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,160
 Man, I get in bed, like right now in this fall,

548
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,800
 like cold last night.

549
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
 Love it.

550
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,460
 Get under those covers.

551
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,520
 We got like this foam mattress,

552
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,720
 like this Tempur-Pedic thing.

553
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
 It's like a knockoff Tempur-Pedic.

554
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,680
 It's amazing.

555
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,320
 And I get all snugly under there.

556
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,680
 I like it cold, you know, and all comfortable

557
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,760
 and just like right about to catch those Zs, you know?

558
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,680
 And then Monica, my amazing wife,

559
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 says, "Babe, are you sleeping?"

560
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,800
 (congregation laughing)

561
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,360
 I wanna be like, you know, crickets, you know, like,

562
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,400
 but no, babe.

563
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
 What's up?

564
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,600
 I'm cold.

565
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,920
 (congregation laughing)

566
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,320
 That's interesting.

567
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
 (congregation laughing)

568
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,720
 No, no, you don't say that's interesting.

569
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,840
 You get your hiney up and you get to that thermostat

570
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,960
 and you change that thermostat

571
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,360
 because you know what I do when I'm cold?

572
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,480
 I change the thermostat.

573
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
 And so if she's cold and I'm gonna love her

574
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,280
 like I love my own body,

575
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,800
 I'm gonna be finally aware,

576
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,520
 acutely aware of what her desires and her needs are

577
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,040
 in any moments that I can meet them

578
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,580
 and put my own aside for her.

579
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,080
 That's where you say, oh.

580
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,800
 Blake Shelton and Miranda,

581
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,760
 he didn't do that.

582
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,520
 Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.

583
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,360
 Write that down.

584
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,240
 Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.

585
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 It's amazing time to serve within the church right now.

586
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,680
 Number three, the things that we're doing

587
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,560
 as we practice poorly,

588
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,600
 we're looking for love in all the wrong places.

589
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,160
 Are you right now, look,

590
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,840
 do you look for love in the wrong places?

591
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,160
 You are practicing poorly

592
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,480
 if you are looking in the wrong places

593
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,220
 because what you find in the wrong places

594
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,320
 are the wrong people.

595
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,360
 And you get stuck in the wrong relationship.

596
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 Some of you, you've done this.

597
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,040
 You're thinking back right now and you're like,

598
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,320
 oh yeah, I met him there

599
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,440
 and yeah, that didn't work out so well.

600
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,220
 I hate when people tell me so often,

601
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,560
 they're like, man, I just don't know where to meet someone.

602
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,920
 Man, JP, it's so hard.

603
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,440
 Like, where do you go?

604
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
 And so then they just resolve,

605
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,420
 they're like, man, I'm just gonna go to the bars

606
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,600
 and the clubs, you know,

607
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,020
 because I hope that there's a good person there.

608
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,880
 And I'm just like, man, the amazing wives

609
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,080
 and the amazing husbands don't hang out

610
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,920
 at the clubs and the bars.

611
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,580
 Like, you're stacking the odds against you

612
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,680
 and you're thinking, no, no, no,

613
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,740
 they might because I'm there and I'm a good person.

614
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,600
 Maybe not, but let's just say,

615
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,540
 let's just give you the benefit of the doubt

616
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,440
 and say you are, okay?

617
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,360
 So maybe, maybe out of the 2,700 people there at the club,

618
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,560
 you know, five clubs in one,

619
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,160
 wherever you're at or standing at the bar,

620
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,000
 maybe you find the one who's there

621
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,460
 doing some sort of bartender evangelism,

622
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,120
 like they just got some kind of ministry that they started

623
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
 that they're going bar to bar

624
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
 and just sharing the gospel, you know?

625
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,360
 They're like, hey, I'll take a, you know,

626
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,360
 a virgin margarita and by the way,

627
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,080
 did you know Jesus was born of a virgin?

628
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,660
 And they're just sharing the gospel

629
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,080
 and you're gonna find them

630
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
 and they're gonna be your husband or your wife

631
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
 and it's gonna be beautiful

632
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,080
 and you guys are gonna tell your story, but probably not.

633
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,320
 Probably not.

634
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,440
 Probably what you're gonna find in the bars and the club

635
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,980
 are selfish people, narcissistic people who are shopping

636
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,140
 out of desperation, hoping to find someone

637
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,380
 that's had one too many drinks

638
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,660
 that they might be able to convince

639
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,100
 to spend some time with them.

640
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,480
 And I just would urge you,

641
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,420
 I'd urge you to look among God's people.

642
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,340
 You have the benefit of that

643
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,500
 just because of where you are right now

644
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,160
 and I'm not saying everyone here are God's people,

645
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,920
 but you know, 2 Corinthians 6, 14,

646
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,800
 do not be unequally yoked to unbelievers.

647
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,000
 We've made that abundantly clear,

648
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,900
 but you don't want just somebody who's like,

649
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,080
 check the box Christian.

650
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,680
 You want someone who is radically running hard after Jesus,

651
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,080
 like their entire life is focused

652
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
 on the trajectory of Jesus.

653
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,040
 They're all in the radical,

654
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,820
 they're thinking about, hey, where are we going?

655
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,420
 They're serving in the ways that I said

656
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,720
 and they're going on international trips

657
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,620
 and they're caring for the widows and the orphans

658
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,480
 and their money is God's

659
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,320
 and everything they have is God's

660
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,600
 and they're just all in.

661
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,520
 And if you want to find that person

662
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,440
 and have lots of babies and make disciples,

663
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,740
 that's just the scripture, guys.

664
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,500
 That's what he says.

665
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,440
 That's God's plan.

666
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,400
 That's the first great commission

667
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,840
 that God's people would find each other

668
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,340
 and be fruitful and multiply.

669
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,120
 Proverbs 13, verse 20 says,

670
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,640
 "Walk with the wise and become wise,

671
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,080
 "for a companion of fools suffers harm."

672
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,640
 In the clubs and the bars,

673
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,120
 you're stacking the odds against you.

674
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,600
 Why do we do this?

675
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,900
 Because you watch the movies

676
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,360
 and that's where they meet each other.

677
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,240
 Would you please stop taking relationship advice

678
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,380
 from the Kardashians?

679
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,760
 It's not gonna go well for you.

680
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,820
 It's gonna go as it has for them.

681
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,440
 First Corinthians 15, 33 says,

682
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,300
 "Do not be misled, bad company corrupts good character."

683
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,280
 And so if you hang out with the right people

684
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,320
 in the right places, can you hear this?

685
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,840
 That's half the battle.

686
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,600
 Like that makes it so much easier.

687
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,760
 If you just did that one thing tonight,

688
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
 you just started hanging out in the right places

689
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,920
 with the right people,

690
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,680
 you've at least increased your odds

691
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,560
 of bumping into the right person.

692
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,920
 It actually does two things.

693
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,040
 One, it allows you to consistently

694
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,920
 be around good prospects.

695
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,160
 You're looking to marry someone

696
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
 completely sold out for Jesus.

697
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,040
 And so you're hanging out with people

698
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,560
 who are completely sold out for Jesus.

699
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,600
 That helps you.

700
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,080
 The other thing that it does,

701
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,640
 is it allows the church to get to know you,

702
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,760
 to protect you, to care for you,

703
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,140
 and then to point out prospects to you.

704
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,360
 That's why we are so, not why,

705
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,600
 but one of the reasons we hammer this idea of community

706
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,640
 that every single person here

707
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,120
 would on a weekly basis meet with a small group of people

708
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
 that you are going through the scriptures with

709
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,640
 and holding each other accountable.

710
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,840
 We call that community that you would have a small group.

711
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,760
 Listen, your church is not 2,700 people,

712
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,000
 4,700 people, 5,000 people, or even 100 people.

713
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,520
 Your church should be about six to 10 people

714
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,540
 who will help you make rent when you need to,

715
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,420
 who will care for you when you've lost your job,

716
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,600
 who will bear burdens with you

717
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,040
 and celebrate victories with you.

718
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,220
 And they'll say, "Hey man, he's no good for you.

719
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,040
 "Hey, she seems awesome."

720
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,840
 And they'll help you when your heart starts going crazy

721
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,200
 and you can't think straight.

722
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
 They'll help you think straight.

723
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,640
 And what they do, in Psalm 1:4,

724
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,600
 it says their friends and their family

725
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 looked upon their loved

726
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,740
 and praised it more than the party.

727
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,420
 They look at two people and they're like,

728
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,620
 man, that just makes sense.

729
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,220
 This weekend in that chapel,

730
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,600
 a couple days ago I did a wedding.

731
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,700
 It was an arranged marriage.

732
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
 You guys know what that means, arranged marriage?

733
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,820
 Yeah, I did an arranged marriage.

734
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,700
 Probably not what you're thinking though.

735
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,340
 This is how it was arranged.

736
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,480
 She lived in Dallas, he lived in Fort Worth.

737
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,980
 Some guys just kept saying the same thing,

738
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,260
 man, y'all need to meet each other.

739
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,580
 They're both in the church, both plugged in,

740
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,960
 both members, both serving,

741
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,520
 both under the authority of the elders.

742
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,920
 And people kept bumping into him like,

743
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,200
 hey man, y'all should, have you met Morgan?

744
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,800
 Hey Morgan, have you met Andy?

745
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,200
 And then another girl, hey listen,

746
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
 have you met Morgan, have you met Andy?

747
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,080
 And then another girl to Andy,

748
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 have you met my friend in Dallas, Morgan?

749
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,320
 Man, y'all just, I think 'cause you both serve,

750
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,560
 I think y'all belong together.

751
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,160
 And then he's on an international trip in Ethiopia

752
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,400
 and two girls come up to him and he's like,

753
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,560
 okay, Andy, we got the perfect girl.

754
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,160
 You're not gonna believe, so her name is Morgan.

755
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,180
 And he's like, oh gosh, God, I get it.

756
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,480
 You know, I hear ya, loud and clear.

757
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,920
 Fine, and comes to Dallas, hey, I'm Andy, will you marry me?

758
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,600
 No, it didn't work that way, but it almost did.

759
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,040
 It almost did.

760
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,600
 And there we are, and you know what it was?

761
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
 It was a this just makes sense wedding.

762
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,020
 And that's the only weddings I do.

763
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,000
 You want me to marry you?

764
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,660
 Like the only weddings I do are this just makes sense.

765
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,000
 Like man, you guys, y'all, yeah, I can see this.

766
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,240
 It's an arranged marriage.

767
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,860
 That God used the body to bring those two together.

768
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,960
 Some of you need to hear right now,

769
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,020
 change your playmates in your playground.

770
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,180
 Don't look in the wrong places.

771
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,840
 Look only among God's people.

772
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,220
 Write that down.

773
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,620
 Don't look in the wrong places.

774
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,420
 Look only among God's people.

775
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,080
 The fourth way, you practice poorly,

776
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,620
 you set shallow standards.

777
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,320
 You are practicing poorly if you've set shallow standards.

778
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,160
 What do I mean by shallow standards?

779
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,800
 I mean, I've heard it all.

780
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,940
 I love dogs, like he's gotta love dogs.

781
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,600
 Like let me tell you something,

782
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,140
 you are gonna marry someone who hates dogs.

783
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,880
 That's just the way it works, okay?

784
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,660
 That is what's going to happen.

785
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,800
 All right, and I've heard it, man, she's gotta be blonde.

786
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,760
 I've heard he's gotta be tall.

787
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,520
 You know, whatever those silly standards are,

788
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,880
 he's gotta love the walking dead or whatever,

789
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,040
 I don't know where you're at.

790
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,920
 Like we come up with these crazy things, okay?

791
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,200
 I like, man, I love this story.

792
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,640
 There was this couple, well, they weren't a couple,

793
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,560
 there were two individuals, a male and a female,

794
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,680
 serving here at the porch,

795
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,280
 and her and her community group, they made a list.

796
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,640
 And so they made a list of deal breakers.

797
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
 And so she wrote down some deal breakers,

798
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,300
 I'll show it to you.

799
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,600
 This is the non-negotiables, these are deal breakers.

800
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,200
 Her first one on there is tattoos, okay?

801
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
 If he has tattoos, that's a deal breaker.

802
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
 The number two is if he's not a believer, okay?

803
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
 I'm just gonna go ahead and give you some free advice,

804
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,720
 that's a bad order.

805
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,320
 Heavy drinker, quick temper, controlling,

806
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,080
 these are all deal breakers if he has tattoos.

807
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,460
 Let me show you her husband here, they're married now, okay?

808
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,640
 [congregation laughing]

809
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,380
 That's my boy Kenny, that's not a shirt, okay?

810
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:57,480
 Brother's tatted up, and God's just laughing, okay?

811
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,680
 God's like, hey, and so some of you are like,

812
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,680
 okay, it's only this race, no kids, I can't have kids.

813
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,800
 Listen, you're like, really, that's not good?

814
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,640
 I can't do that?

815
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,160
 Here's what I tell you, care about what God cares about.

816
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,720
 I mean, have standards rooted in Scripture.

817
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,440
 Have your standards rooted in Scripture.

818
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
 Remember when I said preference robs you of paradise?

819
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,560
 Have your standards rooted in Scripture.

820
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
 Let me give you a good Scripture.

821
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,800
 I taught on this, it's actually the number one

822
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,840
 listen to podcast on the porch.live

823
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,280
 called Identifying the One, and it was this text.

824
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,080
 It says, it's the text, don't let anyone look down on you

825
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,400
 because you're young, it's 1 Timothy 4:12.

826
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,600
 It says this, but find someone, I'm saying,

827
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,940
 but find someone who sets an example for believers

828
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,680
 in the way they talk, in the way they act,

829
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,600
 in the way they love, in their faith, and in their purity.

830
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,520
 You want a good list straight from the Scriptures?

831
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,680
 Here's some non-negotiables.

832
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,000
 I wanna find someone, I wanna inspect the way they talk,

833
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,320
 I wanna watch the way they act,

834
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
 I wanna watch the way they love others,

835
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,560
 I wanna observe their faith, and I wanna know their purity.

836
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,760
 That's a fantastic list straight from the Scripture.

837
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,480
 So set standards that are rooted in Scripture on the who,

838
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,840
 but not just the who, how about the how?

839
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,920
 You can right now, what can you do right now?

840
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,760
 You can make a list from the Scriptures

841
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
 on who you want to marry, and also how you want to date.

842
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,280
 And so like, what do you mean by that, right?

843
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,560
 You can date intentionally for marriage.

844
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,760
 We don't date for fun, we don't date for pleasure.

845
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,500
 A date is an interview.

846
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,880
 It's you trying to find someone

847
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,440
 that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with.

848
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,600
 You're interviewing them.

849
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
 We don't play games, right?

850
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,640
 Games are fake.

851
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,120
 You don't hang up on somebody

852
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,560
 to see if they'll call you back,

853
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,520
 or not respond to their text

854
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,200
 just to make them wait a little bit.

855
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,560
 Romans 12, nine says, "Love must be sincere."

856
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,040
 Games create fake relationships, that's what they do.

857
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,440
 You can just be sincere.

858
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,640
 You can say what you mean.

859
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,280
 You can talk about where this is going.

860
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,120
 You can be intentional.

861
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,180
 And then you date with absolute purity.

862
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,320
 Talked about that last week.

863
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,840
 First Corinthians six, verse 18 through 20 says,

864
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,120
 "Flee from sexual immorality.

865
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,340
 "All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

866
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,400
 "but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body."

867
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,380
 It says this, listen, "Do you not know that your body

868
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,540
 "is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

869
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,940
 "whom you've received from God?

870
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,920
 "You are not your own.

871
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,680
 "You've been bought by a price.

872
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,180
 "Therefore, honor God with your body."

873
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,160
 Okay, what does this mean?

874
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,860
 Anybody follow the Harvey Weinstein thing?

875
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,280
 The producer in Hollywood accused of sexual assault

876
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,440
 and rape and, did you guys catch this?

877
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,300
 It's interesting if you didn't, you know,

878
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,400
 watch the news every now and then.

879
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,240
 (congregation laughing)

880
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,600
 Ben Affleck, Ben Affleck spoke up and he just said,

881
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,060
 "Hey, that's appalling, you know, what he did.

882
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,020
 "That's crazy."

883
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,660
 And then what happened is someone said,

884
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,560
 "Hey, Ben, I just wanna remind you,

885
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,320
 "do you remember when you groped Hillary

886
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,540
 "on Total Request Live?

887
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,440
 "You grabbed her breast, you remember that?"

888
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,400
 And then Hillary comes back and says,

889
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
 "Hey, I remember that.

890
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,900
 "I was a child, right?

891
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,880
 "Hillary Burton."

892
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,160
 And now Ben Affleck's caught all this bad rep

893
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,220
 because he grabbed this girl's breast.

894
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,040
 And let me ask you a question.

895
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,360
 What's wrong with that?

896
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,900
 Why is that not okay that he did that?

897
00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,100
 I hope what you're thinking is because it's not his body.

898
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,560
 That doesn't belong to him.

899
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
 He can't just do what he wants to with it.

900
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,760
 It's not his.

901
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,240
 And here's my newsflash for you.

902
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,760
 It's not hers either.

903
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,440
 It's God.

904
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,080
 Do you not know that your bodies are temples

905
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,400
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

906
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,600
 whom you've received from God?

907
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,840
 You are not your own.

908
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,000
 You are not your own.

909
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,160
 You are not your own.

910
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,540
 You've been bought by a price.

911
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,760
 That price was Christ.

912
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,460
 It was Jesus's blood.

913
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,320
 Therefore, honor God with that body.

914
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,600
 It's his body.

915
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,280
 So you think, "Well, I can do whatever I want to with it

916
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
 "because it's mine."

917
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
 No, it's not.

918
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,320
 You got it on loan.

919
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,340
 And so before you put your hand up her shirt,

920
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,760
 why don't you ask for permission from her father?

921
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,960
 That's a game changer.

922
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,600
 Before you get all handsy, right?

923
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,040
 Before you lay down on the couch,

924
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,960
 you're watching a movie,

925
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,280
 before you go there, a little makeout session,

926
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,480
 "Hey, God, are you okay with this?"

927
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
 Man, before we go there,

928
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,000
 let's just spend a little bit of time in the scripture.

929
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,080
 Make sure it's a buzzkill.

930
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,440
 (congregation laughing)

931
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,120
 Don't have shallow standards.

932
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,360
 Have standards that are rooted in scripture.

933
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,480
 On the who and the how, write it down.

934
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
 Don't have shallow standards.

935
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
 Have standards rooted in scripture.

936
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,960
 Number five, you wanna practice poorly,

937
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,140
 you passively pursue Christ.

938
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,180
 You are practicing poorly

939
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,100
 if you are passively pursuing Jesus.

940
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:47,860
 Some of you, man, you gotta self-identify right now

941
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,260
 'cause this one's important.

942
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,460
 I'm not saying you gotta raise your hand.

943
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,340
 I'm just saying in your mind,

944
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,500
 you gotta say, "Okay, that's where I'm at."

945
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,580
 Some of you, you look at Jesus like he's a hobby.

946
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,220
 Like your whole week comes and goes

947
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,220
 and Tuesday comes, you're like, "Oh yeah, the porch.

948
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,380
 "Man, yeah, let me go give me some Jesus."

949
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,100
 He's like your walking buddy, me and Jesus.

950
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,060
 And you live your whole life

951
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
 and you just kinda add Jesus to it.

952
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,760
 It was never meant to be that way.

953
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,700
 You are not walking buddies with Jesus.

954
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,300
 You are running hard after Christ.

955
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,700
 Friends, if you're like, "Man, I don't know how to do this.

956
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,300
 "Do I wanna be hot or cold or lukewarm?"

957
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
 Listen, you go all in.

958
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,940
 Listen, if you hear me, I want you to be radical, sold out.

959
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,800
 If you need, you're like, "Well, how do I do that?

960
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,100
 "I don't wanna sell everything I have."

961
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,020
 Sell everything you have if that's what it means for you.

962
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,980
 You move, you're like, "Well, I'm gonna move

963
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,820
 "to a hut in Africa."

964
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,300
 Sure, man, if he calls you to get on a plane.

965
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,020
 Okay, I'm not kidding.

966
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,620
 Like you go all in.

967
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,140
 So what, you want me to share the gospel

968
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,060
 with everybody I work with?

969
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,860
 Everybody, every single person you work with.

970
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,380
 Tell them all about Jesus.

971
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,580
 You're not gonna get up there

972
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,300
 and God's gonna be like, "Man, I'm just disappointed

973
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,660
 "'cause you were just a little too zealous.

974
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,260
 "You told one too many people about me."

975
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,940
 That's not gonna happen.

976
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,260
 You go all in.

977
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,420
 There's nothing that you will give up down here,

978
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,140
 nothing you will sacrifice for his name

979
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,700
 that you will regret, not one thing.

980
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,500
 You go 100%.

981
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,660
 And some of you, you've not bought into the faith

982
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,260
 of Ben and Jennifer or Brad and Angelina.

983
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,940
 You bought into the faith of American Christianity

984
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,700
 and you are completely okay having lukewarm Christianity

985
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,460
 and it is not okay.

986
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,700
 It's not Christianity.

987
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,580
 It's not Christianity of any kind.

988
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,180
 He says you're neither hot nor cold,

989
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,780
 so I spit you out of my mouth.

990
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,500
 And I'm not fear mongering right now.

991
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,420
 I'm not trying to scare you into the faith that won't work.

992
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,060
 I'm trying to get you to examine your life

993
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,900
 just to say, you know what, self-identify in your mind.

994
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,260
 Am I all in with Jesus?

995
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,300
 Did I wake up thinking about what he gave for me

996
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,500
 on the cross?

997
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,620
 Or am I beat down by my sin?

998
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,300
 Or am I lost in the world?

999
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,380
 Or is marriage such an idol for me

1000
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,260
 that Christ is in the backseat?

1001
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,820
 He says, Hebrews chapter 12, verses one and two,

1002
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,460
 therefore, since we are surrounded

1003
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,200
 by such a great cloud of witnesses,

1004
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,820
 the heroes of the faith, those who've gone before us,

1005
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,660
 other brothers and sisters who love Jesus,

1006
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,480
 let us throw off everything that hinders us.

1007
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,860
 Let us deal with our hurts and our habits that hinder us

1008
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,220
 and the sin that so easily entangles us

1009
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,500
 and let us run with perseverance.

1010
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,140
 The race marks out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus,

1011
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,180
 not just the beginner of our faith,

1012
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,340
 the pioneer of our faith or the starter of our faith,

1013
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,100
 but the perfecter and the finisher of our faith.

1014
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,060
 The one who says it is finished,

1015
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,420
 the one who gave his life for us.

1016
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,580
 Let us run hard after him.

1017
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,900
 And what happens, right?

1018
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,280
 This is what you do is you live your life and you run.

1019
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,220
 You wake up and you run and you're running a race

1020
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,300
 and you're serving.

1021
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,380
 And somebody says, hey, the church needs this.

1022
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,580
 You say, I got it.

1023
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,220
 And all of your resources are his and you're running.

1024
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,140
 And we're gonna go to Haiti, I'm in.

1025
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,780
 We're gonna go to Ethiopia, I'm in.

1026
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
 Hey, we need people to serve over here, I'm in.

1027
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,380
 And you're running and you're at the porch on Tuesdays

1028
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,900
 and reaching on Mondays and church on Sundays.

1029
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,260
 And you're just running the race.

1030
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,860
 And as you get down the track, you look beside you

1031
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,740
 and you start to see the same people.

1032
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,080
 Oh, we were in Ethiopia together.

1033
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,100
 We were in Haiti together.

1034
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
 Oh yeah, last Tuesday, we were playing broomball.

1035
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,100
 Oh, you did that porch thing.

1036
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,500
 Oh yeah, I was serving there too.

1037
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,620
 Oh, I see you again.

1038
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,980
 And you just start seeing the same people

1039
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,860
 and you look back and you say, hey,

1040
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,520
 you wanna run forever with me?

1041
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,000
 And they say yes.

1042
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,340
 And that's what it looks like.

1043
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,540
 Hey, you just wanna keep, we've been running towards Christ.

1044
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,820
 You wanna keep going?

1045
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,020
 You wanna just keep going?

1046
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
 They're like, we can keep going.

1047
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,180
 Yeah, let's keep going.

1048
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,100
 You keep going.

1049
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:11,980
 And so you throw off everything that entangles you,

1050
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,560
 the hurts and habits.

1051
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,540
 You serve and you kill selfishness.

1052
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,180
 You run with Jesus' people, the great witnesses.

1053
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,980
 And you commit to only looking for a partner

1054
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,540
 who is running hard after him.

1055
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,020
 The point of this message

1056
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,100
 is that if you're here and you're waiting to get married,

1057
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,900
 you don't have to wait.

1058
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,460
 You're not just waiting.

1059
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,740
 Hear me clearly.

1060
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,780
 Every single thing that I said tonight,

1061
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,060
 you can begin to do today.

1062
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,180
 It's preparing.

1063
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,940
 It's not just waiting.

1064
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,180
 It's preparing.

1065
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,120
 And it's a really tough message to give

1066
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,620
 because some of you are gonna take this

1067
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,260
 and try to create a formula and say,

1068
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,380
 well, if I do these five things,

1069
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,540
 then God has to give me this.

1070
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,740
 It doesn't work that way.

1071
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,140
 You may do these five things,

1072
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,100
 walk outside and get hit by a meteor.

1073
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,000
 That may happen.

1074
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,500
 I'm just saying, man, I don't know what he has for you.

1075
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
 I have no idea.

1076
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,260
 Man, that gets me more emails than just about anything.

1077
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,940
 You're telling me, God, if I have a desire for marriage

1078
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,220
 that it's not promised to me?

1079
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,980
 There's nothing promised to you except for God himself.

1080
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,780
 Can I tell you something?

1081
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,620
 Some of you are disappointed by that.

1082
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,380
 It's just 'cause you don't understand.

1083
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,040
 And others of you, and particularly you gentlemen,

1084
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,120
 you need to hear, stop being passive.

1085
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,460
 You need to go through this list and you say,

1086
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,300
 man, am I good?

1087
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,280
 Like if I've dealt with my hurts and my habits

1088
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,580
 and I'm serving and I'm in the church

1089
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,540
 and I'm killing selfish,

1090
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,820
 I mean, you need to turn to someone

1091
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,280
 to your right or your left and say,

1092
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,520
 will you spend the rest of your life with me?

1093
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,460
 Or start with coffee?

1094
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,960
 I mean, whatever works for you, you know?

1095
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,100
 But you need to move, you need to act.

1096
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,180
 And one of my fears in saying that

1097
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,580
 is some of you unhealthy men,

1098
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,380
 you're gonna hear that and take that as permission to act.

1099
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,140
 And I hope you get to a place where you're like,

1100
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,340
 man, I'm gonna get well.

1101
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,820
 But if you're here, man,

1102
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,140
 and you're running hard after Christ

1103
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,220
 and you're doing these things and you wanna be married,

1104
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,220
 start by finding a godly woman

1105
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,200
 and asking her to spend time with you.

1106
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,320
 (congregation murmuring)

1107
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:34,380
 All of those celebrities, you know,

1108
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,260
 I mean, you could look at what they have in common.

1109
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,540
 They had their greatest passion in common,

1110
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,800
 be it music or acting or whatever,

1111
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,180
 but it wasn't enough.

1112
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,900
 I mean, they had incredible chemistry and shared interests,

1113
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,300
 but it wasn't, they're beautiful.

1114
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,960
 I mean, we could go down the list.

1115
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,040
 They're all very attractive.

1116
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,120
 It wasn't enough.

1117
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,200
 There's gotta be something more to hold you with someone.

1118
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,680
 I've done about 30 weddings, okay,

1119
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,640
 about 30 weddings in ministry.

1120
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,880
 And of those 30 weddings, I've done about 15,

1121
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,080
 Monica and I have done about 15 of the two-on-two counseling

1122
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,720
 and everyone we sit in our living room

1123
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,760
 and we counsel before the wedding,

1124
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,960
 you know, we meet with them several times

1125
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,520
 and they take a test.

1126
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,880
 It's called the prepare test.

1127
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,920
 It's to prepare you.

1128
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,040
 And in that test, we can see, you know,

1129
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,720
 where they need to prepare, you know,

1130
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
 and we can ask them good questions around that.

1131
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,260
 And it seems like of the 15 people we've met with,

1132
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,460
 they've all missed the same questions.

1133
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,960
 And it's all around these rose-colored glasses

1134
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,480
 and the expectations of marriage.

1135
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,960
 And it's just gonna be so different

1136
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,800
 than what they think.

1137
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,720
 Every single one of them, to a couple,

1138
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,120
 has missed the same questions, some of the same questions.

1139
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,980
 And I just reflected on that today

1140
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,640
 and I thought about those 15 to 30 couples

1141
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,180
 and I thought about what they've been through

1142
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,620
 since I've done that wedding.

1143
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,340
 Some of them have been laid off.

1144
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,020
 One of them moved, the couple moved to another city,

1145
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,300
 bought a house, and the first week they were there,

1146
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,420
 they lost their job.

1147
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,860
 They got, some of them struggled with infertility.

1148
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,320
 They thought they'd get married and then have kids

1149
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,160
 and then they couldn't.

1150
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,600
 One of them had, got pregnant, carried the child

1151
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,100
 to full term and lost the baby.

1152
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,520
 Another one lost a child at 16 weeks.

1153
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,480
 They struggled with miscarriages.

1154
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,400
 Some of them have gotten cancer.

1155
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,000
 I was on the phone with one of them today.

1156
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,740
 His wife had a double mastectomy.

1157
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,320
 That was about a week after her mother passed away,

1158
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,080
 dealing with cancer.

1159
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,520
 You don't know what the future holds.

1160
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,280
 And so when I talk in terms of practicing poorly

1161
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,040
 and preparing, it's not just for marriage, it's for life.

1162
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,840
 I have no idea if God has marriage for you or not,

1163
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,800
 but I do know that today you can begin to prepare

1164
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,380
 for whatever he has for you tomorrow.

1165
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,120
 So don't hide hurts and habits,

1166
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,160
 heal from hurts and deal with habits.

1167
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,720
 Don't stay selfish, serve selflessly.

1168
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,640
 Don't look in the wrong places, only look among God's people

1169
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,000
 and don't have shallow standards,

1170
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,440
 have standards rooted in scripture.

1171
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,200
 Don't passively pursue Christ, passionately pursue Christ.

1172
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,960
 I think we all just, at the end of the day,

1173
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,100
 we wanna be chosen.

1174
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,760
 Think back to me in basketball.

1175
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,360
 Like I can remember just standing there, the lineup

1176
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,360
 and it's like I'll take him, I'll take him,

1177
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,520
 I'll take him, I'll take him,

1178
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,800
 until I'm there all by myself.

1179
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,600
 And it's extra embarrassing when you're like

1180
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,480
 the tallest guy there by a foot.

1181
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,880
 They're like, nobody wants the tall guy?

1182
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,440
 I think that's our fear, right?

1183
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,360
 And like we wanna be, like we want someone to say,

1184
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,960
 man, I know you, like everything about you,

1185
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,920
 the way you giggle and the weird way you fold the towels

1186
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,280
 and I love it, it's so cute.

1187
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,720
 The thing you do with your nose

1188
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,200
 and the way you comb your hair and it's amazing.

1189
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,000
 Everything about you and we just say,

1190
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,440
 of all the people in the world, I choose you.

1191
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,460
 Before you leave here tonight,

1192
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,340
 I want you to know God did that.

1193
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:31,960
 He took you pornographers and legalists,

1194
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,100
 adulterers, struggle with masturbation,

1195
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,140
 alcoholics, drug users, self-righteous.

1196
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:52,940
 He takes you and he cleans you up, cost him his life,

1197
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,420
 cost him everything, man.

1198
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,860
 This is really humbling to think he, God,

1199
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,260
 has to take you and wash you, bathe you in his blood.

1200
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,220
 He cleans you up and he purchases you.

1201
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,540
 It's as though he grabs you by the face and he says,

1202
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,580
 you're mine, you belong to me

1203
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,460
 and I'm gonna spend forever with you, forever with you.

1204
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,140
 In the next 70 years, I don't know what you get

1205
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,780
 to experience but I know that if you've trusted in Christ

1206
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,400
 his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins,

1207
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,200
 you get to spend forever with God.

1208
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,420
 Friends, when did that stop being enough?

1209
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,040
 (congregation murmuring)

1210
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,040
 When did it start having to be that and something else?

1211
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,060
 Telling you, in a thousand years,

1212
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,620
 a million years, a billion years,

1213
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,020
 that's all that's gonna matter, that God chose you.

1214
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,180
 Father, I just wanna thank you.

1215
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,560
 I pray that that truth, would you help, please,

1216
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,500
 that truth hit our hearts in a new way.

1217
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,020
 Help us to believe it.

1218
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:13,560
 Father, thank you for sending your son, Jesus,

1219
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:21,060
 purchasing ourselves to you,

1220
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:28,120
 promising us forever with you and your kingdom.

1221
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,440
 God, as we sing now, how amazing you are

1222
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,140
 and how great is your love, would you fix in our hearts

1223
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,420
 that it's enough, that we are yours and you are enough.

1224
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,260
 Would you fix that in our hearts right now, God, please?

1225
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,620
 In the name of your son, Jesus Christ, amen.

1226
00:50:50,620 --> 00:51:00,620
