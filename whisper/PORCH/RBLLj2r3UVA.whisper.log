[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.860]   How are we doing?
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.860]   Slow start.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.560]   How about my friend, Micah Tyler, man?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560]   Micah.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.280]   Thank you for, for leading us.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.840]   Thank you for using your gifts to lead us to God.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840]   Welcome Dallas.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.840]   Welcome Fort Worth.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.400]   We have friends joining us tonight from all over the country as we are hosting a young
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.820]   adult conference here.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.640]   And so if you're a guest with us, we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640]   So glad you can join us.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   Fort Worth.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   Thanks for tuning in.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640]   You guys pay your taxes.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640]   Oh man.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   I saw a couple.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   Oh no.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   Is that?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   Yeah, it's tomorrow.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   Yes.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   Wow.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440]   I'm glad you're here and glad that that announcement was for you.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.680]   The way that we go to the IRS or the way we feel about paying our taxes has so much to
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.040]   do with the way we view the IRS.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.840]   And there's people, even those of you that know you're getting money back, it's like
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.800]   you still are afraid you kind of go in, you're in turbo tax, but I hope I got everything
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   right.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.520]   If you view the IRS as kind of this, this institution that desires to take from you.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.000]   And if you view the IRS as you know, Hey, they're, they're, you know, they're civilized
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   government.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They exist for a reason.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.320]   I just want to do my civil duty.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.880]   Uh, then you, you know, you kind of go at it and you, you understand the routine there,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240]   but I want to tell you the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240]   I think that's true.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'm, I'm weighing those words carefully.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.120]   Uh, certainly.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   The most scary thing that's ever happened to me is I'm driving down the road.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.280]   I'm in my truck.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000]   I've got my two year old Westin.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.720]   He's in the car seat in the back.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   It's just me and him and my phone rings and on the, on the caller ID on my radio, because
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.640]   a Bluetooth working, uh, it's just a five digit number, which I thought was weird.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   It just says like, you know, five, four, three dash two seven.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.740]   And I was like, what is that?
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.680]   And so I, you know, hit on the Bluetooth answer on speakerphone.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   Hello.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.000]   And they say, um, is this Jonathan Pucluta to which I say, yes, it is.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.160]   And they say, uh, great, Mr. Pucluta.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.080]   Um, this is officer McMillan badge number five zero three seven, some number.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440]   And I'm calling you from the internal revenue service.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.240]   I said, okay.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.080]   And he said, uh, sir, I need to ask you a few questions.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.720]   I said, okay.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   He said, sir, are you driving?
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   I said, yes, I am.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   He said, can you pull over?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   I said, yes, I can.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   All right.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   This is got serious.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.920]   I'm like, kind of feel short of breath, you know, sweating a little bit and a pull over.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520]   And he said, sir, where, where's your, where can you tell me your whereabouts?
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   And I'm like, what is whereabouts to me?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   I'm like, what does that mean?
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   And he's like, he goes, uh, sir, where, where are you?
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   What, what are the, what's the largest cross street?
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.040]   And I tell him, and he said, sir, I need to know, uh, if your efforts to defraud the IRS
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.400]   were intentional.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   That was the question he asked me to which I said, is this a joke?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680]   I'm like, man, this is Dave and Marvin messing with me, man.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680]   That's what's going on.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920]   Got a Google number or something.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   And he goes, he goes, sir, I'm going to tell you again.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   This is officer McMillan.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.040]   You need to write this badge number down.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.200]   Do you have a pen and paper?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.280]   Write this down.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.400]   He said, nothing I am about to tell you in this conversation will be a laughing matter.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.760]   I assure you.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.400]   Let me ask you again, Mr. Percluta, were your efforts to defraud the IRS intentional to
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.420]   which I said, no, they were not intentional.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.120]   And he starts saying these things.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.840]   He said, well, listen, you know, we need to talk with you.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.880]   You're going to have to explain why you've done what you've done for the past three years.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.640]   And he begins to say some fairly specific data from 2012 and 2013.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.720]   And it was 2011, 2012, 2013.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.520]   You, you, you, whether intentional or unintentional did not pay all the taxes that you owed.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.840]   He goes, sir, we have already, we have already dispatched the local authorities.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.480]   He tells me you, you're going to have to plead your case before a judge, sir.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.600]   Is there anyone do you, would you like to make a phone call to let someone know where
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   you will be?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.960]   And I'm, I'm like picturing myself talking to Monica through the glass.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.800]   I'm like, call Todd and tell him, you know, I don't, I'm supposed to teach tomorrow at
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   the port.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   I don't listen.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   I just tell him I was arrested.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   It was, I don't know.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.040]   We're going to figure this out.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.240]   Take up an offering, you know, and about I'm on the phone with this Joker for an hour and
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.480]   20 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so finally I get to this place about an hour into the phone call.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.560]   I'm like, well, how much do I owe?
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   He tells me $3,700 to which I'm is a little bit of a relief.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   Cause I'm like, listen, I will beg, borrow and steal $3,700 if I need to.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   I listen, I don't want to go to jail.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.840]   And I go, can I make arrangements to pay?
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.360]   He says no.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.080]   So I'm like, okay, now I'm confused.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.880]   He's like, you need to go before the judge.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   There will be an opportunity.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.320]   And he's telling me all of this and through kind of this frustration back and forth eventually.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.720]   And I mean, he is being extremely rude.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.880]   And eventually I get off the phone with him as he tells me that the sheriff is on the
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.520]   way that I will soon be in the back of a police car with my hands handcuffed behind my back,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.200]   but I will have an opportunity in the next couple of weeks to plead my case before a
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.400]   judge and so I get off the phone with him.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.640]   I call my CPA.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.040]   I begin to tell him in a panic, I'm shaking.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.660]   I literally am shaking.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.320]   He cuts me off and says, it's a scam.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   He goes, everybody knows it's a scam.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:50.440]   All right, first of all, buddy, everybody does not know it's a scam.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.880]   And the fact that it's a scam would have been really good information an hour and 20 minutes
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   ago.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   And he's like, yeah, the IRS won't call you.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.960]   I'm like, what?
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.760]   It sounds like some of you might've known that, you know, thanks for telling me.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.100]   Thanks for letting me know, you know?
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.320]   And so here's the deal.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.060]   When someone comes at you and says you owe something, they have a power over you.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.380]   Like you're sitting there and you're like, okay, how am I going to work this out?
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.100]   And they get to define the terms of how you're going to work that out.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.220]   And so some of you, you grew up in church and you have this view of God and you know
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.460]   that your sins are debts against him.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.460]   And that's true.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.460]   That's good theology.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.100]   Your sins are indeed debts against the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.420]   But the problem, and this is where it breaks down is how he views those debts will certainly
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.480]   approach how you go to him.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.300]   Do you view him as someone scary like the IRS ready to throw you in prison or worse,
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.360]   throw you in hell?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   Are you here?
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.240]   And do you think, Hey, hell is a possibility for me.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.440]   There's a chance, you know, I may get up there.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   I may go down.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   I do every single week.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.520]   People appear that are like, yeah, I'm, I think I'm going to go to heaven.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.920]   I'm like, you think, you think, so there's a chance that you're walking around and there's
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.440]   a chance you're going to die and you're going to go to hell forever and ever and ever and
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   ever.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.920]   You tell me that's a possible reality.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.060]   How we view God and more specifically how we believe God views our sins certainly affects
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.680]   how we approach God.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.160]   And this is why this message is so unbelievably important because you cannot view, you cannot
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.200]   approach God appropriately if you do not understand how he views your sins.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.880]   So that's what we're talking about this evening.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.920]   How does God view your sins?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.040]   And specifically we're going to talk about what Jesus does, not just to our debt, but
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.600]   to our death, what Jesus does to our debt.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.280]   And before we leave here, what Jesus does to the demons who accuse us because it's in
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.600]   the text.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.280]   And so we're traveling through Colossians.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.200]   If you're just joining us, we're in a series in Colossians.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.400]   We're in Colossians chapter two.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   If you have your Bibles turned to the new Testament and you're going to go a little
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.640]   ways into the new Testament and past the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Acts, Romans,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:31.160]   first and second Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.280]   The church in Colossae has picked up a heresy.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.420]   What they've done is they've added to the gospel.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.440]   They said, what must be done to pay this debt against God?
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.080]   Well, certainly it's Jesus plus something else.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.480]   They began to add to it.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.900]   And so last week we awkwardly ended talking about circumcision, not just of the flesh,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.380]   but more specifically circumcision of the heart, that Christ, that in Christ, rather
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.240]   your sin nature has been removed.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   And so some of us were like, you're in like, wait a minute.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.920]   It doesn't feel like my sin nature is removed.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   I still sin sometimes.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.180]   And so this is the difficult already, not yet reality that we live in that, that God
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.920]   stands outside of time.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.960]   And that's something that happened 2000 years ago has tremendous implications for our presence
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.680]   at our present time and even bigger implications for our future.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:27.480]   When we stand before God that in Christ, we're being moved toward being sinless, but in Christ
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.360]   with God in the future, we will stand sinless.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.600]   It's this idea that God stands outside of time.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.400]   It's past, present, and future all working together.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.920]   That though, while you might sin right now, God is no longer counting those sins against
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   you.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.080]   This is second Corinthians five 19.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:55.160]   What would happen if we believe that God was no longer counting our sins against us?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.960]   Would we send more?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.480]   What do we send less?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.520]   How would we view sin?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.280]   This is directly from the scripture.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.920]   Second Corinthians five 19.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:11.380]   God to the believer, the person in Christ is no longer counting your sins against you.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:19.200]   And so God who stands outside of time sees us already as though we are sinless before
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.000]   him, pure and perfect.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.920]   Even though you will leave here and live, you will sin.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.160]   How does that mind blown?
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   Like, how does that work?
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   How does that happen?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.300]   That's why this text is so rich in Colossians.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.160]   So last week we said in him, you were also circumcised with the circumcision not performed
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.920]   by human hands.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.620]   Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.460]   That this sin nature in your heart, there was a circumcision that occurred in your heart.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.480]   It has been removed that.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.000]   And what that means is that in Christ you now no longer have to sin before Christ.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.500]   You had to sin.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.080]   You didn't have any choice but to sin, but now you don't have to sin.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.900]   The Holy Spirit strengthens you in the presence of sin so that there is a way out from sin.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.420]   So no one say, I can't stop.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.080]   I have to keep doing this.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   No, you don't.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   Not for the believer.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.160]   You absolutely can stop the spirit of God in you can give you the power to stop.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.100]   Verse 12, having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.880]   your faith in the working of God who raised him, that's Jesus from the dead.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.500]   When you were raised, when you were dead rather in your sins and in the uncircumcision of
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.960]   your flesh, God, God made you alive with Christ.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.440]   Now those are a lot of churchy words.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.120]   What do they mean?
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.300]   My first point this evening is that Jesus raises you from the dead.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.080]   Jesus raises you from the dead.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.720]   This is so important for Christians to understand.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.580]   Whenever I baptize someone, I say this, you have been buried with Christ in his death
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.420]   and raised with him to new life.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.840]   Just as you go down, you've been buried with Christ in his death and you raised to him
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   in new life.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.680]   That's what I say whenever I baptize someone.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   Water baptism is just a symbol.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   Okay.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   It is a metaphor.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   The scriptures give us.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.280]   It's much like a wedding ring.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.720]   I'm married.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.360]   I'm still married.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   Okay.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   The ring is a symbol of a covenant commitment that I've made.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.200]   Likewise, baptism is a declaration, a proclamation of a covenant commitment you've made to follow
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.800]   Christ.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   Now you are being identified with Jesus in his death and raised him being buried in the
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.680]   tomb and raised to new life.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   But that's not the baptism we're talking about here.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.920]   We're talking about a baptism of the spirit that happens at the point of conversion.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.080]   Now this is important.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   This is theology.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.280]   So stay with me and let me read this to you.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   A new convert is baptized by God.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:04.080]   God's doing the baptism into Christ's death and resurrection by faith in Jesus resulting
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   in a new life where sin is not necessary and without eternal consequence.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.700]   So who's doing the baptism?
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.700]   That's God.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.840]   What are you baptized into?
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   Not water, but Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:21.360]   How by faith in Jesus and what does it result in a new life, a brand new life, a life different
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:28.080]   from your old life, a new life where sin is not necessary and without eternal consequence.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   Don't answer it.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.600]   Some of you would answer differently.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.240]   Does the Christian have to be baptized?
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.720]   The answer is yes.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.280]   By the spirit or into the spirit you already have been if you are indeed a Christian.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.440]   That happened at conversion.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.520]   And does a Christian have to be baptized in the water?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.080]   The answer is yes.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.120]   To be obedient, not to be saved.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   The scripture commands us to be baptized.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.080]   So if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ, you haven't been baptized, you
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.520]   should get baptized.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   That is to be obedient.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.320]   Do I have to be baptized in order to get to heaven?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   No.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.520]   No, you have to trust in Jesus, his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.720]   sins to get to heaven.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   But to walk in obedience as a Christian, you will get baptized.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.020]   You've been identified with Jesus and as Jesus was raised to new life, so are you.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:25.120]   This is very difficult to understand that something that happened 2000 years ago, you
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.920]   you benefited from the day you were there with Jesus, your sin, your materialism, your
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.580]   pride, your self-righteousness, your pornography.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.320]   It was nailed to the cross with Christ.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.920]   It was crucified with Christ.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.620]   Jesus goes in the grave and he comes out without your sin.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.620]   Even though that happened in the past, it's like you benefit from it now as you live now
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.820]   in Christ, as you trust in Christ, you benefit from it.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.240]   Then it's very difficult.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240]   It feels philosophical.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.920]   But last week we talked about how the circumcision was a shadow of something to come, that for
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.000]   thousands of years, guys were removing their flesh as a symbol of Jesus coming to circumcise
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   our heart.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.900]   Guys, for thousands of years, Jews would practice this cleansing of baptism.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.980]   That was a foreshadowing.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.320]   They had no idea that Jesus, their savior would be buried in a tomb and raised to new
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320]   life.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.860]   It was pointing to something in the future that Christ is, will be buried and raised
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.220]   to new life.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.600]   It's another symbol.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:34.700]   And we're not just talking about washing away your sins, but being raised to new life.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.700]   And so it's the past, present and future working together.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.900]   In the past, Christ's burial and resurrection.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.380]   The present, buried with Jesus and alive without needing to sin.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.900]   And in the future, one day you will literally raise from the dead.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:55.740]   One day, if you've trusted in that, you will absolutely, positively, for sure, literally
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.060]   raise from the grave as God defeats death in your life.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.820]   But that new life starts right now.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.740]   Okay, summarize, I lost some of you.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.900]   Let me just hit you with this.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:13.700]   Jesus did not come to make bad people good, but dead people alive.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.300]   Jesus did not come to make bad people good, but dead people alive.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.100]   Your sins did not just identify you as bad.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.500]   When you were a sinner, you were dead in your sins.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.260]   You had no hope for the future.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.660]   You were hell bound.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.940]   You were going to go to hell.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.140]   There's no, I might go to hell.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.480]   I might go to heaven.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.180]   One minute you're going to hell.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.940]   One second later, the Holy Spirit has come upon your life and you are going to heaven,
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.300]   for sure, absolutely.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.940]   You were dead and Christ made you alive.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.820]   Well, what if I'm here and I've trusted in Christ, but I don't feel alive?
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.620]   The same thing, one of two things.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.660]   You either did not trust in him or you're not trusting in him right now.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.740]   You're not abiding in him.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.060]   You're not walking with him.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.860]   Jesus did not come to make bad people good, but dead people alive.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.780]   This is where we get this idea from the scripture of being born again.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.180]   That there's new birth, that there was a past life behind you and a new life in front of
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.540]   you, that you live a new life in Christ.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.180]   You're born again Christian.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.840]   Every single believer in the room has two lives.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.260]   You had a life when you were dead and you've been made alive in Christ.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.860]   I remember when I couldn't do anything but sin and now I'm made alive.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.860]   I've been born again.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.860]   It's a second birth.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:30.060]   I've got three kids, so I've been in that room for the birth three times.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:36.460]   Some people say it's beautiful.
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.660]   It's horrible.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.840]   That's the truth.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.020]   Lots of screaming, lots of blood.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   It's awful.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.020]   It's an awful thing.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.540]   I mean, the result is beautiful.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.540]   Baby's there.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.540]   It's amazing.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.020]   Weston, Presley, Finley, my kids, I'm there in the room.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   I'm with their mom.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   They're not in the room.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.780]   Then all of a sudden, nobody comes in or out of the room and then they're in the room.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.780]   It's amazing.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.780]   That kid was born.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.780]   Wow.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.140]   I'm there for moral support, honestly.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.140]   I can't do anything.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.140]   I'm like, "You want to hold my hand?"
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   "No!"
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.140]   "Okay.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.500]   What can I do?"
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.820]   She is working really, really hard and they, the one who are being born, they're not doing
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.500]   anything.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.060]   They didn't do anything to be born.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   That's the reality of it.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.180]   You didn't do anything to be born.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.180]   Not a single thing.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.180]   You didn't crawl out of the womb.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.180]   No, nothing.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.060]   You didn't decide, "Hey, now's the time."
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.060]   You didn't start to push.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   No, she pushed.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   You didn't push.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   Right?
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.340]   Likewise, you didn't do anything to be born again.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.660]   Not a thing.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.220]   God did the work.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.300]   Christ did the work on the cross 2,000 years ago.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   That's it.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   You didn't do anything.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   "Wait a minute.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   What?
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   I didn't...
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   Nothing?"
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   Nothing.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.020]   God saved you in spite of you.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.100]   Verse 13, "God made you alive with Christ.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.800]   He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   stood against us and condemned us.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.660]   He has taken it away, nailing it to the cross."
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.980]   In this culture, which Paul is writing to in the church of Colossae, if you had a debt
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.540]   over you, it would hang over you.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.460]   You would carry that debt around.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.540]   No one would lend you money.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.720]   In fact, if you borrowed money to eat, you couldn't eat anymore because no one would
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.980]   give you money so that you could eat.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.580]   Like this was life or death situation.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.180]   There was no credit score here.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   So this...
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.940]   And not in a dissimilar way, the way that your credit score will determine whether someone's
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.740]   going to lend you money or not.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.260]   If you don't pay back your debts or you have too much debt and they say, "Hey, no, we cannot
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260]   lend you anymore."
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.940]   Likewise then, if somebody had lent you money, no one else would lend you money until that
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.940]   debt was paid.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.420]   And so this language that your debt has been canceled, that it's been crossed out, this
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.800]   is huge language because when you would sit with the person of whom you owed money to,
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.900]   they would sit you there, they'd have your name on a general ledger and they would have
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.860]   how much you owed or what you owed them and they would cross it out or they would smear
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.860]   it.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.540]   And this was a joyful day to you.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.980]   This meant you could eat again.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.500]   This meant you could borrow money or do business again, that you were no longer the person
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.080]   known in the community as the one in debt.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.300]   This meant new life for you.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.260]   And so my second point this evening is Jesus crossed out our debts.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.320]   In the same way that that was a day of freedom, the debts that we have against God are sin.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.900]   Jesus crossed out our debts.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.740]   Some of us here this evening, we have the wrong view of sin and some of us have the
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.560]   wrong view of payment.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.900]   So let's start with your sin.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.040]   Your sin is against an eternal God.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.440]   The terms of your debt that your sin has accrued is eternal.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.620]   Like the terms of my mortgage might be 30 years, like maybe I'm speaking hypothetically,
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.600]   my mortgage might be for $200,000 that I have to pay out over 30 years.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   Okay.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.160]   The debt that your sin has accrued against the eternal God is infinite, paid out over
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   eternity.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.240]   There is only one place that you can pay for your debt and that's eternity.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.860]   That's it.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.240]   It takes an eternal payment because it's an eternal debt.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:24.120]   Anytime you sin against an eternal being, the debt that you've accrued is eternal.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.240]   So let's talk about the payment.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.440]   I can't just tell the IRS, "I'll pay my taxes this year."
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.400]   No, I've got to go pay them this year and I've got to pay the back taxes of any years
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   that I missed it.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.080]   Well, your sin, the debt you owe against God, because it's eternal, it requires an eternal
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.200]   payment.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   Here's what that means.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.760]   So if I go to God and I say, "Hey, my friend Greg has sinned against you, God.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.640]   I want to give you my life for his life so that he can go to heaven."
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.920]   God's going to say, "But who's going to pay for your life?
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.240]   Your life is marked by sin.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.280]   Your life has debt.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.420]   So you don't have the ability to pay for Greg's sin."
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.080]   It would take a perfect person.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.620]   And the perfect person could only cover Greg for a lifetime.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.400]   It would take an eternal perfect person to cover Greg for all eternity.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.280]   Now, do you see the brilliance of the payment on the cross?
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   That it took an eternal God who was also sinless, without debt himself, to pay the debt for
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.960]   your sin.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   And so Christ offers an eternal payment as an eternal perfect God.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.600]   And so in salvation, you are now identified with Christ.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.280]   That was the baptism part.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.080]   Apart from Christ, you are identified by your sin.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.620]   Apart from Christ, you're the one who had an abortion.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.820]   Apart from Christ, you're the pornographer.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.960]   Apart from Christ, you're the materialist.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.720]   Apart from Christ, you're the sinner.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.600]   In Christ, you're the one who's been forgiven for those things.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.640]   No longer identified by them, but for the forgiveness of them.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.680]   That's the beauty of the cross.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:07.240]   An eternal God paid, an eternal sinless God paid for your sins.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.200]   Your debt is bigger than you can pay.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.000]   So God paid it.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.620]   I had these two friends.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.760]   One of them owned a business.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.240]   He was a builder.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.120]   And they were in community together.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.960]   And he wanted my other friend, I'll call him John, he wanted John to partner with him.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.340]   And so he comes to John and he says, "Hey, I would like you to go in business with me."
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.080]   And John looks at him and says, "I can't.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.800]   I have too many student loans.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.000]   I can't go into business with you.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.840]   I can't take a risk right now like owning a business.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.520]   I have too much debt in my life.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.080]   I need to go work hard and pay off that debt."
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.920]   And so they continued to live in community.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.360]   And my friend saw the kind of character that John had and understood who he was and really
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.760]   wanted to partner with him.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   And so he goes to him again and says, "Hey, I would like to partner with you."
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.960]   John says, "Hey, I told you I can't.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   I have too much debt."
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.040]   To which my friend said, "What debt?"
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.960]   "It's been taken care of.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.560]   Let's do business together.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.840]   Like I want a relationship with you that bad.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.620]   I'll pay whatever debt is against you.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.360]   Even though it's not my debt, even though I did nothing for you to accrue that debt,
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.880]   I will pay that debt on your behalf so that we can partner together.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.920]   This is what God is telling you.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.640]   I know about the pornography.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.080]   I know about the pride.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.600]   I know about the self-righteousness.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.880]   I know about the abortion.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.360]   I know about the drunkenness.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.640]   I know about the parties.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.960]   I know about the sex.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.280]   I know about the lust.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.880]   I know about it all.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.040]   And I want a relationship with you so bad that I paid the debt that it's accrued.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.640]   It's been crossed out.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.200]   Can we partner?
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:55.080]   Not in the future, but right now.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.720]   Can we partner together?
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.400]   God paid it for you.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.320]   And this is bigger than you think.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.720]   It is past, present, and future.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.320]   Because he paid for future debts.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   He loves you right now, even though he knows tomorrow you're going to run from him.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.840]   That seems irresponsible.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.440]   Like we would never do that.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.840]   You wouldn't take that boyfriend back.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.680]   You knew he was going to cheat on you tomorrow.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   Maybe you would.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.480]   You shouldn't.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.200]   But God does this to you.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.400]   He says, "I've paid for your debts, past, present, and future.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.480]   They've been crossed out through an eternal payment of a sinless, perfect sacrifice in
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.800]   my one and only son, Jesus Christ."
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.320]   So let me ask you a question.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.520]   How can you pay a debt that's already been paid?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.120]   You can't.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.400]   You can't.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.120]   I was getting my hair cut the other day and was sharing the gospel with a guy.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.840]   He got to the part.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.080]   He had just finished up and I paid him for my haircut.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.640]   And he said, "No, man.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.360]   I know about Jesus, man.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.720]   I've just done too much, man.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   You just don't know.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   Like, I've done a lot."
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.960]   So I believe in Jesus, but man, when I get up there, I'm really going to have to answer
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.160]   for some of the things I've done down here.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.600]   And I said, "Let me ask you a question, bro."
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.320]   I said, "What if somebody comes in right after me and they say, 'Hey, I'd like to pay for
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   his haircut'?"
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   And he goes, "Well, you just paid me."
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   I go, "I know, I know.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   Let me ask you again.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.680]   If someone comes in here right after me and they say, 'Hey, I'd like to pay for his haircut,'
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   what are you going to tell them?"
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.400]   He goes, "I'm going to tell them that you already paid.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.840]   It's already paid for."
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   And I go, "Cool.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.720]   What if they say, 'Well, I'd like to pay for just a little bit of it'?"
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.040]   And he goes, "You paid for all of it."
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   I go, "No, I know."
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.280]   So if they say, "Hey, I'd like to pay for a little bit of his haircut," what are you
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   going to tell them?
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   They say, "He covered it.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   It's all paid for."
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   I said, "Exactly.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.640]   That's what God is telling you right now.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.200]   It's all paid for.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.680]   100% of it has been paid for.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.880]   Like, are you guys tracking with that?"
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   All of it.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.120]   It's all paid for.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   Every one of them.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.520]   They're not like you didn't pay for 90% of them.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   He didn't pay for every one.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.040]   That's a really, really bad one.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.200]   He paid for all of them.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.400]   Yours and anyone who would trust in his provision of payment through his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.120]   They've been paid for.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.120]   All of them.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.080]   100% of them.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.520]   I was speaking in Austin two weeks ago for this deal called Resurrection Week on the
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.960]   campus of UT.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.720]   I stepped down, literally come down off the stage, and I'm walking around to the back,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.320]   and this girl cuts me off in the bushes.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   It was awkward and dark, and I was scared.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   She was angry.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.040]   I mean, angry women are scary.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.560]   I'm like ... She goes, "Hey, something you said really bothered me."
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   I said, "Okay.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.240]   Well, what did I say?"
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.920]   She goes, "You said that God was no longer counting our sins against us."
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   I was like, "Okay.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   Help me understand what happened."
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.560]   She said, "You said drug use, sex, and eating disorders.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.200]   You said that God was no longer counting my eating disorder against me."
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.280]   I said, "That's good news, right?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   What's the problem?"
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   She goes, "You put it with drugs and sex."
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.840]   She goes, "I don't choose an eating disorder."
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   I said, "Okay.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   Well, help me understand.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   Let's talk about your eating disorder.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   I want to understand better."
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.880]   I said, "Forgive me for what I said.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.000]   It sounds like it could have easily been misunderstood, and I don't want to do that."
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   We talked through that.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.520]   I mean, she was angry.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.000]   Irate, red in the face.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.480]   Tears started streaming down her face.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.280]   "I don't want to do it.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.000]   I don't want to do that anymore."
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I said, "Okay.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.400]   Well, let me ask you two questions.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.480]   Between one and ten, ten being certain, one being not so sure, if you died right now,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.040]   how certain are you that you'd go to heaven?"
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   She goes, "I'm pretty sure."
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.360]   She goes, "I'm like 80 percent."
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.680]   I said, "Okay."
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   I said, "Okay.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   Well, you stand up there.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   You get up there."
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   God says, "Why should I let you in?
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.160]   What would you say?"
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.720]   "Because I've tried so hard to stop."
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.000]   She tells me, tears running down her face.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.280]   "I've tried so hard to stop."
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.080]   I said, "I know why you're upset.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.720]   I know why God has us talking right now."
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:29.280]   I said, "When you get up there, if you try to point to your efforts, you've missed the
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.960]   gospel.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.880]   The only reason anyone gets into heaven is because God paid their way to him through
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.520]   Jesus.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.480]   He's not holding that eating disorder against you.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   Would you agree that in a perfect world, there would be no eating disorder?"
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.840]   She said, "Yes."
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.240]   I said, "In a perfect world, you wouldn't binge eat and then throw up.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.720]   You wouldn't binge eat and then binge work out.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.600]   That wouldn't exist in a perfect world.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   True?"
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   She said, "Yes."
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   Tears running down her face.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.720]   I said, "It's been paid for on the cross."
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.920]   I said, "So how sure are you that you would get to heaven?"
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   She says, "80%."
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   I said, "Why?"
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.760]   She said, "Because Jesus paid for my sins."
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.440]   I looked at her and I said, "80% of your sins?
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.720]   How many of your sins did he pay for?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   He paid for 80% of them?"
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.360]   She said, "No, all of them.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.720]   Every one of them."
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   I write these things to you.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.120]   Believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:41.920]   First John 5 says, "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.320]   of them, triumphing over them by the cross."
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.800]   How amazing is this picture?
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.780]   "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he, Jesus Christ, made a public spectacle
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.960]   of them, triumphing over them by the cross."
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.880]   My third point is that Jesus disarmed the demons.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   Jesus disarmed the demons.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.280]   This picture is so perfect.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.520]   It's so beautiful.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.960]   To the Roman Empire, this would have been really familiar.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   So what would happen when you would conquer a territory, when you would conquer an empire,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.160]   you would take all of their possessions as your own.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.080]   You would shackle them.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.480]   You would do a triumphal march.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.160]   You would parade them, chained and shackled.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   All of their stuff.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.200]   You would be stripped of all of their stuff, them being humiliated and disarmed.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.520]   The very sword that they carried to kill you with was now your sword.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   Do you see that?
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.640]   Jesus disarmed the demons.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.020]   He disarmed the enemy.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.560]   He took away the power.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.640]   Jesus removes the power from the enemy in the cross.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.240]   Jesus removes the power from the enemy in the cross.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:59.480]   Have you ever seen someone triumphal in victory?
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   Of course you have.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.880]   Any athletic event, right?
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.360]   The World Series, Super Bowl, National Championship.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.360]   Whenever they win, there's lots of fist pumps, lots of shouting, lots of hooray, lots of
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.520]   hugs, lots of tears.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.440]   You win a big game, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.960]   You've seen all of that.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   You've seen people triumph.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   This is Jesus' end zone dance.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.120]   You guys know end zone dance?
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.360]   Familiar with that term?
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.360]   I'm in downtown.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.520]   Monica and I are on a date.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.160]   It's Texas OU weekend a couple years ago.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:42.360]   There's this stage downtown by the W. I'm walking and this guy on the stage says, "Hey,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.720]   we're going to have an end zone celebration competition."
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.440]   End zone celebration competition.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.640]   I'm an innocent bystander.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:55.320]   I'm walking by, but it was the one day, true confession, it was the one day I wore skinny
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   jeans.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   Okay?
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.200]   Community was not involved in that decision.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:06.080]   So I've got these pencil stick legs walking around and this guy on the stage decided he
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.680]   wanted to pick on the tall guy with the skinny jeans.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.280]   He says, "Hey, you, come on up here.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   End zone celebration."
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.960]   I'm like, "No, not me."
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.400]   He goes, "Hey man, listen."
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.640]   He gets my wife involved.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   "Bring him up here.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   Bring him."
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.640]   She's like, "Go up there."
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.600]   So then he tells me, so I'm up there.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.640]   Yeah, betrayal like Judas.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.560]   I'm up there.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   I'm up there.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.280]   And then he tells me the prize is a night at the W. I'm with my honey.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.440]   You know, I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to dance my heart out."
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.440]   Okay?
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.600]   Like you're about to get centipede, you know, cabbage patch and booty shake.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.880]   It's all happening right now.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.920]   And so they play, there's two other people.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   They play the music.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   I wobbled.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   Okay?
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   It happened.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   It happened.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.120]   Victory was mine.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:57.440]   $100 to the W. And I tell you all of that to say, that's what Jesus is doing.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   Kind of.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.000]   Not really.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.360]   Now, let me tell you what he's doing.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.040]   In a complicated term that I want to be really clear, lots of metaphors tonight.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.360]   The cross was jujitsu.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   Okay?
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.880]   I got your attention.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.920]   Check this out because this is powerful.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.680]   In jujitsu, like the fundamental of jujitsu, the fundamental reality of jujitsu is that
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.440]   you use someone's force against them.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.880]   You know, they throw a punch and you use the momentum in that punch to throw them off balance
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.640]   and to counter.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.520]   And so what's happening in the cross is since Jesus has showed up on the scene, now you
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   track them with this.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.200]   This is an important thing.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.720]   Using someone's momentum against them.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.760]   Okay?
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   That's what you need to know.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.360]   So in the cross, since Jesus shows up on the scene, Satan, the enemy, the accuser is trying
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.080]   to kill him since the day he shows up in Bethlehem.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.800]   And so this moment, this is the greatest moment of Satan.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.440]   It's the history of history.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   Satan sees Jesus on the cross to tell us last breath.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.640]   And he's just like, yes, I mean, demons are high fiving.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.080]   It's a celebration.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.120]   It's a party.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.440]   It's an empty tomb.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.960]   It's forgiveness for all your sins.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.480]   How did this happen?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.600]   He took the momentum that the enemy, all the things, the work that the enemy was trying
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:35.200]   to do, and he did the greatest twist of all time, offering forgiveness for anyone sins
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.480]   who would trust in the cross, canceling their debt, defeating death.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.000]   All the things, those are languages of the enemy, demons, debt, death.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.400]   Those are the enemy's tools.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.080]   He takes their sword and uses it against them.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.640]   He disarmed them.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:59.040]   It says in the scripture, the very sword that was used to kill you is now your sword.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.440]   The very tool the enemy used to ultimately celebrate became the greatest catastrophe
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.920]   toward the enemy.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.520]   The cross becomes an empty tomb.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:17.360]   The dead God on the cross becomes forgiveness for your sins.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:26.480]   How beautiful is that?
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.640]   So the enemy, what he wanted to use to kill you, God uses to bring life to others.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.160]   Think about that.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:40.560]   He wanted to use your abortion to kill you, and God takes it and he uses it to set those
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.680]   who have had abortions free.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.280]   He wanted to use your sexual addiction to kill you, and when you bring it to the light
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.120]   and you say, "This is part of my story," God breathes power into it, and he uses it to
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   set others free.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:03.040]   He wanted to use your pride and self-righteousness and religiosity and churchism to kill you,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.120]   and when you say, "God, these are the things you died for," those things become powerful.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:16.760]   They become tools that God then uses to set others free, jujitsu, using the enemy's momentum
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   against them.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:23.500]   So while the enemy thinks he's won, God takes the cross and raises you from the dead, crosses
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:30.840]   out your debts, and disarms the demons.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.280]   We just celebrated the cross on Good Friday and the empty tomb on Easter.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.440]   This should be fresh on your minds, but I just want to end by pointing out some beautiful
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.640]   realities about the cross, some things that I get really, really excited about, and I
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.200]   think you will too.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.760]   There's so much going on on the cross.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.440]   There's so many prophecies being fulfilled in the cross, and so I'll share just a few
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   with you.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:58.740]   Did you know that the sacrificial Passover lamb would not break a bone?
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.240]   This is a command given to us in Exodus, that whenever they were going to sacrifice the
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.800]   Passover lamb, they could not break a bone in it.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.080]   What is the Passover lamb?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.120]   The Passover lamb is from when the Holy Spirit passed over God's people because they shed
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.160]   the lamb's blood on the door.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.360]   So therefore their firstborn son was not killed.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   Does this ring a bell?
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   Anybody?
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.400]   Oh yeah, I remember that from Sunday school class.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.360]   So God's people are there.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:29.480]   God has sent the ten plagues against Pharaoh, saying, "Hey, let my people go," and the last
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.800]   of the plague is killing the firstborn son, and God says to his people, "Hey, sacrifice
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.280]   a spotless lamb.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.120]   Put his blood on the doorpost.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.800]   My spirit will pass over you, and your son will live."
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.080]   This is a foreshadowing of what's to come.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.000]   Jesus is the perfect, eternal, sacrificial lamb.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.960]   Did you know that his bones were not broken?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.080]   This was to fulfill the prophecy in Psalm 34, verse 20.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   See what happened?
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.700]   It was customary in the crucifixion.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.600]   Every time someone was crucified, the last thing they would do is they'd go and break
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.160]   their shins, because what would happen is you'd hang down, and you would die of asphyxiation.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.880]   You couldn't breathe like that, not supported by your legs.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.200]   But when they came to Jesus, so they break the shins of both the thieves right beside
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.880]   Jesus, they come to Jesus, and he's already dead.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:23.440]   So they don't break his legs in fulfillment of this prophecy, and consistent with the
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.040]   sacrificial lamb, showing that Jesus was the perfect sacrifice.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.600]   Now instead, what do they do?
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.080]   They take a spear, and they stab him in the side.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.680]   Now why would they do that?
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:41.440]   Well, because God had said in Psalm 22, verse 14, that his blood must pour out like water.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.240]   And so what poured out from Jesus' side was not blood, but water.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   Why?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.160]   Because his blood had already poured out, covering all your sins.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.040]   He had no more blood left.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.240]   All of this in fulfillment of the prophecies there on the cross, things that had been written
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:03.560]   thousands of years before the cross, that Jesus would die for your sins, and that his
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:10.160]   blood would cover your sins, canceling out that debt.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:16.080]   But I want to show you my new favorite one, my favorite observation that comes from studying
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.720]   this text in Colossians chapter 2.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:26.620]   Did you know that when a person was crucified, what was nailed to them on the cross along
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.280]   with their body was their sentence?
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.920]   So if you had stolen something, it would say, "Thief on the cross with you."
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.620]   You would be identified as a thief there, dead on a cross.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.000]   If you had been committed murder, then you would be on the cross, and your sin, or your
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.820]   sentence rather, would be nailed to the cross with you.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.820]   So what was Jesus' sentence?
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.160]   Did you know there was something nailed to the cross with him?
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.360]   There was, let me tell you.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.920]   It's John 19, verse 19.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   Pontius Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened it to the cross.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.440]   It read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.800]   Many of the Jews read the sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.040]   and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.760]   The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,'
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.280]   but that this man claimed to be the King of the Jews."
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.520]   And Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.920]   That what was above Jesus, you may have seen it, "Inri," which is just Latin in abbreviation
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.260]   for "The King of the Jews."
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.120]   His sin, as he's crucified, is that he's king.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.800]   Not claimed to be king, but literally king.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.560]   It's true jujitsu.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:04.240]   That God, I'm serious, that God would go to him and that they would hang this sign
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   above his head.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:33.800]   That he was a sinless sacrifice, an eternal sacrifice, and enough sacrifice by those who
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:40.560]   scorned him and laughed at him and tortured him and killed him.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.280]   That he's canceling out the debt of your sins.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:51.760]   Every sin you've committed, fulfilling the prophecy that he was indeed king, that there's
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.280]   no question.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.480]   But you know what is nailed to the cross with him?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:04.000]   Not just that sign, but here in Colossians 2, it says, "Your sin."
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.560]   That Jesus is up there paying very specifically for that time you went too far, drank too
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:20.440]   much, watched that thing, said that thing, bought that thing, did that.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.400]   The unmentionables of your life and your past, your present and your future, that God paid
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   for.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:34.560]   And check this out, you're no longer identified by your sin, but that you've been forgiven
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.480]   for them.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.760]   As we sing this last song in worship, you're going to see some of my friends who in the
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.420]   past when they were dead in their sins were identified by their sins.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:52.360]   But God has taken those debts and he's canceled them.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:57.760]   Jesus indeed has paid it all.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:20.400]   Let's worship him now.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:49.000]  , "Jesus is up there paying very specifically for that time you went too far, drank too
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   much, watched that thing, said that thing, bought that thing, did that."
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:11.960]   And I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small, child of weakness, watch
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:25.800]   and pray, and find in me thine all in all.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   Because Jesus paid all, all to him I owe.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:46:10.000]   For now indeed I find thy power and thine alone can change the leper's spots and melt
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   the heart of stone.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Because Jesus paid all, all to him I owe.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   White as snow.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   White as snow.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   White as snow.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   White as snow.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Don't praise the one who paid my debt and he's canceled them.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Don't praise the one who paid my debt and he raises life up from the dead.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Jesus.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   It's only Jesus.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Jesus paid all, all to him I owe.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   White as snow.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   White as snow.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   White as snow.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.920]   White as snow.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:49:02.120]   He washed it white as snow.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.680]   I love this verse in Colossians 1.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:10.840]   We covered it the second week we were in this book and it just says, "Once," listen to this,
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.000]   "Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:27.360]   behavior, but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.080]   you wholly in his sight without blemish."
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.760]   He doesn't see the guy dead in porn.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.080]   He doesn't see the girl who had the abortion.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.600]   He sees the girl who's been forgiven for the abortion.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:46.880]   He doesn't see the dude who's just completely dead in his pride.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:55.400]   He sees the payment, what he paid through his son.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:04.200]   Having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood out against us and condemned us,
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:11.360]   he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross, not just nailing it, but literally covering
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.640]   it in the same way that they would take that and smear it, right, all the way across.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.800]   I'm going to make sure I get weed too.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:28.200]   This is for you, Lance.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:34.480]   You're lucky I'm tall.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:41.000]   He made a mess to clean you up.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.240]   He's canceled out your debts.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:53.120]   You see yours up here?
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.000]   You see the one you did?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   It's not up there.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.840]   I promise you it was there at Calvary.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.520]   If you've trusted in him, it was there.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.080]   It was up there with Jesus.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.680]   It was nailed to the cross.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   You've been forgiven.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:26.600]   Walk forgiven, raised a new life, not to return to those grave clothes, not to return to that
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:36.680]   old life, not to take grace for granted, but to live fully for him.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:44.560]   He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation, for by him all
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:50.160]   things were created, things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.860]   He was the sacrificial lamb.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.080]   He was the perfect payment.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.760]   He was the eternal God.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:05.240]   He was the king, not just of the Jews, but of you, the only one that could take away
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.320]   your sins, setting them aside, nailing them to the cross.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.880]   It's Jesus.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.360]   Let me pray to him.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:23.200]   Father, would you hit our hearts with this reality, God, that we no longer have to live
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:30.080]   dead in our sin, but that you paid for it, and it wasn't a cheap payment.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.840]   It cost you the life, Jesus.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   It cost you your life.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:47.400]   You triumphed over the enemy, the accuser, the one who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy,
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   giving us victory in the cross.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.720]   It's in his name.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   Amen.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:03.760]   Hey, guys, every now and then we do something worthy of getting the attention of others,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   telling the story.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.960]   And so we've done this before, and we want to try to do this tonight, not in a gimmicky
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.520]   way, and not to bring more people here for sure, but to share the glory of our God, our
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.000]   Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.640]   And so we do this through social media.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.280]   It's just kind of the communication method of our time.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.980]   And so if you know that you have a sin that's been crossed out, we would just encourage
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.880]   you to tweet that sin or put it on Instagram or the social media of your choosing using
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   the hashtag #CrossedOut.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:36.740]   C-R-O-S-S-E-D-O-U-T, #CrossedOut.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.560]   And so if we can help you in that, if you're here and you want to talk with someone, there's
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.280]   going to be an entire team of folks up here ready to talk with you, pray with you, celebrate
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.440]   with you, all that God is doing in your life.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.920]   If there's anything we can do, if there's any way that we can serve you, we would love
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   to hear from you.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.760]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.400]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.980]   (upbeat music)
