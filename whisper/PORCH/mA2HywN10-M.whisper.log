[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Such an honor. Such an honor to be here. Listen, gratitude and honor is a beautiful thing.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And I was praying right there, I was just like, "God, I don't want to get in the way of you."
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   You know, because I can be a big personality, you know, and I don't want to distract you from the Word with illustrations.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Before I dive in, I just want to express my own gratitude for God working through this place,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   through that man. There's so many people behind the scenes that make this happen that you have no idea.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Like, this is so liturgical. Liturgy means "of the people." This is such a liturgical event
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   because so many people huddle around and say, "What if we get these balloons?"
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And, "What if we do this by the pond?" And, "What if we..." And they just dream big.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And it's your peers and they make this happen under the leadership,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   the incredible leadership covering elders of this place through his leadership.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And it feels like, you know, how does it feel? It feels like, you know, my little brother grew up.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   You know, that's what it feels like. So I'm just... I love you so much, David.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I love this team so much. It's such an honor to be with you guys and really dive into God's Word here in a bit.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I can remember, like, this is a little bit PTSD for me because I...
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   My first kind of experience of a church conference, right? I'm in high school.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And I have this crush on this girl, you know?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Now, it was bothering me too, Alex. Thank you. I was like, "Whose coffee is this?"
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So I've got this crush. I've got this crush on this young woman.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And I'm thinking, like... And she invites me. She says, "Hey, my church.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We're all going over to, you know, the big city because I'm from a small town.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And we're going to, you know, worship and sing and hear teachings. You want to go?"
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, man. That just sounds amazing. I would love to. I'd love to go."
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And so I go over there. And, you know, it's a little bit uncomfortable for me because people are raising their hands.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I grew up Catholic. You know, people are raising their hands and worshiping and doing all the things.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So I'm just trying not to embarrass myself in front of the crush, you know?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And they say, "Hey, we're going to have a singing contest." Right?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And I'm like, "This is my chance."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And so there's thousands of people there. We're in this arena. There's speakers.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's the biggest kind of Christian recording artists at that time.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And they're like, "We're going to have a singing contest. And so we're going to choose three of you."
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, I'm in the balcony, right? But I just run down the stairs and run to the stage like, "Me, me, me, me."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And they're like, "We'll take you." And I'm like, "Yes, praise God."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And so they chose—it was a young woman, me, and another dude.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And we're going to sing "Amazing Grace."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And so, yeah, and so—and I'm like—and I remember I looked up just like that.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And there was a big screen. I had this Tommy Hilfiger plaid shirt.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And I just saw my big old Tommy Hilfiger shirt right there on the screen.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And then I started looking around. I got real nervous, you know?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so the young woman sings first, you know, "Amazing Grace."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   She crushed it. Everybody's like just going nuts.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Like her church is cheering. And it's my turn.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And the guy's playing the piano, so he cues us in.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And he's like some famous guy at the time, you know.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   He's playing—he plays the piano, and so it's my turn.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And she just crushed it. She nailed her cue.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   She sang "Amazing Grace." Everybody went up.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was my turn, and he plays the piano, and then he stops.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And he looks at me, and he goes, "That was your cue."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm like, "Oh, man, my bad." You know?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I'm like, "Oh, we're going to do the 1-4. I'm used to the 2-6. Okay, that's fine."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And so he plays the piano again, and then he stops.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And he looks at me, and he goes, "You going to go?"
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, yeah, yeah. I got it this time. Third time's the charm. Let's go."
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And so he plays the piano. He starts playing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I don't even know when I'm supposed to come in, but I just start singing.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And it came out this squeaky falsetto, you know.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Like I was like, "Amazing grace."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I went through it. I went the whole way, man. The whole way.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And afterwards, just like you guys, they didn't know whether to—
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   they didn't know if it was a joke or like they should feel sorry for me.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You know, they were like—the question, I could almost hear it from the stage.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I was like, "Was he serious?" You know, that was the question.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So essentially, I learned that I couldn't sing in front of thousands of people.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Right? It was like that's how I figured that out.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And what it did for me, what it did for me is it made me never want to sing again.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Like I just was like, "I'm going to keep my mouth shut." Right?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I don't have the gift. Some people have the gift.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Some people don't have the gift. I clearly don't have the gift.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   That's what their laughter communicated to me. That's what their response communicated to me.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So I'm never going to sing again.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I think this is how a lot of us think about evangelism.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You think, "Oh man, there's people with the gift and people who don't have the gift.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And if I don't have the gift, then I'm going to keep my mouth shut so that those who do have the gift can share the gospel."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And I want you to know that that is not an option.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You can read this book, Genesis to Revelation.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Nowhere in this book are you going to find permission to not share your faith.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "Oh, but I'm an Enneagram 6 God and I'm an introvert. Enneagram 4. People scare me. You know this. So surely I have an out."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   No out.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And I think it matters way more than you think it does.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's such a significant part of church history, of Christianity, of the church, of discipleship.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Who here can sing?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You can feel free to nominate your friend. You're like, "No, I can sing. I got it. I can sing."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'll go, uh, I'll go, I'll go, Freddie.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He doesn't know. I know Freddie and I know he can sing, but he didn't know how to do it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Give us just a little bit of, here, stand up for me. Stand up for me.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Give us a little Amazing Grace.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Like, just give me your best, like you're trying out for American Idol or whatever. The voice.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Amazing Grace.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Yeah, okay. That's powerful, man. That's powerful. Okay. All right. You can sing.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That's not what happened to me.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I was thinking about going, "Amen."
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Hey, sing it one more time with your mouth closed. Don't open your mouth.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   [Humming]
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So yeah, you're humming, right?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   We might, and we might be able to recognize the lyrics if the song is familiar to us,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   but for him to sing the song, he's going to have to open his mouth.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And that's what I want you to know as you leave this place, for you to share the gospel.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Thank you, Freddie, so much.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   For you to share the gospel, you're going to have to open your mouth.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   There's this saying that circles around Christendom,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   "Preach the gospel everywhere you go, and when necessary, use words."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Cute saying, looks great on a coffee mug, accredited largely to Francis of Assisi,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   but here's the deal. To share the gospel, you have to use words.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Okay? You have to. Like, I don't care if it's sign language or another language or anything else,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   but you're going to have to use words.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And assuming that you speak English like the vast majority of you do here,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   you're going to have to open your mouth.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Like, the words are going to have to come out of your mouth.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You don't open your mouth, the gospel doesn't move forward,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and it dies with us in our generation, and it's dying in our generation.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Like, I don't know if you've heard this before.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I don't know if you've had this concept before,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   but a part of why God saved you and left you here, a significant part,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   like really, really high on the list, is so that you would tell other people about him.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's like the most important, you know, to-do thing that you have.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And you're like, "Well, I'm going to love them into the kingdom,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and I'm going to build relationships with them into the kingdom,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do that."
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That's all fine and good, but at some point, you're going to have to open your mouth.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Right? This is how the gospel moves.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It's a story.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And if you want people to know a story, it's a true story.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   If you want people to know it, you have to share it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And when you share the gospel, you participate with the power of God.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   This is Romans 1:16, written by Paul to the church, the believers in Rome.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel."
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Sometimes we're ashamed of the gospel.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   that brings salvation to everyone who believes.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   to bring salvation to everyone who believes."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So the theme of this conference is the rehearsal,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   that we're training for heaven,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   that one day we're going to stand before the Lamb of God,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and we're going to sing, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   who was and is, and is to come."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Worthy, worthy. We're going to sing this in this powerful way
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And right now, I want to talk to you about recruiting for the choir.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That we would go out of this place,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   you'd return to your respective towns and communities,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   and that we would recruit for that choir,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   so that when we get up there, it's powerful.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   People have their mouths open, and they're singing to God.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   The why this is important, it's heavy.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Trigger warning on this.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Every soul you know, every person you've ever met,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   in the grocery store, in college, your Uber driver,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   rode an elevator with them,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   they taught you sixth grade math.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Your parents, your siblings, your cousins, your neighbors,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   every soul will be in one of two places for eternity one day.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And I don't know why,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   but God chose to make a difference through us.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Like, we are how he wants to move that message forward.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That we would carry it forward by sharing the good news.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And so, I want to talk with you about the what, the why, and the how
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   of recruiting the most powerful force you have ever heard,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   you have ever seen, the most powerful force
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   that this world has ever known,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   that we would add to our numbers and experience the power of God.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I'm going to be in Matthew 16, if you have your Bibles,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and you want to turn there, and I'll jump forward in just a bit to Matthew 28.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Matthew 16, pretty awesome scene, because Jesus' boys,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   they're hanging out in Caesarea Philippi, and he walks up on them,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and he's going to ask them a question, and they're going to answer his question,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and then he's going to make a statement.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And I want to examine this statement,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and the implications of this statement for us today.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   He says this, he comes up on them.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   'Who do people say the Son of Man is?'"
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   He's saying, "Who do they say I am?"
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "And they replied, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'"
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Hmm, what about you?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   "He asked his disciples, 'Who do you say I am?'"
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   "And Simon Peter answered."
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Like, if you know anything about Peter,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   you're like, "Would you just keep your mouth shut?"
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   You know, open mouth, insert foot.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But here he goes, says, "Simon Peter answered,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.'"
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Crushed it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Nailed it.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Jesus replied, 'Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.'"
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   The gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Here's the scene. I've been right where they were standing.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Like, my wife and I, we visited this area
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   where there's this huge water kind of bursting forth out of the cave,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   and it was a place of worship.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It's where everyone would go to worship Zeus and the many Greek gods of that time,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and they would build these shrines and temples.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   They're still there, carved into the hillside to this day.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   So there the disciples are standing in front of all these little G gods,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   all these little G gods that all of the people around them are worshiping,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and Jesus, the King of kings, walks up on the scene.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   for all things were created by him and for him.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   There's not a square inch over all of creation
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   that Jesus does not hover over and cry out, "Mine!"
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And he walks up.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He says, "Hey, who do they say I am?"
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   still others Jeremiah, one of the prophets.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   "What about you? Who do you say I am?" "You're the Christ."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   "We know who you are. We've seen your stuff.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Been doing all kinds of magic. You're the Christ,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   the Son of the living God." "That's right.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   That's right, Peter. Finally. Finally."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And on this declaration that I am the Christ, the Son of the living God,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I'm going to build this unstoppable force,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and nothing in all of creation will not hold it back.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   The gates of Hades cannot keep souls back from saints who faithfully share.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   When the saints share the truth that you shared of who I am,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   we are going to break chains,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and people that Satan has his grips deep in them will be released
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   to be with us for eternity, forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Now this had to really confuse them,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   because they're like, "Wait, what?"
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Like, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Unstoppable force?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Man, that's--here's the deal, man.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Jesus, you have done some cool things, right?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Like the whole water and the wine, man, that was neat and helpful at times.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Man, I got to tell you, like the way that the guy that he couldn't walk
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and you were like, "Get up," and then he did, that was pretty amazing.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And that walking on water thing, bro, that was some David Blaine madness.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Like I'm like, "What in the world?" That was really cool.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Like, "You got to teach me that one, Jesus."
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   But you're talking about building some unstoppable force
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   that the gates of Hades can't stop?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And like you're going to build a church?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Jesus, I don't know if you realize, like the church people,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   they don't really like you.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   We overheard them talking about crucifixion, you know, and it's like, man.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And I don't know, Jesus, I don't know if you realize,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   but there's only 12 of us, and we're not even so sure about Judas, man.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   He might be playing for the other team, you know?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And we're just out here, and you're talking about,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   "Oh, I'm going to build some unstoppable force."
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   The word there is ecclesia.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It's the first time it shows up, "I'm going to build my church, my ecclesia."
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And it's translated church, but the word is really assembly.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It would best describe a military platoon,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   a group of people at war that they gather together.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   They come together to go and do a mission.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   He says, "I'm going to gather my people and send them,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   and nothing in all of creation is going to stop them."
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Want to play?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   You want to have some fun?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You want to do work?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Let's go, right?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   This is what he's saying here.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And it's my favorite prophecy in all of the Scripture, right?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Because he tells this to 12 guys, right?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And they're, like, scratching their heads, like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Fast forward the tape a couple thousand years, and look at us.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Look around.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It's Labor Day, man.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It's like take a day off of work, you know, like,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   go sit by the lake, and whatever you do, grill out, whatnot.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Look at us.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Tell me that that prophecy was not fulfilled in you,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   that billions of people gather in his name.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Like, that's what happened.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   That's what the Holy Spirit did.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Like, what Jesus said to these 12 guys came true.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   You know why?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Because they told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told you.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Now, what are you doing with it?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   You got the baton.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   The relay was passed to you, right?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   But when that baton drops,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   it stops with you, right?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So what?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   What are we sharing?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   What, my first point, what?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Tell people who Jesus is.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Who do they say I am?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   You have to tell people who Jesus is.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   To do this, you have to open your mouth, and you have to use words.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Listen, the Dalai Lama said that Jesus was the greatest man that has ever lived.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Gandhi said he would have been a Christian had he ever met one.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Mohammed, the leader of the Islamic faith, said that Jesus was of the greatest prophets.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But Jesus said about himself that he is Lord, that he is God, that he is the Son of God, the Son of Man,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   the one who was there in the beginning.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And so C.S. Lewis presents this argument, Lord, liar, lunatic.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He says, "Hey, was he a liar, someone who claimed to be God, but he wasn't?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Was he a madman, a lunatic, someone who thought he was God, but he wasn't?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Or is he who he says he is, Lord of the creation of heavens and earth?"
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And I'm telling you, Jesus leaves you no room, no option to say, "Well, he was just a good man.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He was just a great teacher. He was just a really cool magician in history."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   No, he was God. He was God.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And so if you are his follower, then you share his story, the gospel.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Every Friday, I get questions from around the world.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And a lot of them are, "Hey, how do I share the gospel with my mom?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   How do I share the gospel with my lost friend?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   How do I share the gospel with my roommate who's sleeping with her boyfriend?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   How do I share the gospel with my Muslim friend?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   How do I share the gospel with a Mormon?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   How do I share the gospel with somebody who thinks they're a Christian, but they're not?"
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The way you share the gospel with anyone, anywhere, at any time, in any place, is you share the gospel.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You just share the gospel.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   In 1 Corinthians 15, it says this, "Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel."
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Okay, cool. What's the gospel? He's going to remind us.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's good news.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   "For what I have received I passed on to you as of first importance,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   that Christ died for your sins according to the Scriptures,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   that he was buried and he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   He goes on to say, "He appeared to 500 people, many of whom are still alive. Go, ask them."
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So you share the gospel by saying, "Jesus Christ has died for your sins.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   He went in the grave for three days, and on the third day he rose from the dead."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   That's the good news. You don't have to die for your sins, because Jesus has already died for your sins.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   If you trust in his payment that he died for your sins, you get to live forever and ever with him.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Theologians call it the great exchange.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   He got what you deserve, and if you trust that he got what you deserve, then you get what he deserves.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You become an heir to a kingdom forever and ever and ever,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   having nothing to do with your works and everything to do with having you trusted in Jesus.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The only way someone will trust in Jesus is if you tell them.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Well, how will they know unless you tell them? That's Romans 10.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   You have to tell them.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   So how do you share the gospel with a Mormon, with a Muslim, with an atheist,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   with a teacher, with a parent, with a sister, with a neighbor?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You share the gospel.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And you're like, "But wait, wait, that doesn't work."
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   You don't work, period.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It has nothing to do with what you do, and everything to do with what God does with what you did.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   God, the Holy Spirit, has to intersect with your words and breathe life into their hearts.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Otherwise, it doesn't work.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   That means for you, faithfulness is sharing.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   You're not in charge of the outcome.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   You just share faithfully.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   God is in charge of the outcome.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   You just speak the words.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   You leave, and you pray and say, "All right, God, I did my part. Now it's your turn."
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   God's not going to disappoint you.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Like you rely on Him.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   His plan is perfect. You can trust it.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You pray like it's not up to you because it's not up to you.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   So at that point, when you share, you did your faithful part.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And now you say, "Okay, God, I'm going to trust you with the outcome."
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   People tell me all the time, "Oh, man, I shared the gospel with so-and-so."
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I'm like, "What did you say?"
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "Oh, you know, I invited him to church."
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   "Cool, when did you share the gospel?"
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   "I brought him, I'm going to bring him to church, man."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   "Oh, but you didn't share the gospel."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   "I mean, I'll share the gospel with him, but you didn't share the gospel with him."
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   "You invited him to church."
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   To share the gospel is talking about the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   If you're not talking about the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   you're not sharing the gospel.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Jesus is the way. They're trying to get to heaven.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one gets to the Father except through me."
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It's John 14, 6.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   "What about so-and-so? What about this? And how? Don't all ways lead to God?"
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   No, if all ways lead to God, then his son didn't need to die.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   If there was any other way, his son didn't need to die.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   If I'm in an airport… I just got back from Zambia a couple of weeks ago.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   If I'm there, and I'm in the airport, and I'm lost, and I just want to get home to see my family.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I'm really far from my family, and I'm trying to figure out how to navigate this airport,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and everybody there doesn't speak the language.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So I'm kind of having this nervous breakdown in the airport of which gate is going to take me home.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And you come up to me. You walk up to me.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   You see me like, "Oh, JP, man, with the porch. Yeah, Harris Creek. Okay, yeah, Wacon."
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   "Hey, listen. Listen. What's wrong? I see you're distressed."
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I'm like, "Man, I'm just trying to get home. I want to see my family. I've been here for 10 days.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I'm homesick. I want to get home. I don't know which gate's going to take me home."
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And you say, "Oh, man, I've got good news for you. Any one of these gates will take you home.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Just jump on a plane."
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And I get on a plane, and it takes me to Ukraine,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   or it takes me further from home, or I get off, and I'm dodging bullets in some war-torn country.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   See, what you said to me, it felt really loving, and I responded with lots of gratitude,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   but it was unloving because it wasn't true.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And it got me further from where I need to be.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   So you've got to share the gospel. Jesus is the way.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   You have to tell them about Jesus. There's no other way.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   And so why? My second point is why?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Because God has invited you to.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's not that He needs you to.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   He doesn't need you to. He tells us, "Hey, I can make the rocks cry out.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I can use anything. I can speak to a donkey.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I've chosen you to. I want to have fun.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   I've left you there. I saved you, and I didn't just take you home.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I've left you there to be on mission with me."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It's humbling when you realize God doesn't need you, but He chooses to use you.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   That's a really fun place to be.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Like, "Oh, yeah. It's not all up to me."
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   You don't have to saddle up with the responsibility of, "Oh, no, I have to go out there and save people."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   No, you have to go out there and share with people.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   God's the one that saves.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I was in Africa a different time.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   People always say, "Well, what about the Bushmen in Africa who never hears the gospel?"
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   We always pick on Africa for some reason.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   There's no Bibles there or something, but there's amazing followers of Jesus all over the continent.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   But I'm there, and I am literally in the jungle.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm sitting on this bench in the jungle. True story.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   This woman walks up to me, big, bright smile.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   She says, "Oh, hey. How are you?" in a thick accent.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   She speaks English.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I said, "I'm good. How are you?"
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   She said, "Are you saved?"
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Second question she asked me, "Are you saved?"
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I was like, "Man, what do you mean by saved?"
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "Jesus! Do you know Jesus?"
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I said, "Yeah. In fact, I am saved. I do know Jesus."
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I said, "How did you come to know Jesus?"
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   She said, "Oh," and she tells me the story.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   I'll drop the accent for clarity.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   She tells me the story.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   She says, "God has always spoken to me in my dreams."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   She said, "One day, He introduced me to His Son and told me that He died for me so that I could be with Him forever."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I said, "Man, that's really great."
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I said, "So a missionary came here and shared the gospel, and then you had a dream about it."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   She looked at me confused. She goes, "No missionary came here."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   I said, "I'm skeptical. I'm leaning in."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I said, "Well, how did you know His name was Jesus?"
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   She said, "That was His name in my dream."
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I said, "All right. I'm good. I'm convinced. I'm good, right?"
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Listen. Hit the pressure release valve.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   God doesn't need you. He chooses to use you.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Another time, I had the privilege of being on this show that's broadcasted into Iran.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Iran's a closed country.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Christians can't go there legally to share the gospel, but they can send in a satellite signal to the TV.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   They say the national flower of Iran is the satellite dish because every house has a satellite dish you can broadcast into.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   I go on this TV show that's being broadcasted into Iran, and I'm sharing my story.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   In my story, I'm sharing the gospel.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Then they take callers.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   This 12-year-old girl calls in.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   She starts speaking in Farsi, but I have an earpiece, and they're interpreting for me in my earpiece.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   She starts speaking in Farsi, all ecstatic.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I can tell everyone's excited. I'm lost. The camera's on me.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I'm like, "Ha ha ha. What's going on?"
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   They tell me, "She had a dream about the man you're talking about last night."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Then I got to ask questions.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Sure enough, the night before, she had a dream.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   In the Quran, Jesus is Isa.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Isa is actually Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, who died for your sins and God raised Him from the dead.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   God communicated that to her in the dream the night before.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Now she's watching the show.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   She places her faith in Jesus, which means she, at 12, is getting kicked out of her house.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   This isn't like, "Look at me. I'm looking for attention."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   This is like, "My whole world just got rocked because I'm choosing to follow that man, Jesus Christ."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   God doesn't need you.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   He chooses to use you to recruit His choir.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   The way that you do that is you open your mouth.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So why don't we share?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Why don't we share?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   What did you say?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   We're selfish.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Fear of rejection is not going to go well.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   It might swing on us or something.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Pride.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   We're too busy.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   There's a lot coming in.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   We have a lot of reasons that we don't share.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   We can fill this room with all kinds of reasons of, "Here's why we don't share, JP.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Here's why we don't share God."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   We can whittle them down.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   You might be like, "I don't know how. We're going to talk about that."
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   But listen, I think if you boiled all of them down,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   the very truest, most honest answer that you don't share,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   it's awkward.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Could you imagine you get to heaven,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Peter welcomes you in.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "Hey, welcome, Jesus."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Oh my goodness, you worship him for a couple billion years, you know.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And then you meet Paul.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   "I'm not ashamed of the gospel, Paul.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   There's a power of God, right, Paul.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   To live is Christ, to die is game, Paul.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   What's up, Paul? How you doing?"
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Man, wasn't that awesome down there?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   How great was it down there?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   We just got to go everywhere and tell people about Jesus.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Wasn't that amazing?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   "Oh yeah, man, you did a great job."
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   "Yeah, but you did, right? I mean, bro, what is so much fun?"
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   "Yeah, you know, not so much, you know.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   There was that one time, there was this one time for this mission trip,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   like I had to, and he's like,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   'No, like every day you didn't go share the gospel, why not?'
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I'm like, 'Man, I don't know, Paul. You know, it was...
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It was...
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   It was, man, it was...
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It was awkward.'"
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And he's like, "Awkward? Is that Greek or Hebrew? Awkward.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Is it Aramaic? Awkward, awkward."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   "Oh, awkward, oh yes.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Yes, they'll put you in prison.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Yeah, no, that happened to me and Peter.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Me and Pete were laid up in the prison, man, singing our way out of there.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I know what you mean, awkward."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   "No, no, Paul, not prison."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   He's like, "Oh, the stocks, the thing, the head, yeah.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Man, that is awkward, 'cause you're all like contorted."
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   He's like, "Man, it's awkward, bro, I get it, man."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   He's like, "No, there wasn't really a lot of stocks,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   like stock market, but not that."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And then he's just like confused.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   "Oh, the 40 lashes minus one, that hurt. It was awkward.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Yeah, man, 'cause it was like tore my flesh from my back.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Gosh, I get it. I understand why you didn't share,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   'cause that was really painful."
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   He's like, "No, there wasn't.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   There was no 40 lashes minus one, not even two lashes,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   not even a lash, Paul."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He's like, "Oh, oh, man, was it the lions?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   They came after you with the lions."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And you're like, "No, Paul, there was no lions.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I'm actually an otter, Enneagram six, introvert,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   and it just is not comfortable for me.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   People were gonna think I'm weird."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   You know, it's tough.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   That's like a little bit of a reality check for us,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   'cause I've been reading, you know,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   and it seems like we're just supposed to go everywhere
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and tell everyone.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And like this is one of those things you can't do in heaven.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   So we get to recruit here, but we're not rehearsing.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   We're recruiting,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   because you can't share the gospel in heaven.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   There's no one in heaven that is not fully aware
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   of who Jesus is and what he's done.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   So now's your shot.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Now is your chance.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   In Matthew 28,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Jesus gathers with those same guys in Matthew 16.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Right? Same guys.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Like what happened in, like, right there toward the end,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   you know, Jesus says, "I'm gonna go die for you."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And Peter's like, "No, you're not."
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And Jesus is like, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   You know, it's like, it's the same dude.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   He was like, "Yeah, that's my boy."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And now he's like, "Satan."
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And then Peter, you know, like he's so scared.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   He denies him to a 12-year-old, you know.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   He's like, "I don't know him."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And she's like, "Yeah, you do. I saw you with him."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   "No, I don't. Stop saying that."
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He starts cussing, you know, like he's cool.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Matthew 28.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And then Jesus came to them and said,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Man.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   "Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And surely I am with you always,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   to the very end of the age."
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Father, we need your help to understand.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   If that was for us, or just for them,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and what we're to do with that,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   would you show us now, in Jesus' name?
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Amen.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   These guys, one of them was a total traitor, right?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   One of them denied Jesus, his closest friend,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   and hurt him in one of the deepest,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   betraying kind of ways.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Total cowards.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Rejects from the community.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   No rabbi had taken them under their wing,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   and so they're just kind of left to flounder and to fish
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and to gather taxes, and Jesus says, "Come and follow me."
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And they're very much two steps forward, one step back kind of guys.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Like they just constantly mess it up.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   And then something happens.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   So what happened between Matthew 16 and Matthew 28?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   What happened?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Jesus died on a cross and raised from the dead.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So there's something that these guys are seeing.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   The Holy Spirit comes upon them with power,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   and they're like, "Oh, we're not talking about walking on water anymore.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   We're not talking about healing the sick or the lame, the blind, the deaf, the mute.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   We're not talking about five loaves and fish anymore.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   We're talking about raising from the dead."
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And all of a sudden, these cowards become incredibly courageous.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And every single one of them, except for one of them,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   gives their life for Jesus.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I'm talking beheaded, sawed in two, crucified upside down, boiled alive.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   James, Jesus' brother, they take him up to the top of the temple.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   They hold him over and say, "Hey, stop saying that he was God.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Stop saying that he was God."
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   He's like, "Hey, bro, I can't. He was God."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Throw him off the temple.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Boom, he hits the ground.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   They crawl down.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   They stand up over him. He's still breathing.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "Stop saying he's God."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   "I can't. He is God."
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And they begin to hit him with clubs until he stops breathing.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   What happened to those guys who denied Jesus to everyone
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   because it's awkward, and all of a sudden,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   they are turned into some of the greatest missionaries this world has ever known?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   They believed it.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   They believed it.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   They saw it with their own eyes.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   The resurrected Lord.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   He defeated death. What are we afraid of?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   What are you going to do, kill us?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   We'll get to be with him.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Let's get this show on the road, man.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Do what you've got to do. Pick up your rocks.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I'll be your target.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   By the way, Jesus died for your sins. God raised him from the dead.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   That's what they would do. They just take those opportunities to share the gospel.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "Oh, you're going to hit me with some rods? Okay.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   By the way, Jesus died for your sins. God raised him from the dead."
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "Oh, get the saw."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "By the way, Jesus died for your sins. God raised him from the dead."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   "The same Spirit that raised him from the dead lives in me."
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   "He can live in you. You won him. I'm recruiting."
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   "I'm about to go meet him. Come with me if you want."
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   "It's available to you."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   So how? How do we share this gospel?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   You must believe this gospel.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Our belief always follows our behavior.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   The other day, I'm with my friend.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   He's planted all these trees. He's all proud of them.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   We're somewhere else, a little bit more tropical than this place.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   He's showing me these lime trees.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   He was like, "Hey, this is a lime tree. It makes limes."
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I was like, "That's really redundant."
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   But this is what we do in the church.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   We say, "We want to be a church that makes disciples who make disciples."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "We want to be a church that makes disciples."
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   The essence of being a disciple is making disciples.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   The way you know that someone is a disciple is because you look and see that they have disciples around them
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   who are following Jesus with them.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   This is what it means to be a disciple.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   So as redundant as that's a lime tree that makes limes,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   is a disciple who makes disciples.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   There's no other kind of disciple.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Followers of Jesus tell people about Jesus and show people the way.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   These guys got it, and they gave their life for a mission.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   God is inviting you to have fun with Him.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Hey, you see that girl?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   She cuts herself when she's all by herself.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   She's releasing the pain, some trauma that happened to her when she was young.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And so when she's all alone, she inflicts herself with wounds so that she feels.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And I'm going to save her.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   You want to have some fun?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You see that guy?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   He's got a Glock 9mm at home that he keeps away, hidden under his bed,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and he's going to use it to end it all because the enemy has just had his way with him.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   But I'm going to save him.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   You want to have some fun?
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   You see that guy?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Oh yeah, he's big dog corporate America, driving the Aston Martin,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   and living in the penthouse, and living for this world, and he's going to die in the world.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Except I'm going to save him, and I would love to use you.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   You want to have some fun?
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   She had an abortion, swore she's never going to tell anyone.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Take it to her grave.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   It's rotting her from the inside out.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   She's a shell of a person in her insecurities.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   But I'm going to take her mess and make it her message, and even her ministry.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Do you want to play?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   You want to have some fun?
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Let's do work.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   God is inviting you to partner with him to save people.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And the way you do it, your part in it, is you share the gospel.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Jesus Christ has died for your sins.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   You don't have to pay for your sins.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   God has raised him from the dead.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   That same spirit that raised him from the dead is available to live inside of you.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   How? How do we do it?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Here's what I think is the hardest part.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   The transition.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   You get the transition, it's all downhill from there.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Hardest part is the transition.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   How do we go from talking about the cowboys to talking about Jesus?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   How do we do that?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   "Oh, he threw a Hail Mary. That was Jesus' mom."
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   You know how not to do it.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   "It's really hot out here." "Hell is hot too."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   No, don't do it like that.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I'm going to give you two ways. Super effective.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Take this with you. It's not awkward.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   It may be even a tiny bit awkward.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I don't want to oversell you on this.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Here are the two questions. Are you ready?
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Hey, are you in a church?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Are you in a church at all?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Do you see this? Natural.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   We're talking about wings, chicken wings.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   "Hey, how long have you lived here? Oh, you're a server. That's cool."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Hey, are you in a church at all? Now we're there.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   We're talking about things of faith.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Are you in a church at all?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Not awkward.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "No, I just came back from this conference in Dallas."
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Are you in a church at all?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Super easy. I'll give you another one.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   That's one. You take that one if you want.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I use them interchangeably. Here's another one.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   "Hey, so do you have a faith?"
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   A what? A lot of times they're like, "A face?"
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   I'm like, "No, I see you have a face."
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Truly, that happens a lot.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   A faith, like a religion, a spirituality, a belief system.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Those two questions. Are you in a church?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Do you have a faith?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Either of those questions is going to get you talking about spiritual things.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And then what I do is this.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   I didn't make it up. Evangelism Explosion. The Kennedy questions.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   James D. Kennedy came up with these two questions.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   I find them really effective.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   He said, "Let me ask you a question.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Between one and ten, ten being certain, one being not so sure,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   if you died today, how certain are you that you would go to heaven?"
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And they'll say something, like a seven.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   And you say, "Okay, if you stood before God and he said, 'Why should I let you in?'
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   what would you say?"
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And they'll say something. A lot of times it's something other than Jesus.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   "Well, because I tried hard."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   The other day I was sharing the gospel.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I was going to buy a car, so my side hustle is I buy and sell cars.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And it's like my hobby.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   People watch sports. I watch Craigslist.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   And so I'm going to buy this car, and this 76-year-old man is selling it.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And I'm like, I ask my kids, "Hey, y'all want to come?"
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   They're like, "No, Dad, we don't want to go see you buy another car.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   We're just going to stay here and play on our phones."
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And I'm like, "No, y'all come in. Let's go make a memory."
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And so we go, and we drive to a city close by.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And a 76-year-old man, Otis, he's there.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   He's selling his car, and I'm talking to him.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And I'm like, "Hey, Otis, do you have a faith?"
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   He's like, "Oh, yeah, I'm a Christian. Sure, I've got a faith."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I said, "Awesome. Between one and ten, ten being certain, one being not so sure.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   If you died today, how certain are you that you would go to heaven?"
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   And he said, "Oh, I'm a ten."
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I said, "Man, that's awesome. Praise God.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   You stood before God, and he said, 'Why should I let you in? What would you say?'"
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And he said, "Because every single week I save a puppy."
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And I was like, "Man, that's really sweet. I wouldn't tell God that, though."
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Like, this is why you're trying to earn your way in through the puppies, huh?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And so we just got to clarify. I was like, "Otis, that's interesting."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Because Jesus, he didn't have to die on the cross.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   You could have just saved a bunch of puppies, SPCA out here, right?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   That's not how it works. You see, this is my son.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And if I let my son die for you, and then you tell me, "Oh, he didn't need to die.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   I could have just went to the pound," right?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   There are some issues with that.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And I'm just logically talking to him about what he's saying to me.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   And you know what happened? This 76-year-old man, right?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   He goes from death to life. My children are there, right?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   We get in the car, and they're like, "Dad, that was awesome."
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   They didn't even want to go, you know?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   But they got to experience someone who doesn't have a lot of life left on the earth.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   You know, he's lived 76 years.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And in his 76th year, he comes to a place, and he's like, "Oh, yeah. Jesus, I get it now. I'm in.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I'm at the gym the next day, and I bump into a dude. He's just down."
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   I'm like, "Hey, man, everything okay?" "Yeah, it's fine."
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I was like, "Man, it doesn't seem like fine. What's going on?"
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   "Ah, man, just rough week." "Yeah, tell me about it."
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   He doesn't want to tell me about it, but I'm nosy, you know?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   So I'm like, "How was it rough?"
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   He's like, "Oh, man, my girl, you know, just she ended things. Man, I'm sorry."
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   I said, "You got some people around you, you know? You in the church at all?"
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   He's like, "Ah, man, I used to be. I used to be. I was once upon a time. Not really. Not anymore."
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   I was like, "Oh, man. Well, I'd love to talk to you more about that. Would you care if I asked you two questions?"
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   "Oh, what's up? I mean, you're already asking me lots of questions. What's up?"
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   "Between one and ten. Ten being certain, one being not so sure.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   If you died today, how certain are you that you would go to heaven?"
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   He says, "I'm a one."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   I said, "Oh, man."
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And listen, a one and a nine is all the same, by the way.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   You're not sure. You're not sure because of Jesus.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   And he says, "I'm a one."
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   And I say, "Okay, you stood before God."
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   He says, "Why should I let you in? What did you say?"
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   He's like, "I wouldn't have anything to say."
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And I said, "You know what? You're closer to the kingdom of heaven than a lot of church people."
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   You know? That's the reality.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Because you're at this place where you've got nothing to offer God, and that's true for everyone.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   You just know it.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And you're at this place where you realize there's nothing that you've done that's going to get you in.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   And that's true for everyone. You just realize it.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And I said, "The way that we get in is because of what Jesus did."
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   I told him, I said, "Listen, if I give you tickets to the Cowboys game, right?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   AT&T Stadium, 50-yard line, great seats. I give you two tickets.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And you drive over there to the Cowboys game, and you try to get in, and they stop you.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   They say, 'Why should we let you in? What are you going to say?'"
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And he said, "I'm going to say it because I have tickets."
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   And if they say, "Did you pay for the tickets? What are you going to say?"
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   He said, "No, I'm going to say they were a gift."
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   And I said, "Now you get it, bro. That's how you get into heaven. It's a gift."
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith. It's not of yourself. It's the gift of God.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Not by works so that no one can boast." That's Ephesians 2, 8, 9.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   The way you're going to get into heaven is because of the gift of God, right?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Working alongside the power of God, the gospel.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   The way people get into heaven is you open your mouth, and you share the gospel.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   The Holy Spirit intersects with your words, and they respond to the gospel.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   And that's how you get in. That's how that works.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Who else are you going to boast in? Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And no one gets to the Father except through Him.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   He's the ticket, and you did nothing to earn that ticket.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   God gave it to you as a gift.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Grace. We have to get our heads and our hearts around that reality.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   And so what? Tell people who Jesus is.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Why? Because God has invited you to.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   How? Out of your own belief, you open your mouth, and you share Jesus.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   My dad died in 2020.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Family's hard.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   You know, family's hard.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And I remember before he died, sitting on the couch.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   You know, he knows what I do for a living, you know.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   And I was like, uh, he was asking me about something at the church.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   And I was like, "Yeah, you know, we were actually asking a bunch of people two questions these days, Dad.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Do you mind if I ask you?"
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   That's awkward.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   You know, it's tough.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Yeah, between one and ten. Ten being certain, one being not so sure.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   If you died today, he said, "I'm a seven."
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   So you stood before God, and he said, "Why should I let you in? What would you say?"
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   He said, "I've been to church my whole life.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Because I, because I've done this, because I went here, because of the sacraments, because..."
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   I said, "Yeah, man, it's interesting, Dad, because, you know, I've started reading this book a lot, you know, now that I'm teaching it and all."
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   And it says something different.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Would you mind if I shared it with you?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Do you know how thrilled I am today that we had that conversation?
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   You know?
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Like how over the top excited I am.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   You know why I'm so passionate?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   You know why I yelled a lot, and I'm all sweating up here like a pig over the past hour?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Where the passion comes from is this is, I benefited from this.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Like I'm going to be with God forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Like some of you, you're like, you've got big questions for God.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Like why evil? And why cancer? And why did they break up? And why this pain? And why my parents?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   You know, I've got a big question for God.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   You don't know what it is? Why me?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Why would you save me?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Like of all of the people in the world, why would you choose me?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Why would you allow me to take this message and carry it forward?
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Why would you give me that privilege?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   But you've got to leave here, and you've got to open your mouth.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   All right, it's participation time. Everybody get to pop rocks.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Okay, don't eat them. Let's follow instructions really close here.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Okay, really close.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   Listen, listen, listen to me. Everybody listen to me. Listen, listen, listen.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Grab it by the top like this. Grab it one hand by the top.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   And yeah, just shake it like that. You guys have done it before. You're pros.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Okay, stop shaking it.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Okay, you're not listening. This is like Simon says, okay.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Stop shaking it. I'm going to say that again because I'm going to see you right there.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Not, you're just like, "What did he say?"
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   I said stop shaking it. Okay, hold it good like this. Ready?
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   The thing, the way that this works is if we all do the same thing at the same time.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Okay, and so you're going to hold it here about halfway in the middle,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   and you're just going to do a really good clean rip off the top, straight across like that.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   So you should have a good piece like that.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Okay, and then what I want you to do is I want you to open it up real big like a cup.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   So you put two fingers in there, and you get it open like a cup.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   Now don't do anything yet because this is the important part.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   I am going to have you dump this in your mouth.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Okay, don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. Okay?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Because we're going to do it at the same time.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   And some of you are like, "But I'm diabetic, and I can't, and you don't understand.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   I'm allergic to Pop Rocks."
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   You can spit them out if you'd like afterwards, but I would love, like if at all possible,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   a hundred percent, you know, like, "But my shirt's so cute, and I made drool on it."
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Maybe, you know.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Okay, so you got them, right?
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   And what you're going to do is you're going to dump it.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   If you can't stomach all of them, just get a good, you know, a good half of them in your mouth.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   You're just going to put it in your mouth, but there's going to be more instructions, okay?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   So on three. One, two, three.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Okay, now close your mouth and get a lot of saliva cooking in there.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   You keep your mouth closed. Really have that, you feel that party, you know, going on?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Okay. Everybody good? You got it? Going around, moving around?
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Okay. What I want to do is this half of the room, so right here are the cameras, you guys up there too.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   This half of the room, open your mouth real big.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Yeah, yeah. Okay, close them.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Okay, we're going to go this half of the room now, okay?
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   You ready? This half of the room, open your mouth real big.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Yeah, that was great. That was great.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Okay, let's do this. Everybody open your mouth.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   For people to hear the gospel, you're going to have to open your mouth.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Wherever you go, for them to hear the gospel, you're going to have to open your mouth.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   You keep your mouth, like here's the deal, look, look, look, look.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Freddie, Freddie, you still got them in your mouth? Oh, you swallowed.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Okay, I'm going to go here, Carly. You ready? You ready?
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Okay, just you open your mouth. Everybody else, mouth closed. Just you open your mouth.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   That's not powerful. There's no power in that.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Like we go out there as recruits to bring in, right, to say, "Hey, do you want to come and share the gospel with me?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Hey, do you want to go, do you want to be with God forever and ever?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Do you want to see his kingdom come to earth?"
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   You go out there, you share the gospel. You have to open your mouth.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   You have to use words. You know why? You know why?
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Because if you don't, even the rocks will cry out, okay?
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Even the rocks will cry out. You have to share the gospel.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Everywhere you go, open your mouth, tell them, "Jesus Christ has died for your sins and God has raised him from the dead."
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   In a minute, you're going to leave. You're going to get on airplanes.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   You're going to get in Ubers. Everywhere you go, you're like, "Well, I don't know when to share."
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Okay, to keep it simple, how about every single space you occupy?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   "Well, I'm going to be the weird person on the other." Dude, that's amazing.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   You get up to heaven and you're like, "God, I was the weird person."
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   You know? He's like, "Oh, I know. I know. I know."
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Like, that's awesome. Everywhere you go, everyone you see, just share the gospel.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   And let's build the choir.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   [Applause]
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Father, the praise and the applause and the glory and the honor are yours forever and ever and ever.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   You have brought us to a place where we know you.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And the Holy Spirit that resurrected Jesus from the dead lives inside of us.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   So help us not to live with a spirit of fear and timidity, but one of power and love and self-discipline.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   So that everywhere we go, that everything we do, that the words that we share would be for the purpose of making room.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Bringing others to know you in a greater way.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   Father, we love you and we give you praise.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   And just as we sing now, I pray that it would be a commercial for what we are going to do a lot of in 100 years, in 70 years, in 50 years, for some of us 20 years.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   But that we would just do a lot of singing your praise forever and ever and ever.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   And right now, God, would you help us desire to want to make room.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
