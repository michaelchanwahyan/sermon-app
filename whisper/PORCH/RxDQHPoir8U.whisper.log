[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   I mean, he's practically dating a model.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.680]   She told me they went to Cabo, and he paid for the whole thing.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.120]   Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.400]   He proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.960]   Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.160]   and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   She's got the husband, the house.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.920]   She's got it all.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.200]   What more could you ask for?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.880]   How are we this evening?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.120]   Come on.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.960]   Well, we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.360]   I grew up on a farm in a small town in South Texas,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.800]   so about 20 acres in the middle of nowhere.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.480]   And we had this big shed.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.280]   We called it the big garage.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.840]   And as I was a child and loved to play outside and be outside
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.000]   and whatnot, the big garage was just full of toys.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.200]   And by toys, I mean like shovels and rakes and farming
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.640]   equipment, that kind of thing.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.120]   And there was this thing in there
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.200]   that I didn't know exactly what it was,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   but it instantly became a toy of mine, if you will,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120]   because it kind of looked like a gun.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.160]   And so it would make this clicking noise.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.880]   And so I would get it, and I would kind of
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.320]   go around the yard and pretend like I was shooting things.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.480]   And if a friend came over, I would give him one,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.080]   and I'd have one.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.440]   And we would play kind of armies.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.800]   I think I've got a picture of it.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.520]   There it is.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.600]   OK, so that's it.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.520]   And so that was this thing in the garage.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.160]   And so I would get it and play with it.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.080]   And so that's your kind of imagination runs.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.880]   And so you ever see something, you're like,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.360]   I wonder what that's for.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.880]   And so for me, I'm like, man, I wonder what that's for.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.320]   And so one day, I'm out with my dad,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   and we're doing cowboy farming kind of stuff,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   and not my kind of stuff, but his kind of stuff.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.720]   And so we're out there.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.960]   We're feeding the cows.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.040]   And we stop by this fence that's broken.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.440]   And he gets out that thing.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.480]   And I'm like, dad, it's a weird time to play army man.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.400]   What are you doing?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.720]   And he hooks it up to the fence.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.040]   And he begins repairing the fence.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.240]   And so this is another picture of what it is.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.920]   And so that's what it's for.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.400]   And I remember having this moment--
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.680]   this is why I tell you this weird story.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.320]   I remember having this moment that's like, oh,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   that's what that's for.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   Like, I had no idea.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.520]   I would have never in a million years
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560]   been able to fill in the blank the right way.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.720]   It was like, oh, yeah, does that ever happen to you?
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.480]   Oh, that's what that's for.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   Or like, you're doing something with something.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   And you're like, that's not what that's for.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.720]   I'll go one more with you, because you guys
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   didn't seem to jump on board with the fence stretcher.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.000]   So let me go here.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.880]   My son Weston comes in--
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.840]   about a year ago, he comes in the room.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.240]   And he's wearing Monica's bra on his head.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.040]   And he's like, earmuffs.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.800]   And I'm like, no, that's not what that's for.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.880]   And I can't even show you what that's for, OK?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.960]   So we'll just talk about it.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.000]   So it's like there's something that serves a purpose.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.720]   And you think that it serves a very different purpose.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.240]   And the reason I start there as we wrap up relationship goals
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   is because tonight, I hope that happens three times.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.200]   I hope three times tonight you go, oh, that's what that's for.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.120]   I thought that it was just a toy for my amusement.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.260]   I thought that it was just something for me
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.040]   to engage my emotions on.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.480]   I thought that it was just a good time.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.840]   Oh, that's what that's for.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.320]   As we talk about singleness, being single,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.200]   dating, and marriage, I hope three times tonight you go,
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.760]   oh, that's what that's for.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.360]   We have to return to the purpose of these things--
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   being single, dating, and marriage.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.080]   Because God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   the one who formed you in your mother's womb,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.480]   the one who created all things as we know it and see it
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   and live in it, has a purpose for singleness,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.320]   and dating, and marriage.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.440]   And you would be infinitely better pursuing
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.640]   his purpose than your own purpose, or the world's
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.600]   purpose, or culture's purpose.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.980]   Because you've got to understand we're not getting better
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.360]   at this.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.600]   So the divorce rate right now is about 50%,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   depending on what stat you read.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.740]   Somewhere it's hovering around 50%.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.520]   That means about half of marriages fail miserably.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.640]   Half of people who says, I--
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.240]   for richer or poorer in sickness and health
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.400]   until death do us part, part before death.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.080]   About 50%.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.160]   And we're not getting better at this.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.680]   In fact, somebody after a couple weeks ago called in.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.880]   They wanted to talk to David.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.840]   They were upset.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.500]   Said they wouldn't be back to the porch
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.440]   because we talked about this idea of cohabitating,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.020]   living together before you're married.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.840]   Said I'm committed to it.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.800]   Well, let me share with you why a loving pastor would
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   tell you not to.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.200]   I'll give you some stats.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.660]   Greater than 60% of cohabitating couples who live together
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.140]   do not get married.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.260]   Greater than 75% of cohabitating couples who get married
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.140]   get a divorce.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.820]   What that means is 10 out of 100 couples
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.420]   who cohabitated before marriage actually stay married.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.140]   10 out of 100.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.460]   And so a loving pastor and a loving God
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.740]   would say you would be crazy to stack the odds against you
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.100]   by doing-- and we said, well, no.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.740]   Isn't it going to be a better marriage?
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.500]   No, statistically, absolutely not.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.540]   And when we talk about a divorce rate of like 50%,
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.100]   for example, that does not account for those
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.260]   who are miserably married.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.220]   So a successful marriage rate is much lower than 50%.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.600]   We're not getting better at this.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.380]   We're getting married later.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.940]   On average, seven years later than in the 1960s.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.140]   Just a generation ago.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.820]   We're getting married seven years later.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.500]   What happens 50 years from now?
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.740]   Seven years later and 50 years from there?
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.140]   Seven years later?
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.100]   Pretty soon we're getting married past the age
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.580]   that people can have children.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.100]   Did you know that nearly half of girls
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.460]   who have children in their 20s are unmarried?
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.500]   We're not getting better at this.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.220]   Seems like we've got to return to the purpose.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.340]   But what about if we do it God's way?
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.340]   Another stat for you, Protestant Christian couples
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.500]   actively involved in their faith are 35% less likely to divorce.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.180]   35% less likely to divorce than the general population.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.460]   93%, that's 93 out of 100 couples who independently
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.660]   said that God is at the center of their marriage,
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.700]   rated their marriage happy or very happy.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.140]   See, it seems to me that we forgot that we were created
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.900]   by God for God to serve a purpose for God.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.220]   And if you had a Bible on a deserted island
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.060]   and you began reading it and you said,
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.340]   you know, I think this is kind of like God
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.420]   has some things for me.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.420]   I want to understand how he wants me to date and pursue
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.220]   relationships.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.220]   He's a relational God.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.460]   So I'm just going to read this like I'm
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.780]   reading it for the first time.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.780]   I think that you're going to walk away
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.620]   from that time on that deserted island
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.500]   with a very different worldview of marriage, dating,
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.380]   and singleness.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.900]   I think you're going to say, oh, that's what that's for.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.300]   I need to do that really, really different than I'm
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.500]   doing that right now.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.100]   And so tonight, as we wind down relationship goals,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.700]   we're going to talk about the purpose of singleness,
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.380]   the purpose of marriage, and the purpose of dating
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.260]   and how it is very, very different than what you thought
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.420]   when you came in this evening.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.540]   And so I want to show you that singleness is not
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.060]   what you think, that dating is not what you think.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.700]   And before you leave here this evening,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.580]   that marriage is very different than what you think.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.140]   Monica and I do premarried couples, premarried counseling.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.780]   And so I've been in ministry for a decade now.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.260]   I've done about 40 weddings.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.020]   And by the grace of God, all 40 of those couples
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.220]   are still married today.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.620]   And as we talk to them, all 40 of them,
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.980]   as they sat in our living room, all 40 of them,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.940]   without exception, have had crazy expectations
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.820]   around marriages, marriage that we've had to correct.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.980]   And they've all come back and said, man, you were so right.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.580]   We had these rose-colored glasses.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.380]   We had no idea what this would be like.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.780]   And so I want to help you this evening.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.260]   We're going to be in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.100]   if you want to turn there.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.540]   1 Corinthians chapter seven, written by the apostle Paul
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.540]   to the church in Corinth about 56 AD.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.140]   The church is under great persecution.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.100]   He's using language like, hey, Jesus is returning soon.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.060]   You don't have long.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.260]   There's a sense of urgency to this letter.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.060]   Nero is about to show up on the scene, the emperor Nero,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.420]   and he is about to persecute Christians for sport.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.020]   He'll stitch animal skin to them, unleash dogs on them
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.760]   so they can be ripped apart for the amusement of others.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.940]   And Paul writes to this church saying,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.580]   hey, get ready, troubles are coming,
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.180]   and you need to understand,
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.700]   you need to have a right perspective about singleness.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.760]   And he's going to talk about the betrothal period,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.100]   which is being engaged, which is the closest we have
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.340]   to dating in the scriptures and marriage.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.260]   You need to have a right perspective of these.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.300]   Very applicable for them then,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.940]   very applicable for us tonight,
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.500]   because we are moving in a culture facing persecution
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.700]   for being a Christian.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.900]   Christian values, a biblical worldview,
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.820]   is increasingly unpopular.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.060]   So this is a very applicable chapter for us this evening.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.240]   One of the longest chapters in the letter,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.260]   Paul's first letter to the Corinthians,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.900]   and it's written specifically about marital status.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.100]   Should I keep it, change it, or not worry about it?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.420]   He writes this in verse 28.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.020]   But if you do marry, you have not sinned.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.860]   But those who marry will face many troubles in this life,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.940]   and I want to spare you of this.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.780]   What does he say?
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.100]   Wait, those who marry will have lots of sex.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.940]   Wait, what is he?
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.460]   He wants to tell us something about,
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.800]   those who marry will have troubles.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.020]   In fact, this is the only marital guarantee in the Bible.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.020]   Those who marry will face troubles.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.380]   Okay, Paul, what else?
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.980]   Verse 32, I would like you to be free from concern,
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.360]   literally translated anxieties.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.140]   I would like you to be free from these worries.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.900]   An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.540]   how he can please the Lord.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.060]   Speaking to single people.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.420]   Single people are concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.140]   They live to please the Lord,
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.260]   but a married man is concerned about the affairs
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.620]   of this world, how he can please his wife,
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.300]   and his interests are divided.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.460]   An unmarried woman or virgin,
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.500]   it's interesting that he just uses that synonymously.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.460]   Virgin would be like fiance or engaged.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.880]   And when he talks about an unmarried woman,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.620]   he just assumes in the scriptures,
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.780]   writing to the church, that she's a virgin.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.540]   I don't say that out of condemnation,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.780]   but just to teach the text
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.240]   so that you would have an understanding of it.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.260]   A virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.740]   Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.940]   in both body and spirit.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.540]   But a married woman is concerned
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.140]   about the affairs of this world,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.500]   how she can please her husband.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.540]   And so a summary of that passage would be,
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.140]   with marriage comes new worries.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.360]   So you think you're anxious today,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.140]   imagine when you add someone else into the picture
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.420]   and you are suddenly anxious,
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.540]   not just about what you're going to do,
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.780]   where you're going to work,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.140]   how you're going to eat,
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.980]   or anything, what you're going to drive,
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.060]   but now you're worried about what they're going to drive,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.620]   where y'all are going to live,
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.220]   what you're going to do,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.640]   and your worries double in that situation.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.740]   You're concerned about how you will please your spouse,
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.400]   but the concerns, listen closely,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.980]   the concerns of a single person should be
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.500]   how to please the Lord.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.420]   And so I want to talk about with you
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.580]   that singleness is not what you think.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.020]   Singleness is not what you think.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.620]   In fact, the apostle Paul calls it a gift
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.260]   in the same chapter in verse seven.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.700]   He says, "I wish that all of you were as I am,
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.980]   "but each of you has your own gift from God.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.180]   "One has this gift, another has that."
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.060]   When he says, "I wish all of you were as I am,"
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.480]   he's talking about his Facebook status of single.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.140]   And he says, "It's a gift."
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.780]   And you think, well, if it's a gift,
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.620]   does it come with a receipt?
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.700]   Can I return this gift?
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.060]   Or it's like a white elephant gift that no one wants.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.900]   You know, you're quickly trying to pass it around.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.260]   He says, "No, you don't understand.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.540]   "It's a gift, it's useful."
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.300]   It's not just something that you play with.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.540]   It's not just something that you squander.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.460]   It actually serves a purpose.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.860]   God, in his sovereignty, has you with this status
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.860]   this evening so that you would do something incredible,
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.220]   that you would use your life to change the world
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.960]   for the cause of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.200]   Wow.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.580]   He calls it a gift because it's used for something.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.160]   We think, listen, we think that singleness
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.280]   is a time to live our lives, to see the world,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   to sow our wild oats, to make mistakes, to party,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.880]   and we've got it all wrong.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.360]   Like, if you're like, "Hey, I'm not ready
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.500]   "to get married yet because I still wanna have some fun."
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.280]   You have a misunderstanding of marriage.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.480]   Then you have a misunderstanding of singleness.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:11.700]   He says it's the time to do rich ministry,
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.460]   that that's where life is found.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:21.660]   Have you guys ever heard of, like, single for a season,
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.780]   single for a reason?
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.920]   You ever heard of that?
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.880]   Single for a, how do I know if I'm single for a season
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.640]   or single for a reason?
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.080]   Need truth tellers, you know?
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.200]   How do you know if you have the gift of singleness?
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.040]   I'm gonna tell you right now.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.220]   Like, I can tell you without a doubt
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.720]   if you have the gift of singleness right now.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.000]   You ready?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   You're about to find out right now.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.520]   What I'm about to say next is going to identify you
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.920]   as gift of singleness or not, so get ready.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.760]   You ready?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   If this morning,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.840]   when you woke up, true story, I'm telling you,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.920]   about to be unveiled.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.060]   If when you woke up this morning, you were single,
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.680]   you have the gift of singleness.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.500]   So you have a misunderstanding
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.840]   that it's this chronic terminal illness, right?
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.960]   Like, this is this thing that you can't get rid of.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.480]   No, singleness is a gift for today.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.960]   I don't know about tomorrow or next week
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.160]   or two months from now, but if this morning,
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.980]   if you entered that room, this room single,
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.720]   you today have the gift of singleness.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.600]   That's the gift Paul's talking about.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.400]   It's not this calling on your life
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.000]   that you can't get rid of, that you're cursed, okay,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.960]   that God gave you this desire that will never be fulfilled
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.880]   and so you're angry at God.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.860]   You don't have to think that way.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.700]   God's a good God.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.400]   He gives you good things.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.680]   And so if what you have doesn't seem good to you,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.440]   you don't understand it.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.060]   He's given you a good gift that you may be misusing,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.540]   that you may be misunderstanding.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.700]   It's not chronic.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.800]   It's not terminal.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.000]   It's not a disease.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.100]   It's a gift.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.500]   And if you don't see it as a gift to be used for God,
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.380]   then you don't see it the way God does.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.380]   In fact, the Greek word is charisma.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.160]   It's the gift of God's grace or God's grace to you.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.700]   So how do you know if you're single for a reason?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.000]   You need truth tellers in your life.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.440]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.280]   How do you know if you're single for a reason?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.560]   You are single for a reason.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.900]   That reason is to build the kingdom of God.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.320]   It's to serve God with everything.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   You will never, ever, ever be more uninhibited,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.040]   more available, more ready to serve God
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.400]   than you are right now.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.700]   That is what the apostle Paul is saying here
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   and it is still very, very true in 2016.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.520]   You can wake up this morning
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.320]   and you can just get in God's word
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.720]   with no one to distract you, no one.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.020]   And you're like, you don't know my roommate.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.840]   No, you don't know my roommates.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.380]   'Cause he's four and he gets up before me.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.040]   If I get up at five, he gets up at four.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.200]   And he's ready and he's ready to fight me for waffles
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.040]   or whatever that is.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.860]   And it's a dream.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.480]   If I wanna get in God's word, I've gotta leave the house.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.520]   I don't know about you.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.840]   You can back up that alarm.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.320]   You wanna spend two hours in God's word,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.400]   you just back up that alarm, two hours.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.080]   No one to distract you, no one to say,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.720]   hey, where you going, what are you doing, why are you up?
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.760]   Right?
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.720]   Just be like, I mean, it's not personal,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.120]   but I'm just saying, you can get in God's word
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.000]   without distraction.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.120]   It's unbelievable.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.580]   You can go to the gym.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.240]   You can put in the porch podcast.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.640]   You can be listening.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.520]   You can be, you know, being moved in a sermon.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.800]   No one's texting you saying, hey, where are you at?
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.640]   You gonna be home for dinner?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.460]   Can you run by the store?
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.560]   Can you grab this?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.520]   What time are you gonna be home?
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.480]   Hey, we're sitting at the table waiting on you.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.440]   And some of you are like, oh, but I just want that so bad.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.400]   That's because you're missing out
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.720]   on the season that you're in,
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.120]   wanting to be in a future season.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.800]   Like what you have is second best.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.280]   It's a misunderstanding.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.480]   You have a misunderstanding.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.640]   You can go, like you can live,
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.800]   like let me just hit this on,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   you can live right now on less than $20,000 a year
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.640]   and give away piles and piles of money.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.760]   You can do incredible things and start businesses
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   and, you know, change children's lives.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.480]   I mean, if you make 60,000,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.140]   you literally could give away $40,000 a year.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.160]   You're like, no, you can't.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.920]   I know people who do, okay, in Dallas, Fort Worth,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.360]   Houston, wherever you're at.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.240]   You can.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.160]   You may not, but you can.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.260]   You have one mouth to feed.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.840]   I have five mouths to feed.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.080]   I had to pay for 15 meals today.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.400]   Oh, is that just hitting home?
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800]   Some of you are like, oh, just do the math.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.400]   [congregation laughing]
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.240]   Just do the math.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.920]   Three meals a day 'cause I'm a loving dad.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.220]   I let him eat three times.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.660]   Pretty incredible, I know, I'm a giver.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:27.760]   Yeah, 15 meals today and 15 meals tomorrow
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.320]   and 15 meals the next day.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.880]   And so if you're like, where does this money go?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.000]   That's where it goes.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.680]   They eat a lot.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.000]   You can go on international discipleship trips.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.960]   If you wanna go to Africa, you can be there next week.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.300]   You wanna go to Brazil, you wanna go to Haiti.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.920]   Man, I remember when I came into the faith,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.440]   like it was so amazing.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.480]   When I was a non-believer, I was like,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   man, I'm gonna travel the world, but I didn't.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.440]   I just kept going back to the bar.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.120]   Sin robs you of creativity.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.360]   But then when I became a Christian,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.640]   I mean, I went, like as soon as I became a Christian,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.240]   I went to Africa, went on a safari,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.580]   a photo safari in Africa, literally had the opportunity
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.560]   to teach the government in Africa
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.360]   on conflict resolution, it was incredible.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.660]   I went to the Amazon multiple times,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.920]   got on a boat, traveled days down the Amazon River
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.060]   to get off in villages to engage people
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.680]   for the sake of the gospel, it was incredible.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.520]   Went to the island nation of Haiti.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.440]   I got to do ministry in the mountains of Haiti,
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.320]   ministry in the urban ghetto of Haiti,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.480]   ministry in rural areas of Haiti.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.800]   Incredible.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.280]   And since our family has been growing,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.760]   I haven't done any of those things
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.680]   'cause I have a divided interest.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.200]   With one exception, I went to Haiti, we went for a week.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.040]   I showed up for three days, that's what I,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.600]   I had to get back for like a soccer game
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.160]   or a parent-teacher conference or something, right?
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.240]   Divided interest.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.700]   What are you doing with your singleness right now?
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.000]   Are you using it according to what
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.220]   the apostle Paul is saying?
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.320]   Like some of you, you're enjoying your singleness too much,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.360]   like you don't want the responsibility of marriage,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.460]   but candidly, you don't want
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.640]   the responsibilities of singleness.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.440]   And it's not like you think like,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.900]   oh, but if I serve the Lord, I can't have fun.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.060]   No, what you're doing is not nearly as fun
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.200]   as serving the Lord because serving the Lord is your purpose.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.160]   It's why you have breath in your lungs,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.600]   why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.540]   You're missing out every single day on your purpose.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.160]   Singleness is for you to concern yourself
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.120]   with the things of the Lord.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.760]   And so however hard you pursued God today
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.120]   is indicative of how you're going to pursue him
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.540]   in a season that's much more difficult.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.800]   It is never going to get easier than it was today.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.600]   And you think, well, this is the apostle Paul,
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.000]   and I've read that something crazy's happened
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.260]   in 1 Corinthians 7, and I don't know how this,
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.180]   no, Jesus said the same thing.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.340]   In Matthew 19, Jesus is talking about marriage,
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.720]   and he's like, marriage is permanent,
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.560]   and the disciples are like, marriage is permanent.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.120]   Then we should just stay single.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.880]   And Jesus says this in verse 12.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.720]   There are some, there are those who choose
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.940]   to live like eunuchs.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.780]   What's a eunuch?
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.240]   A eunuch is a unique person.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   No, a eunuch is a person without reproductive organs.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.600]   So there are those who live like those
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.020]   who are committed to celibacy
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.120]   for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.600]   And the one who can accept this should accept it.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.820]   Jesus said, Jesus said, marriage is permanent,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.780]   and singleness is for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.940]   It's over and over, this idea.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.980]   And so you're here, and you're like,
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.820]   but JP, I want to be complete one day.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.140]   You're not incomplete, okay?
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.480]   Was the apostle Paul incomplete?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.540]   Was he not a complete person?
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.700]   He wasn't married, in case you didn't know.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.460]   Do you know who else wasn't married?
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.280]   I'll give you a hint.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.220]   About 33 years of age, single.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.980]   Jesus, God, the most complete person
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.140]   that has ever walked the face of the planet,
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.300]   stayed, remained, died, single,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.780]   and his life was more complete
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.660]   than any of us ours ever will be.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.280]   But I can tell you lots of people.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.260]   There's the Olympian-turned-missionary Eric Liddell.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.400]   There's C.S. Lewis.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.380]   Maybe you've read his books.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.980]   They were written when he was a single person.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.340]   He had time to write
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.940]   those incredible, creative masterpieces.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.060]   You can think about whose life here
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.420]   is more full than that of Mother Teresa's,
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.180]   or Amy Carmichael, who built orphanages.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.420]   She was a missionary to India.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.340]   She founded a mission.
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.180]   She wrote books.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.640]   Corrie ten Boom, who helped protect Jews
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.780]   from the Nazi army.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.740]   She used her singleness in these ways.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.860]   You can think about Katie Davies.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.380]   When she was a single person,
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.340]   she took in 13 girls in Uganda.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.260]   She was a mother to 13 girls as a single woman.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.580]   These are people who used their singleness.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.040]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, when he wanted to fight
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.340]   the Nazi regime, he wanted to build an army of theologians.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.740]   And he had a criteria.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.540]   You must be single.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.900]   An undivided heart.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.420]   'Cause we're about to do work,
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.620]   and I'm gonna teach you the word.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.700]   How you doing at using your singleness?
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.940]   Listen, singleness is not a disease you caught.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.780]   It's a gift.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.780]   Listen, it's not a waiting room.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.080]   Singleness is not a waiting room for some future season.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.680]   It's not second best.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.220]   It's not JV and you're just waiting for varsity to happen.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.380]   That is bad theology.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.640]   The purpose of being single, here's my point.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.520]   The purpose of being single is serving the Lord.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.300]   Plain and simple.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.420]   And so you gotta ask yourself,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.900]   are you okay if 20 years from now,
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.620]   your lot in life is you're a really great aunt
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.900]   to your sister's children?
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.800]   And you disciple some and you love some,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.700]   and you're gonna live a full life of caring for others,
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.300]   and you're gonna die and you're gonna go home
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.100]   and be with Jesus forever and ever and ever and ever,
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.260]   and never ask yourself, why was I just an aunt?
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.860]   'Cause you weren't just an aunt.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.580]   You were God's grace to some children.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.100]   I will tell you, the desire for marriage
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.300]   does not guarantee it, you need to know that.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.380]   Having a desire for marriage does not guarantee,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.780]   you may leave here and be hit with a meteor
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.980]   before you get to your car, okay?
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.000]   I don't know what's gonna happen to you.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.020]   I don't know how this goes.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.060]   You're like, did he say meteor?
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.500]   Yes, I did.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.340]   I don't know what's gonna happen to you.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.420]   But the desire does not guarantee it.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.100]   You don't lose if you remain single,
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.000]   you lose if you waste your singleness.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.940]   So let's talk about dating, how it's not what you think.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.020]   Verse 35, I am saying this for your own good,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.660]   not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.540]   in undivided devotion to the Lord.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.360]   There's a theme.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.660]   If anyone is worried that he might not be acting
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.420]   honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.460]   and if his passions are too strong
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.380]   and he feels he ought to marry,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.340]   as he should do as he wants.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.340]   I think what Paul's doing here is actually speaking
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.300]   to the father of a bride and giving him his advice.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.640]   Hey, if you're worried that they might not be
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.740]   acting honorably, if he may not be acting honorably
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.240]   to your daughter, it's okay if they get married.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.360]   He is not sinning, they should get married.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.180]   But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.940]   who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.060]   and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin,
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.280]   the reason it says virgin is just a word then for fiance.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.060]   Okay?
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.300]   That's why you can just think of that as interchangeable.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.660]   This man also does the right thing.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.220]   So then he who marries the virgin does right,
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.140]   he who does not marry her does better.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.940]   Who would say that singleness is better than marriage?
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.980]   The apostle Paul.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.940]   The apostle Paul would.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.980]   But we don't believe him.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.100]   And so he's giving advice here and he's saying
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.400]   if they wanna get married they can.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.920]   But they're engaged, Paul.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.540]   Like of course they wanna get married.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.480]   He put a ring on it.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.140]   Like they wanna get married, right Paul?
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.520]   And he's saying something really key here
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.360]   that we have to understand.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.320]   He's saying they're not swept up in emotions.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.540]   That this was not the way that we date today,
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.540]   that we give our heart to somebody,
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.780]   that we're completely already swept up
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.420]   in that current heading somewhere.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.800]   He's just talking about this really pragmatic decision.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.140]   Hey, I know that they're engaged.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.460]   If they wanna get married they can,
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.160]   if they don't, they don't have to.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.100]   Why would they be engaged, Paul,
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.140]   if they didn't wanna be married?
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.020]   Well, because then, you know,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.240]   it was people who would love you,
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.320]   would come alongside you and say,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.920]   hey, I think you would be really
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.440]   good partner to that person.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.280]   Y'all should be together.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.400]   And you would listen to them.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.180]   If they were surrendered to God and wise,
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.520]   you would say, okay, I hear that.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.380]   We can get engaged.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.000]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.640]   So far from where we are today.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.940]   But I think there are some things
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.280]   that we can learn from it.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.440]   First Corinthians chapter seven, verse nine,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.720]   same chapter, he says this.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.220]   But if they cannot control themselves,
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.180]   they should marry, for it is better to marry
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.140]   than to burn with passion.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.060]   He's saying something really key here.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.460]   I wanna just spell it out for you
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.980]   in case you've missed it through this series
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.860]   or if you're a first time tonight.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.740]   He's saying one thing.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.380]   He's saying that physical intimacy
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.140]   is allowed in one place and one place only in marriage.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.100]   He's not saying, hey, if they burn with passion,
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.980]   they should masturbate.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.900]   If they burn with passion, they should fornicate.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.940]   If they burn with passion,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.820]   they should do something else to find sexual release.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.240]   He's saying that if they burn with passion,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.920]   if they desire physical intimacy,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.000]   well then the only place that they're gonna be able
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.160]   to find that is marriage.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.840]   That is under God's command, marriage.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.440]   You're like, well, how far is too far?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.560]   When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.960]   you've gone too far.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.140]   Do I need to explain that more?
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.280]   No, she's like, no.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.680]   Okay, good, good.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.280]   I'm glad we're on the same page.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.760]   Physical intimacy.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.560]   And so if you're dating someone, right,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.100]   you're running from that.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.500]   So that may mean for you no alone time,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.620]   no hanging out in the apartment,
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.180]   no going horizontal watching a romantic comedy.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.860]   That's all foolish, man.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.520]   Get married.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.620]   Get married.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.020]   You wanna go horizontal watching a romantic comedy,
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.100]   you can do it all the time when you're married.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   Right now, you just,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.100]   well, let's talk about what you're doing.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.920]   The way that we get married,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.600]   the way that we move from singleness to marriage
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.700]   is this cultural idea of dating.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.840]   And so I don't think,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.860]   I wanna say that God's not trying to penalize you.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.580]   He gives us these instructions for your protection.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.460]   He's not a big fan of broken hearts.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.440]   He's not a big fan of hurt in relationships.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.780]   And so it is God's design.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.580]   You may be here and you're like, well, okay, man,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.980]   you have not painted marriage in a good picture.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.260]   Like, I'm out on that.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.220]   Why would I wanna get married?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.120]   Well, the first reason is because I told you,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.560]   it's the only place for physical intimacy.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.120]   If you want physical intimacy,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.800]   then you probably want marriage.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.200]   That's God's design.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.960]   The second reason is it's God's design for raising children,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.480]   that they would have both a mother and a father in the home.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.400]   And so if you're here and you're like,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.680]   I really want children, then you probably want marriage.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.840]   Marriage is God's design for children.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.600]   It's not the only way to children.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.120]   There are other ways to children, adoption, fostering.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   You can disciple children, you can be a mentor to children,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.880]   but the family unit is God's design for children.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.440]   And so dating is not what you think.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   It's actually a choice.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.280]   To go on a date is not a commitment,
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.980]   but to enter into a dating relationship is a commitment.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.640]   It's a commitment to find out if that person
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.040]   would be a good spouse or not.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.880]   So we only date when we're ready for marriage,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   not before that.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.660]   I know that's so culturally crazy.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.440]   It's so different than the way that we do that.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.100]   Because the crazy thing is, is we've actually taken,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.920]   listen, hear me out on this, tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.360]   test this, try it on.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.400]   We've actually taken advice from Hollywood.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.720]   Hollywood has the highest divorce rate ever,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.900]   anywhere on the planet.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.120]   Anywhere in America, I'll say.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   And they're the ones who are feeding us
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.520]   this relationship advice.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.160]   I mean, it's people who've been married six times
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.700]   are telling you how to date.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.200]   And I would not do that, okay?
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.160]   I would not take that advice.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.200]   And so God gives us instructions on how to do this.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.840]   And I just, I wanna show you something.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.280]   It's not law, but it may be helpful to you.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.880]   And so there's this idea of do I want to,
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.840]   can I, or should I?
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.040]   And so this is when you're thinking,
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.240]   like want to is like,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.960]   man, am I physically attracted?
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.160]   Have I given my heart to them?
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.140]   That's kind of the want to.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.440]   Has my heart drifted their way?
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.200]   The can I is, well, are they married?
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.680]   First of all, are they available?
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.980]   Are they, you know, are they able?
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.160]   Are we, do we like spending time together?
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.040]   All that kind of stuff.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.720]   And then the should I is,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.420]   are they running hard after Jesus?
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.040]   Are they all the things that the crazy pastor said
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.640]   that they should be, you know, should I?
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.680]   And then we get married.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.480]   And so what this looks like is you say,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.640]   okay, well, I definitely want to,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.200]   like he's hot, like she's hot.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.520]   I definitely want to check.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.120]   So now we're at the can I,
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.040]   and you're like, oh, oh wow, she's married.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.440]   Okay, done, right?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.560]   And so then what happens is the breakup, right?
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.480]   And so, oh, oh, and so this is where you start dating
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.160]   'cause you're like, I want to, I'm dating.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.000]   And then you ask the question, well, can I?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.920]   Oh no, we need to break up, I can't.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.480]   The breakup comes and then the heartbreak comes.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   Anybody ever experienced heartbreak?
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.360]   You don't have to raise your hand.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.000]   I have to.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.580]   It hurts, it's not fun.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.680]   And it's just, I don't think it's God's ideal.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.200]   And so we start over, right?
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.040]   And it was like, okay, well, I want to, okay,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.320]   and so we're dating, the can I, I can, yeah,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.520]   they're available, okay?
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.440]   Now it's the should I,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.900]   am I in a place where I should get married?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.480]   Are they in a place where they should get married?
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.960]   Have I worked through my baggage?
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   Am I struggling with porn?
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.120]   Am I not, am I free?
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.920]   Do I have addictions?
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.160]   Should I, are they running hard after Jesus?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.920]   And then you realize that, no, man, I'm, oh my, oh my,
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.400]   they're actually have some addictions.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.220]   There's something going on.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.640]   We should not get married right now.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.080]   There's the X and there's the breakup,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.480]   and this one really hurts.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.760]   And it hurts.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.200]   And so I think what I would propose to you this evening
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.240]   is to take this and turn it around on its head.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.920]   And so before you start dating,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.520]   you're hanging out with people,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.280]   and they're all people who love God's people.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.420]   And they're all people who are pursuing purity.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.320]   They're all people who are pursuing hell
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.480]   through the scriptures, walking according to the spirit.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   And so you're like, should I absolutely,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   any of these people, I am free to marry any of these people.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.960]   I'm in a place where I can marry,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.720]   they're in a place where they can marry.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.360]   And so then it's like, can I?
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.640]   Well, of course, they're available,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.400]   and we enjoy spending time serving God together.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.360]   We're always constantly hanging out.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.920]   And so you've got the can I check,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.200]   but here's the deal, you're not dating yet.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.000]   You're not dating.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.360]   And so now you're like, okay, can I?
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.660]   You know what, I'm going to start dating then, I think.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.800]   I think we can begin to date.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.720]   And so now we're in that dating place,
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.620]   and dating is answering one question.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.120]   Do I want to spend the rest of my life with them?
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.100]   How much time do I need to determine
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.060]   if I want to spend the rest of my life with them?
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.040]   It's good to start with a plan in mind.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.080]   Is that going to take me three months to determine?
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   One month to determine?
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.260]   Is that going to take me six months to determine?
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.440]   I know that they're free to date.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.840]   I know that I can date them.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.200]   Now, do I want to spend the rest of my life with them?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.740]   Is the desire there or is it not?
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.500]   And if it's there, then it's like, meet me at the altar.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.180]   Let's go.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.020]   Why not?
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.460]   Hey, you may be tempted to think I've lost my mind.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.900]   I've had a front row seat for this model now for 10 years.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.200]   I've seen it work really well.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.400]   How are you doing, by the way?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.100]   And I don't mean that offensively.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.600]   How many relationships you've been in?
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.240]   How have they been going?
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.840]   You ever experienced heartbreak?
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.820]   See, I've got this crazy notion
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.420]   that God wants us to give our heart away one time.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.100]   Literally, check this out, wait for this.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.920]   I think God wants you to kiss one person.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.580]   What?
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.140]   I think that as the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.540]   that that's actually his ideal.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.260]   That he's not like, no, on spring break,
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.500]   see how many you can kiss.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.340]   Like, that'll be fun.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.740]   No, that's not how he rolls.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.460]   That's not what he's going for.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.580]   I think dating should actually be the shortest, easiest part.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.200]   It's the place where you have the final conversations
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.780]   that you need to have, and you're just deciding,
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.180]   man, are we for sure, are we going?
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.980]   Are we doing this?
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.380]   Are we, we're gonna go, like, forever and ever and ever.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.640]   'Cause you don't know what marriage holds.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.700]   You don't know what that's gonna look like.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.220]   And some of you have given your heart away
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.180]   long before the date.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.740]   Like, there's girls here that have given their heart away
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.180]   to guys they don't even know.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.780]   I know you learned that from Hollywood.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.080]   I'd be cautious.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.260]   I'm sorry, I know that hurts, I'm sorry.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.780]   And so instead of doing this way,
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.380]   we actually start dating in junior high,
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.940]   and then from there we date multiple people in high school,
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.020]   and from there we actually go to a university
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.940]   that instructs us to divorce.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.260]   Because we jump in a relationship,
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.560]   and as soon as we don't like them anymore,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.860]   we jump out of the relationship.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.300]   Or worse, we're jumping into a relationship,
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.300]   as soon as they don't like us anymore, they jump out.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.620]   And there's baggage in our hearts from that
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.780]   that we are oblivious to.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.460]   We don't even know how bad this process has hurt us.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.340]   We have baggage in our lives that we are blind to
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.280]   because of heartbreak that we've caused
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.380]   and heartbreak that we've experienced.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.380]   And it's not a loving God who's crazy about you,
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.620]   it's not his plan for you.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.300]   He has something better planned for you.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.420]   And I know you didn't know, but I'm so glad you're here.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.920]   I'm so glad you're listening.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.420]   See, I think for us, we look at three things
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.920]   that we prioritize, chemistry and shared interest
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.660]   and physical attraction.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.660]   Do we have chemistry, do we like the same things,
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.260]   am I physically attracted to them?
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.340]   If you read this on a deserted island,
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.620]   there's gonna be three things.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.760]   If you said, hey God, I wanna see what's important to you,
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.300]   there's gonna be three things missing.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.060]   Chemistry, shared interest, and physical attraction.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.220]   Hollywood's gonna tell you that's ultimate.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.820]   God's so much better at this than Hollywood is.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.080]   I know you're learning a new way,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.020]   I know it's crazy, I see some of your wheels turning,
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.220]   you're like, man, I think you might be onto something.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:01.140]   Test it, prove it, see if it's true.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.740]   The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.340]   That's my second point, rather.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.100]   The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:15.260]   And so this brings us to this idea
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.260]   that marriage is not what you think, verse 39.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.500]   Marriage is not what you think.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.160]   A woman is bound to her husband as long as she lives,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.180]   but if her husband dies,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.860]   she is free to marry anyone she wishes.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.600]   But he must belong to the Lord.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.820]   Very strong language here, she is bound,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.700]   that word means they are stuck together,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:36.300]   one in flesh, serving each other for a lifetime,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.740]   serving the Lord together for a lifetime.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.900]   But if he dies, then she's to find someone else
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.900]   who belongs to the Lord, that criteria that's so important
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:47.940]   that they fully belong to the Lord.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.440]   And if he dies, she can remarry, she can find somebody else.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.800]   And so I've asked several married people,
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.240]   several different groups this week,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.080]   hey, what's the one thing that you wish you knew
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.240]   before you were married?
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.360]   And my response and many of their response would be this.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.960]   I wish I knew how practical marriage is.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.480]   Like how much, it's not so much about the feelings
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.320]   and the emotions that are there some days
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.560]   and not other days, it's so much more about
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.400]   just two people strengthening their ministry together,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.540]   raising children together, pouring into their lives together,
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.500]   making disciples together, that you're not looking
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.600]   for some trophy wife, you're looking for someone
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.760]   to go to war with you.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.180]   You're looking for someone to raise children with you,
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.040]   to pour in their lives, someone to study God's word with,
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.460]   it's about companionship.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.140]   Proverbs 18, verse 22 says, "He who finds a wife
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.100]   "finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.300]   See, marriage is hard but good.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.860]   And marriage is good but hard.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.220]   And there's some of you here tonight that believe
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.960]   that marriage is ultimate and what you need to hear tonight
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.060]   is you need to hear that it's also hard.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.100]   And there's some of you here tonight that think,
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.180]   hey, I'm gonna stay single forever so I can keep having fun
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.960]   and what you need to hear is no, marriage is good.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.020]   Marriage is good.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.120]   I went through this workout program here,
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.820]   it's like CrossFit here at Watermark, we call it Well.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.460]   And it's like a eating plan and everything
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.020]   to produce health in your life.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.020]   And I don't, if we know each other, you know I don't
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.940]   really like to work out very much.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.940]   And so as I saw people go through this and they're doing
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.140]   10 flights of stairs and all the crazy things
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.700]   that they were doing, I'm like, I am so out on that.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.860]   And but people kept coming to me like, no, it's good,
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.460]   it's good, I'm like, it just looks hard.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.060]   They're like, no, but it's good.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.580]   And so eventually they talked me into doing this
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.200]   and I got into the program and the room was divided.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.100]   There were people there that knew that it was hard
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.340]   and didn't think that it was good.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.820]   And there were people there that knew that it was good
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.860]   and didn't think that it would be hard.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.420]   And the truth was it was really hard
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.440]   and really, really good.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.540]   It produced so much fruit in my life.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.980]   It changed the way that I think about these things.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   I'm so glad that I went through it.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.540]   And every day it was really, really hard.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.060]   But it made me better in every way.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.300]   And that's the way that I think about marriage.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.120]   It's often like you going to the same place
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.740]   with the same people, same place with the same people.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.900]   It's a lot like working out
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.700]   or being a part of a CrossFit box
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.660]   or going to a gym or running a race or climbing a mountain
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.180]   or whatever metaphor best resonates with you.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.660]   It's like you're doing this thing that's good
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.220]   and challenging all the time with the same people.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.060]   And sooner or later you look around
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.140]   and you see her, you know, or him.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.820]   And you're like, man, we've been doing this together.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.220]   We've been serving the Lord together.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.580]   We've been going to church together,
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.840]   the same church, the same place,
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.080]   running in the same groups of friends,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.840]   serving at the same soup kitchen,
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.020]   going on the same international trips.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.540]   Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.020]   And it's that simple.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.340]   And I'm not even kidding.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.260]   I'm not even playing, man.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.400]   It is that, and try it your way.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.940]   And if your way doesn't work, try it his way.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.980]   I wish you didn't have to try it your way though
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.420]   'cause it's gonna be painful.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:23.040]   He says, "What I mean, brothers and sisters,
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.240]   "is that the time is short.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.900]   "From now on, those who have wives
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.820]   "should live as if they do not."
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.440]   Why does he say that?
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.700]   Why does he say that in verse 29 of 1 Corinthians 7?
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.180]   Those who have wives should live as if they don't.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.100]   Because remember what he said,
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.200]   those who don't have wives should live
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.940]   like undevoted service to the Lord.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.940]   And he's saying those who have wives
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.260]   now have someone to serve the Lord with.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.020]   I remember when Monica and I were engaged,
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.260]   12 years ago, we sat in this man's office,
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.020]   this preacher's office, we were brand new Christians,
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.740]   and this guy saw us, and we were very passionate people.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.220]   We had given ourselves to each other through sex
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.060]   and all sorts of sin, then we became Christians.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.740]   We trusted in Christ and we did our best
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.320]   to stop all of that and begin to pursue him,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.080]   but we were still pursuing each other.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.160]   And this guy just looked at us,
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.720]   saw these two passionate people
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.360]   wildly in love with one another,
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.880]   and he just said, "You guys need to stop pursuing each other
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.960]   "and start pursuing Christ together."
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.200]   And I sat there and I nodded my head and I smiled,
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.440]   and what was going on in my head is,
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.400]   "You are the stupidest man I've ever heard.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.020]   "That is the dumbest thing."
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.400]   I'm like, "Okay, preacher man,
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   "would you read that in some preacher handbook?
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.700]   "Stop pursuing each other.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.520]   "We're about to get married, don't you know?"
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.760]   And he just said this, he goes,
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.640]   "When you pursue each other, you miss.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   "It's manic highs and manic lows.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.940]   "You guys are so full of passion towards each other.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.340]   "If you took all of that passion
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.600]   "and you directed it to God
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.280]   "and you pursued God with your entire life,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.560]   "you're just gonna grow closer and closer
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.940]   "and closer and closer and closer,
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.800]   "but God has to be ultimate, not each other."
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.600]   And guys, it changed everything about me, that advice.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.840]   I look back on that, it was so prophetic in my life.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.880]   God used that in profound ways to save my marriage.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.320]   And then when we started pursuing God together,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.800]   everything changed for us.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.440]   It's the best marriage advice I ever could have had.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.080]   And so marriage is a picture of Christ's commitment to us.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.600]   In fact, the purpose of marriage,
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.040]   this is my third and final point,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.240]   the purpose of marriage is to display
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.040]   God's covenant with us.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.400]   That word covenant there, it's more than a promise.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.820]   It's more than a commitment.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.020]   A commitment is, I will if you do.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.020]   It has terms.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.420]   A covenant is, I will regardless of what you do.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.120]   This is beautiful because if you've looked at porn,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.040]   God's pursued you.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.800]   If you've had sex, God's pursued you.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.320]   If you've had abortions, God's pursuing you.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.060]   He has a covenant towards you.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.320]   It's a covenant that will be completed
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.600]   regardless of what you do,
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.020]   if you've trusted his payment for your sins
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.360]   through Jesus Christ, his death,
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.920]   as a payment for your sins and his resurrection
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.240]   of evidence of his power,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.700]   that power that could be at work in your life.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.620]   And so the purpose of marriage
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.460]   is to display God's covenant with us.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.980]   A great verse on that is Ephesians 5, verse 31.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.900]   "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.780]   "and be united to his wife,
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.960]   "and the two will become one flesh."
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.500]   And then he says this.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.080]   "This is a profound mystery,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.980]   "but I'm actually talking about Christ in the church."
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:34.140]   That Jesus is the bridegroom or the groom of the church.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:38.480]   And we're his bride.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.820]   And he's coming back for us.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.560]   And the narrative in this book, guys,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.700]   listen, you gotta get this.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.180]   If you wanna get marriage right, you gotta get this.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.660]   The narrative in this book,
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.660]   it's about another relationship,
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:55.240]   not the one that you would have with your spouse,
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.420]   the one that the church, God's chosen people,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.340]   has with him.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.640]   And so I've gone through this,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.760]   and you might pick up on that I'm a fan of young marriage.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.460]   I'm a fan of short engagement.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.580]   I'm not a fan of dating until you're ready for marriage.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.600]   And I'm a fan of changing the world while you're single.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.280]   And so in summary, the purpose of being single
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.480]   is serving the Lord.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.640]   and the purpose of marriage
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.860]   is to display God's covenant with us.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.640]   I didn't understand all this
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.240]   until I really saw the beautiful metaphor that marriage is,
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.480]   that's in the Scriptures,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.520]   and really in the Hebrew Jewish wedding tradition,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.560]   but I gotta tell it to you,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.320]   and I think that you'll be inspired by it as well.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.680]   And so the way that marriage would work
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.400]   at the time that the Scriptures were written here
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.640]   is that a young Jewish child, a young Jewish boy,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.280]   would leave his town,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.240]   and he would go in search for a bride.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   He'd go to the church,
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.600]   he'd go in search for a bride.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.880]   He'd go to a foreign land in search for a bride.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.340]   And when he would find her,
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.280]   his father, his dad, would pay what was called the dowry.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.740]   His dad would purchase his right to marry her.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.440]   And the two would drink from a cup together.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.400]   This is where we get so many of the traditions
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.280]   we still celebrate today, the wedding toast, if you will.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.120]   The two would drink from the same cup.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.880]   This is why Jesus says, "Can you drink from this cup?"
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.060]   And then he would return to his dad's house.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.000]   Listen, guys.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.360]   And he would begin to build a room on his dad's house
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.920]   because that was his inheritance.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.840]   Like, he was gonna get the property, his father's property.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.740]   And so he built what was called a bridal chamber.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.840]   It was a room for him and his wife to live in.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.120]   Now, she doesn't know when he's coming back for her,
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.200]   but here's what she knows.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.960]   She knows from that moment forward that she belongs to him,
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.120]   that at some point, unbeknownst to her,
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.280]   that he's gonna come return for her
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.680]   to take him home to himself.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.880]   And she doesn't know the time or the hour.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.160]   And when he's finished with that room,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.960]   he gets his wedding party together.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.720]   His groomsmen, we call 'em today.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.840]   She gets her bridal party together.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.520]   Her bridesmaids, we call 'em today.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.560]   See, then bridesmaids actually did something.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.800]   It wasn't just right over left and smile.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.280]   They were making her wedding dress.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.000]   They were making her wedding dress.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   They would remind her daily that she belongs to him,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.880]   that he's gonna return for her.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.720]   And then check this out.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.680]   What would happen is his groomsmen, his boys,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.140]   they would run out in front of him saying, he's coming.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.640]   Your groom is coming for you.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.120]   And they would blow trumpets and make sounds and instruments
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.960]   and that word would travel to towns in front of them
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.600]   like people would spread it.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.960]   Tell her he's coming for her.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.280]   He's on his way.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.780]   And it would reach her and her bridesmaids
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.160]   would come to her house and they'd grab her dress
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.320]   and they would get her all ready and then he would come in
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.680]   and he would take her home with him.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.580]   And before she entered the bridal chamber,
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.320]   she would be washed, cleansed, cleaned.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.680]   And there was a party waiting for them,
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.640]   but they would go into the bridal chamber
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.200]   and they would consummate the marriage.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.300]   They would make love.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.720]   They would pursue physical intimacy
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.560]   in the place of where it was intended
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.000]   with everybody waiting outside, could you imagine?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.840]   Crazy.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.160]   And then she would come out with him
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.340]   and he would present to his friends and family
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.040]   for the first time his bride, we're married.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.960]   And the party would continue for seven days
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.280]   where we get the tradition of the honeymoon.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.640]   For seven days they would party.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.700]   For seven days they would celebrate this new relationship.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.940]   Friends, don't you see when Doubting Thomas said,
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:57.780]   "Where are you going?
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.620]   "How will we get there?
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.580]   "We do not know the way."
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.980]   And Jesus says to him, "You do know the way.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.320]   "In my father's house are many rooms.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.000]   "I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.380]   "I'm coming back for you.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.420]   "I'm coming to take you back home with me."
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.020]   See, this book doesn't say a lot about dating
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.500]   because this book is about another relationship,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.180]   a much better relationship, an eternal relationship.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.760]   It's not till death do us part, it's eternity we don't part.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.700]   It's not for a lifetime, it's for an eternal lifetime,
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.700]   God's radical, reckless pursuit of you.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.820]   And friends, I gotta tell you something, you're pursued.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.880]   You wanna be pursued right now, you are being pursued.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.400]   Not just pursued, but you've been chosen.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.100]   The God of the universe looks you in the eyes and says,
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.340]   "I choose you to spend the rest of the rest with."
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.720]   And not just chosen, but you've been loved.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.800]   He said, "I love you so much
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:04.920]   "that I'm going to prepare an eternal home for you
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.840]   "where your eternal family will be."
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.300]   See, in heaven, no one's married.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.340]   Monica and I won't be married in heaven.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.760]   We'll both be married to Jesus in heaven.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.560]   I know that sounds churchy, man,
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.720]   but I want you to pursue it, prove me wrong.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.920]   Grab this book tonight and just go through it
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.520]   and say, "I don't know, married to Jesus, are we sure?"
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.880]   Spend some time looking at it.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.440]   You're chosen, you're pursued, you're loved,
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.860]   he's prepared a home for you.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.200]   Listen to this part, you gotta hear this.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.640]   You're gonna be washed clean.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.540]   If you trusted in Christ, his death and resurrection
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.720]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.880]   you've been washed clean,
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.680]   but you still sit in this broken world,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.820]   and so you're not glorified yet,
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.160]   you're gonna be carried back to the finish line.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.940]   You'll be washed clean, spotless, no abortion,
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:58.320]   pornography, filth, that thing you did on the prom night,
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.560]   it's all gone, washed clean.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.120]   Beautiful, man, so beautiful.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.540]   And then this part, and I know it's weird,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.720]   but you get to share in the eternal pleasures
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.120]   with God forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.840]   Forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.320]   I know you got these desires for pleasure right now,
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.200]   I get it, man.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.260]   People are like, "But you're married,
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.100]   "you have someone to go home with."
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.800]   You don't think I remembered what it was like to be single?
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.740]   I was single in Dallas.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.980]   I dated in Dallas.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:33.220]   I dated in DFW, looking for a spouse.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.760]   I was where you were, I hadn't forgotten what it's like.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.840]   I know it's hard, but it's worth it.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   It's worth it.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.640]   You're loved, friends.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.240]   And Father, we thank you just for this truth.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.120]   For all that you've done for us through Jesus.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.800]   For your reckless pursuit of us through Christ.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.120]   For the way that you woo us, the way that you choose us,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.320]   the way that you pursue us, the way that you love us,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.880]   the way that you've purchased us,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.600]   the way that you've given us,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.720]   purchased us, the way that you cleanse us,
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.280]   the way that you wash us.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.780]   Daddy, we love you.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.100]   Father, we love you.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.440]   Jesus, we love you.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.120]   Holy Spirit, we love you.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.040]   Would you help us?
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.220]   We know we messed up.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.360]   We know we messed up.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.600]   God, would you help us?
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.400]   Would you help us understand the covenant love
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.480]   that you have for us?
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.240]   Would you help us understand the metaphor
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.120]   that marriage is?
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.480]   Help us to walk in it, to live it.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:49.200]   In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
