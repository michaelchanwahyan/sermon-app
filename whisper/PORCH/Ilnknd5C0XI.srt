1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Hey Porch, please join me as we read God's Word together from

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,840
 the Gospel of Matthew chapter 22 verses 34 through 40.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,280
 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,440
 Sadducees, they gathered together and one of them, a

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,200
 lawyer, asked him a question to test him.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,160
 Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,560
 And he said to him, you shall love your Lord, you shall love

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,000
 the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
 with all your mind.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,000
 This is the great and first commandment.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,480
 And a second is like it.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,520
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,720
 On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,640
 Now our third message in our series called Disciple.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,600
 And it's about the Lord's love for you.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,800
 Well Porch, how are we doing?

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,880
 We doing okay?

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,280
 Man, it's good to see you guys.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
 So glad that you'd be back with us this evening.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
 Special shout out to Porch Live.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,080
 Love that y'all would tune in with us.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,160
 And a special shout out to Porch Live Indy, Dayton and

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,840
 Greater Lafayette.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,800
 We love you guys and we believe in what God is doing where you

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,160
 are.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,880
 Well, a couple of years ago, I and close to a hundred other

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
 young adults descended upon Colorado for a week's worth of

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,960
 snow skiing.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,520
 I was jazzed for it because this is an activity that I've done

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
 since I was a very small child.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
 We have pictures actually of me snow skiing with a leash from

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,480
 my dad, actual evidence of me sleeping as I'm going down the

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,520
 mountain because I was so young.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,920
 And so the thought of going and skiing was really exciting for

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,040
 me.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,680
 Like I love this activity.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,160
 It's one of my favorite things to do and I've been doing it for

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,680
 a long time.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,480
 And so I've kind of hit this point in my snow skiing journey

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,400
 where I've moved beyond the basics and now I kind of focus

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,080
 on some of the more sophisticated aspects of the

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,400
 sport.

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,720
 Like I don't just want to plow down the mountain.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,320
 I actually want to hockey stop instead because that's way

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,840
 cooler.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,480
 I know how to actually navigate through moguls instead of just

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 rolling over the top of them.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
 I know it looks way better though it actually doesn't

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 necessarily impact the sport much.

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,200
 If you keep your knees together, you look much more poised and

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
 elegant as you go down the mountain rather than just being

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,920
 widespread and crossing your skis up.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,120
 I know some of the aspects of the sophisticated elements to

54
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,640
 the sport.

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
 And yet when you go on a trip with 100 other young adults,

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
 what you realize is you get a mixed bag of talent.

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
 You do.

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,760
 100 young adults.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,400
 We had some people on this trip that they came and they had all

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,360
 of their own gear.

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,040
 Like they had been like me grown up in the sport and they love

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
 to go and do it.

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,760
 They had season passes and so whenever they got the chance to

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
 go, they looked the part.

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,160
 And yet we also had other people that had never seen snow before

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,760
 in their life.

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,200
 A true mixed bag of talent.

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,840
 And so it occurred to me as being one of the leaders on this

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,440
 trip working with a team to organize this ski escapade that

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,880
 I needed to help those newbies on the mountain make their way

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,960
 without too much trouble.

72
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,040
 And so I abandoned all of my sophisticated understanding of

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,840
 the sport and I began to contemplate the philosophical

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,920
 question, what is snow skiing?

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,600
 To which I arrived at the conclusion, it's two things.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,040
 It is speed and it is control.

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,920
 Fundamentally, if you're going to teach someone how to ski, you

78
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,680
 need to help them regulate their speed and you need to help them

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,120
 control their direction.

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,480
 Like you need them to be able to hit the brakes.

81
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 Otherwise that ends very badly.

82
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,400
 And you need to help them learn to turn left and to turn right.

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
 You see, I had to boil it down to the most fundamental skills

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,440
 possible.

85
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,600
 And so once I had deduced what it looked like to teach snow

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,920
 skiing, I assembled Kylan's very own ski school.

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,240
 And here I was skiing down the mountain with 30 to 40 young

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,680
 adults skiing right behind me like a mother and her ducklings.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,920
 We were just making our way down the mountain.

90
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 You see, my goal in teaching them how to ski was I didn't

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,480
 just want them to survive the mountain.

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,560
 I wanted to help them thrive.

93
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,960
 On the mountain.

94
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,760
 Now, why do I tell you that?

95
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,320
 Because you and I in the story of Jesus Christ are the ducklings.

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,360
 We're those that are following after our leader down the

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,320
 proverbial mountain of life.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 And his desire is to help us not just survive life, but really

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,080
 thrive in life.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,120
 And so he wants to give us some fundamental skills, some very

101
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,880
 elementary lessons, those, that knowledge, which is most

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,840
 critical of all.

103
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,360
 So that way we can follow him in a way that looks like he

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,960
 himself.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,920
 And that's what we're going to talk about tonight.

106
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,680
 What is that most fundamental, critical lesson from Jesus?

107
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,880
 And we find it in Matthew chapter 22.

108
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,840
 So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,600
 Turn with me to Matthew chapter 22.

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,320
 If you don't have a Bible, do not worry.

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,720
 You can find it on the screens behind me.

112
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
 We also would love to give you one.

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
 If you don't have a copy of the scripture, we'd love to give

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
 that to you as a gift.

115
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,200
 While you're turning there, let me just set up the fact that

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
 we're in a series called Disciple, where we've been

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,320
 trying to really wrestle with this idea that we don't want to

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,640
 settle for just knowing about Jesus.

119
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,200
 But instead we want to know the real Jesus.

120
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,160
 And some of you were in the room and you're like, I know Jesus,

121
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,360
 man.

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,880
 Like I understand live a life of good and die to death, observe

123
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
 rose from the grave, beat death by death itself.

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,400
 Got it.

125
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,720
 And yet I genuinely believe there's more of Christ to see

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
 for you tonight.

127
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
 And so if you're here and you feel like I know this lesson

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
 already, first and second greatest command, I don't need

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,760
 to worry about what this guy's going to say, then you're

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,120
 mistaken because this lesson put me on my heels.

131
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,040
 It peeled back new layers of understanding that I did not

132
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
 know myself.

133
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,920
 And so I would invite you to just let the spirit work in this

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,520
 moment, because I think God has something very special in store

135
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,280
 because we come to Matthew chapter 22.

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,480
 What we need to know as we desire to see the real Jesus is

137
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,000
 that Jesus is in the last week of his life, meaning everything

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,240
 he's going to say and everything he's going to do and everything

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,760
 he's going to think like everything about this man's life

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 here in his last week, it matters so much.

141
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,680
 Like if you want to know what matters to someone, look at how

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,320
 they prioritize their time.

143
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,200
 When time's running out, Jesus has one week to live.

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
 And so he doesn't have any time to waste.

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,480
 Everything he's going to do is meaningful because the moments

146
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,280
 he has left, they matter.

147
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,720
 You tracking with me on this?

148
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,040
 So when we find him, he's already entered into Jerusalem.

149
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,400
 He's already overturned all the money changers tables.

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
 And we see that he is in a verbal debate, a verbal

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,480
 altercation with the religious leaders.

152
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,080
 And it says this in verse 34, but when the Pharisees heard

153
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
 that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

154
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,520
 And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him,

155
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,120
 teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law.

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
 Now, it may be tough to pick up just from jumping in the middle

157
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
 of the story, but tensions are pretty high when we find Jesus

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
 in this moment, because the religious leaders, they're not

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,400
 fans of Jesus whatsoever.

160
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,680
 And so they have decided to try to incriminate him.

161
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,600
 They want to call into question his credibility.

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,560
 And yet we see that he's already had two other debates up to

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,080
 this moment.

164
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,480
 This is the third of three debates in the story.

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,040
 The first two were with the Sadducees, and we've seen that

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,360
 they've tucked tail and they've run because he's whooped them

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,920
 up, you know, he's two and O.

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,600
 And so the Pharisees decide that they've got something for him.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,040
 And so they do what any sensible person would do.

170
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,960
 They phone a friend and they decide to get the best person to

171
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
 debate Jesus as possible.

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,760
 If you're organizing a debate team and you're going through

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,560
 the line and you're picking out your players, the lawyer is a

174
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,160
 pretty good person to pick because that tends to be what

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,080
 they do for a living.

176
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,040
 And so they pick this guy who's a trained scholar on the Old

177
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,840
 Testament, specifically the Pentateuch, those first five

178
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,600
 books of the Bible.

179
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,680
 And by remedy calculation, he would be very familiar with the

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
 613 commands that those first five books contain.

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
 He is the definition of a textbook nerd.

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,000
 Okay.

183
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,520
 And he decides to come to Jesus and according to the Pharisees

184
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,240
 test him.

185
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,560
 And yet, if you read the gospel of Mark, what you realize is

186
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,360
 this man may not actually have malicious intent.

187
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,640
 The Pharisees, they want to incriminate Jesus.

188
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,280
 But this guy is genuinely curious.

189
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,280
 We see that he comes to Jesus and Mark and he says, "Teacher,

190
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,520
 which is the greatest commandment in the law?"

191
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,080
 Like of all the governing principles, of all 613 rules to

192
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
 follow, which is the most important?

193
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,960
 It's like what you feel whenever you're listening to someone

194
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,440
 explain the rules to a really complicated game.

195
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
 Have you ever had this experience where you're listening

196
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
 to someone and they're trying to tell you how to play this

197
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
 sophisticated game.

198
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
 And so they're telling you all the rules and it feels like

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,360
 they've been talking for what is kind of like an hour and you

200
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,960
 reach this boiling point where you're like, "Just tell me how

201
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
 I'm supposed to win."

202
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
 That's what this guy's doing.

203
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 He's like, "I know all of the minutia of the law, all 613

204
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,120
 rules, but I just want to know like, what's the most important

205
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,040
 one, like of all of it?

206
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
 How do I win?

207
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,680
 Like of all the regulation and all the rule that God's given

208
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,880
 in the game of life, tell me how I'm supposed to win."

209
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,320
 And so Jesus answers him.

210
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,560
 He says in verse 37, "You shall love the Lord your God with all

211
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,320
 your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."

212
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,240
 This is the great in the first commandment.

213
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,920
 He quotes the Shema, which was a prayer given to the nation of

214
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,120
 Israel by God as they entered into the promised land.

215
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,280
 And so we read this in Deuteronomy.

216
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,320
 It says this, this is the Shema, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 God, the Lord is one.

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,240
 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all

219
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,880
 your soul and with all your might."

220
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,960
 Jesus answers this guy's question with something so special to the

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,200
 heritage of the nation of Israel that for 1400 years from the

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,120
 date of which it was given, they would have recited this prayer

223
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,480
 twice every single day.

224
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,920
 It's hard to pull into our modern context, but like the

225
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,800
 best equivalent I can think of is kind of like our pledge of

226
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,360
 allegiance and our national anthem all rolled up into one.

227
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,160
 Like that's kind of what they're doing.

228
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,920
 But instead of this being to America, this is a pledge and

229
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,200
 it's a praise to God.

230
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,880
 Like it's a declaration of a love to God, but it's also a

231
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
 celebration of a loving God.

232
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,160
 That's what he tells him.

233
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,040
 And what we find is that this teaching, it tells us what

234
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,480
 matters most in life, which is to love the Lord.

235
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,220
 That's it.

236
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,600
 Like, if you're wondering like, man, what matters most in life?

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,000
 It's to love God.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,960
 And yet what we see is that Jesus, he qualifies what that

239
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
 love should look like.

240
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,800
 He says that it's with your heart and with your soul and

241
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,320
 with your mind.

242
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
 And so I want to unpack for you over the course of the rest of

243
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
 our time, what those mean.

244
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,160
 How do we actually do that?

245
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
 And I mean, I'm just going to level with you.

246
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,640
 This is really like five sermons in one.

247
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,080
 So if you're taking notes, just like buckle up, you know,

248
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,960
 because we're going to really make a move here.

249
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,520
 You know, if you're thinking like how many points I'm just

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,160
 going to tell you, we got four points up top.

251
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,920
 We've got a lot of ground to cover and I'm just going to try

252
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,600
 to race through it as well as I can and honor your time.

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,240
 I just think it's so important.

254
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,780
 Okay.

255
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,760
 So here we go.

256
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,080
 The first thing you need to know as you try to love God is you

257
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 need to know that love for God is expressive in life.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,560
 Love for God is expressive in life.

259
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,440
 That's what it means when it says we should love the Lord

260
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
 with all of our heart.

261
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,160
 Now we need to be careful because our Western mind often

262
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
 equates the heart with emotion.

263
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,800
 But the Eastern mind, the context with Jesus speaking,

264
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,560
 would have equated the heart not with emotion, but with

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,480
 expression, meaning the heart is way more than just the source

266
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,360
 of our feelings.

267
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
 It's the source of our desire.

268
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,640
 So what's the difference?

269
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,360
 Well, I'll put it to you like this.

270
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,600
 When you have feelings for someone, you experience emotion.

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,320
 But when you desire someone, that emotion evolves into a

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,640
 particular kind of expression.

273
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,400
 So when you're interested in someone, you're not just content

274
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,880
 to admire them from afar.

275
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,160
 Instead, whenever you feel a desire to be with that person,

276
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 I want to be with them.

277
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,760
 What do you do?

278
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,680
 That emotion turns into expression.

279
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
 You start texting them.

280
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
 You start talking to them and asking about them and you get

281
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
 on their social media and you like those posts very

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,040
 strategically so that way they see that you have been watching.

283
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
 Go far enough back that way they know that this wasn't

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,520
 cursory in any way whatsoever.

285
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,560
 You may actually slide into their DMs.

286
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,280
 I'm not promoting nor condoning that that's the right proper

287
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,040
 step, but that is an expression that you may take as you're

288
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,560
 desiring to express your undying love for this person.

289
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,440
 Like this is often what happens.

290
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,080
 We find that our love, that we love them from our heart, not

291
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,200
 just emotionally, but expressively.

292
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,440
 Matthew 12, 34, it says for out of the abundance of the heart,

293
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
 the mouth speaks.

294
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,920
 Like God cares about how we live our lives.

295
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,080
 But here's what's really important to understand.

296
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,240
 God doesn't just want your obedience in life.

297
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
 Like he doesn't just want your conformity to his will or your

298
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,920
 compliance to his rules.

299
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,000
 That's not what he's out for.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,640
 Like God wants your heart.

301
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,920
 That's what he wants.

302
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,520
 Like he wants your heart more than anything.

303
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,880
 He wants you to feel a love for him emotionally that overflows

304
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,400
 the banks of your life and expresses itself practically.

305
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,360
 That's what he wants.

306
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,040
 He doesn't just want you to have all the feels, but do nothing with them.

307
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,880
 He wants you to have all the feels and those feels lead to a different way of

308
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,040
 life that ultimately impact the person you are.

309
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,800
 He doesn't want us to just act out of obligation.

310
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,000
 Oh, I've got to do this.

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,480
 He wants you to act out of inclination.

312
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,400
 I want to do this.

313
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,280
 That's what this means, which is exactly what one of my seminary

314
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,200
 professors used to teach us.

315
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,520
 He used to say our external determinations depend on our internal

316
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,720
 inclinations, which just very simply means this, that you pick in the world,

317
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,600
 whatever you prefer at heart.

318
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,720
 That's it.

319
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,320
 You pick in the world, whatever you prefer at heart.

320
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,800
 So there's not probably a soul in this room that loves their alarm clock.

321
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
 You laugh because you hate it.

322
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,200
 It goes off and it's like, oh my gosh, I can't turn the thing off quickly enough.

323
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,520
 You know?

324
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,800
 And yet the irony is we snooze it so it can just hit us again in 10 minutes.

325
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,280
 You know, it's just crazy that that's the case.

326
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,480
 And yet, not a soul in this room likes their alarm clock.

327
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,760
 We actually, in fact, hate our alarm clock.

328
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,360
 So why do we keep setting it every single night?

329
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,880
 Because we love the job it wakes us up for in the morning, or at least we want to keep

330
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,720
 the job that it wakes us up for in the morning.

331
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,120
 I know.

332
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,000
 You want to keep the job.

333
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,320
 You want to keep the job that it wakes you up for in the morning.

334
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,680
 Here's why I've used this example.

335
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:03,720
 Your greatest inclination is to make a paycheck, keep your job, not get more sleep.

336
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:13,440
 You see, your greatest internal inclination determines your external determination.

337
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
 That's what's happening here.

338
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
 That's what Jesus is getting at when he's saying, hey, love the Lord with all your

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
 heart, because he wants your actions in life, like how you speak and what you do and

340
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
 the choices you make and the way you treat other people and the conduct you keep.

341
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,120
 He wants all of that to spill forth, overflow from a place of loving God.

342
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,960
 Proverbs 27, 19 says, "As in water, face reflects face.

343
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,440
 So the heart of man reflects the man."

344
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,960
 You see, our heart reflects what's actually true about us.

345
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,600
 So what's your heart saying about you?

346
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,080
 What's your heart actually saying about you?

347
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,440
 If you can just do an evaluation here tonight, if you can do some investigative work on

348
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
 the internal aspects of your soul, what's it saying?

349
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,520
 Like the way you figure it out is you identify the actions that you do take in life, and

350
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,800
 then you question the motivations that undergird them.

351
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,480
 That's how you figure out what's going on in your heart.

352
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,920
 Like what does it tell you about your heart when you can't ever seem to say something

353
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
 nice to that coworker at the office?

354
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,280
 Or you always slip into cursing whenever you're around that group of friends.

355
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,480
 Or you habitually flirt with girls, though you never have an intent to actually commit

356
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
 to pursuing one.

357
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,520
 Or you complain regularly about your family, or you act like everything's okay, and you

358
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
 put on a strong face even when you know that things are not okay.

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
 What's your heart actually saying?

360
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,680
 Listen, God wants your heart.

361
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:06,440
 And if your heart doesn't want Him, then He wants you to be honest about that.

362
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,600
 He already knows.

363
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
 You're not hiding something from Him that He doesn't already know.

364
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
 So He would rather you be honest.

365
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
 If you don't want me, just tell me.

366
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,480
 Because you can't fix your heart, but I can.

367
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,960
 But I will fix it when you're willing.

368
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,960
 I will step in to the hurt of your heart whenever you're ready.

369
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,800
 And you will not be able to love me until I do so.

370
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,440
 You see, some of us here, we do want God with all of our heart.

371
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
 But maybe the most honest thing some of us can do here tonight is just say, "God, I

372
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,240
 want to want you with all of my heart, but I don't."

373
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
 He can work with that.

374
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,080
 He can work with it because He's in the business of changing hearts.

375
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,200
 That's who God is.

376
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,040
 He doesn't want you to fabricate obedience.

377
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,400
 He wants genuine desire.

378
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,440
 And if you do not have genuine desire, He wants to start by giving you that first.

379
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,920
 That's the first part of the command that we learn.

380
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,360
 You love the Lord with your heart.

381
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,720
 Okay.

382
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 Next one is you love the Lord with your soul.

383
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,960
 So our point here is love for God is distinctive to ourselves.

384
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,200
 Love for God is distinctive to ourselves.

385
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,280
 It's unique.

386
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,800
 That's what He means when He says, "Hey, love the Lord with your soul."

387
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,840
 Now I'll admit, and maybe this is incriminating because I'm standing on stage.

388
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,920
 I'm supposed to know this stuff.

389
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,160
 But love the Lord with your soul was one of those that I didn't really know what

390
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,640
 we're actually saying.

391
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,720
 Right?

392
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
 Love the Lord with your heart.

393
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,840
 You can kind of make up the difference between what you're hearing and what

394
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,480
 you're understanding.

395
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,800
 I think I know what that means.

396
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,840
 Love the Lord with your mind.

397
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,400
 I think I can kind of work that out and figure out the way that should work.

398
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
 Love the Lord with your soul.

399
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,600
 Like that's a hard thing to consider.

400
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,080
 And for me, as I was reading it, I knew I was like, man, I don't know that I have

401
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,840
 a good answer for that.

402
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,040
 And so this is totally sidebar.

403
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,120
 But for some of you in the room, you actually have doubts, questions about the

404
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
 things that the Bible is saying.

405
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
 Take it from one that had questions in this passage.

406
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
 That's okay.

407
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,800
 If you're confused by something the Bible says, or you have questions about

408
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,240
 something it pulls up, don't worry.

409
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,280
 Like he, he can work with you.

410
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,760
 He can answer those questions.

411
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,120
 There are solutions to your doubts.

412
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,480
 Just lean in and not away.

413
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,560
 So how do we love the Lord with our soul?

414
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,280
 Well, when I began to study this, what I found is that the Hebrew word in the

415
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,640
 Shema for soul is the word Nefesh.

416
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,360
 And it was so illuminating to learn what the meaning of Nefesh was.

417
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:54,240
 Because the meaning of Nefesh when translated directly, it means throat,

418
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,760
 which is a weird swerve, right?

419
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
 You weren't expecting that.

420
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,920
 I wasn't expecting that when I studied it.

421
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,640
 Throat's not exactly what I anticipated I was going to get whenever I was

422
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,280
 romanticizing soul in my mind until I realized in the Hebrew mind, why throat

423
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:20,880
 was significant because in their mind's eye, your life emanates both in and out

424
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
 of your throat.

425
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,280
 Like the very evidence of your existence moves by way of your throat.

426
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,320
 So on a cold day, which we haven't had many of yet, we're going to get them.

427
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,440
 But when we get a cold day, you step outside and you see your breath in the

428
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,800
 air.

429
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
 This is what's crazy.

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,240
 That is the evidence of your existence.

431
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
 You're going to see it like your soul.

432
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,520
 It's like, man, that's the evidence that I'm alive.

433
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,600
 Like that's the evidence that God actually has imbued me very distinctly, very

434
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,280
 uniquely to be who I am.

435
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,280
 And it says so in the Bible, like Genesis chapter two, it says in verse seven, then

436
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,680
 the Lord God formed the man of the dust from the ground.

437
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,160
 And guess what?

438
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,240
 He breathed into his nostrils, the breath of life.

439
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
 And this is what's crazy.

440
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,000
 The man became a Nefesh, became a living creature.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
 That's the Hebrew.

442
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,000
 You see, you don't have a soul.

443
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
 You are a soul.

444
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
 Like you are a soul.

445
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
 Your soul is from God almighty.

446
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,480
 And it is for you personally.

447
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,720
 Like it's representative of your being and your essence and your soul is like any

448
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,600
 other soul in the entire cosmos.

449
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,800
 Like you are one of a kind.

450
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,640
 You are a unique combination of personality and ability and destiny.

451
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
 And because you're a unique combination of those three things, there is no one else

452
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,240
 like you anywhere else in all the world.

453
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,360
 It's fascinating.

454
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,080
 Like people spend incredible amounts of money on rare art.

455
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
 Salvatore Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci.

456
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's over $450 million.

457
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,760
 Interchanged by Willem de Kooning went for $300 million.

458
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,160
 The card players by Paul Cezanne sold for $250 million.

459
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,280
 Why?

460
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,920
 Because they were crafted by some of the greats.

461
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,160
 And they are one of a kind themselves.

462
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,640
 Porch, listen to me.

463
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,000
 You have been crafted by the greatest of all time.

464
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,240
 And you are one of a kind.

465
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,760
 There's no one like you.

466
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,840
 And the price on your head is the price of Christ's blood.

467
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 And that is an immeasurable value.

468
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
 That is a priceless determination.

469
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
 That's what God wants you to know.

470
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
 He wants you to love him with your soul.

471
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,680
 Psalm 139, 13 through 14 says, "For you, God, form my inward parts.

472
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,720
 You knit me together in my mother's womb.

473
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,160
 I praise you.

474
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,040
 I'm fearfully and I'm wonderfully made.

475
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,680
 Wonderful are your works.

476
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,080
 Catch it.

477
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,440
 My soul knows it very well."

478
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,560
 So when Jesus says that you should love the Lord with all your soul, he's saying

479
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,120
 that you should love God with whatever unique combination he's given you.

480
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,120
 And I think this is going to be a massive point for some of you here tonight,

481
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,800
 because some of you need to simply know.

482
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:30,560
 It is not possible for you to love God with all your soul while indulging some sort

483
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,680
 of insecurity that you hate about yourself.

484
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,800
 Some of you are so dissatisfied by the way God's made you.

485
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,760
 And because you're willing to entertain that dissatisfaction, you'll never be able

486
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,080
 to love him with all your soul.

487
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,640
 Like whatever part of you that you feel insecure about or embarrassed by,

488
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,760
 whatever part of your design you wish you could change.

489
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
 I hate this about myself.

490
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,080
 Like your body shape or your personal interests or the background and family you

491
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,520
 come from or the social quirks that always pop up at the worst possible time.

492
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,640
 And you just play the tape over and over and over again whenever you leave those

493
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,760
 conversations, because I'm so stupid to say that.

494
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,920
 Why did I do that thing?

495
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,680
 Whenever that happens for you, what you need to know is it's not possible to

496
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
 indulge that insecurity and love God with all your soul at the same time.

497
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,400
 Like for some of us tonight, the most loving thing you can do is stop

498
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,800
 criticizing yourself.

499
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,520
 Start embracing who God made you to be.

500
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,440
 Start trusting with what he's doing in your life and start living into the story

501
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
 that he's writing already.

502
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,520
 That's the best thing you could do.

503
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,000
 But it starts with some of you embracing who you are.

504
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 This is my story.

505
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,280
 Played for years by self-hate.

506
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,720
 And yet I know I can't love God with all my soul if I continue to indulge that.

507
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,000
 Instead, I must embrace who God's made me to be because who you are is from God and

508
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,920
 who you're becoming is for God.

509
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,760
 Like this is big.

510
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,600
 You don't get to live according to your personal preferences.

511
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,440
 You don't get to live according to the preferences of other people.

512
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,760
 According to God's word, you get to live according to his preferences.

513
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,800
 And that's good news because he prefers you to be exactly who he's made you to be.

514
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,520
 That's his preference.

515
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,720
 His preference is I made you like this.

516
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,040
 I want you like this.

517
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,640
 And I'm not only going to leave you where you are, I'm making you into the one that I

518
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,520
 want you to be.

519
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:33,280
 One that conforms with my will, that aligns with my word, that looks the epitome of what

520
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,480
 I intended at original creation.

521
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,160
 I'm leading us back to Eden.

522
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,240
 And I'm going to make you right.

523
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
 You have to love him with your soul.

524
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,280
 He also wants you to love him with your mind because a love for God is perceptive of

525
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,960
 reality.

526
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,240
 Love for God is perceptive of reality.

527
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,080
 That's our third point.

528
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,360
 Now, it's typical to hear that whenever we're supposed to love God with more of our

529
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,040
 mind, we think that that equates to just thinking more about him, learning more about

530
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,360
 who he is, learning more about what he does.

531
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,040
 That's not exactly what Jesus is saying here.

532
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,520
 To be fair, we should learn more about God, but we're not supposed to simply learn more

533
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
 about him.

534
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 What we learn about him should influence the way that we look at life.

535
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,880
 What we learn influences the way that we look like.

536
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,840
 The goal is not just to know more about God.

537
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,960
 The goal is to do more with what I know about God.

538
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,640
 That's what he's working on.

539
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,960
 And as you do with what you know, as you live according to what you've learned, he's

540
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,240
 going to continue to put more deposits into your life because he does want you to know

541
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
 as much of him as possible.

542
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,840
 It's less about what you know.

543
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,560
 It's more about how you live in light of what you know.

544
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,520
 It's like an Indiana Jones in the last crusade.

545
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,720
 When faced with seemingly impossible odds and a great chasm between himself and the

546
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,320
 Holy Grail, all hope seemed lost for our hero.

547
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:10,200
 Indy stood there amidst a great canyon with no way across, his father held captive by

548
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,640
 the dreaded Nazis and time running out.

549
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,440
 And yet in that moment, when it seemed like there was no way, he remembered the words

550
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,520
 of his father from his own notebook that there in the midst of that chasm, lied an

551
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,440
 invisible landing.

552
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
 And so Indy did what?

553
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 He took what he knew and he applied it to his life and he was able to perceive the

554
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,160
 imperceivable step off the chasm.

555
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:49,520
 Into the abyss, yet land upon an invisible bridge, race across and save the day.

556
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,680
 What do we learn from that story?

557
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,480
 Because in the same way, we are meant to take what we know to be true, not from Dr.

558
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,320
 Jones diary, but from the Bible and we're meant to apply it to our life.

559
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,960
 You see the word of God, it's like a light to our minds.

560
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,080
 That's what the scriptures say.

561
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,920
 The thing about light is light doesn't change anything about reality.

562
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,600
 What it does is it reveals what's actually real.

563
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,960
 That's what the word of God does.

564
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,680
 That's what Psalm 119 tells us in verse 105.

565
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,120
 It says, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

566
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,720
 Like, have you ever considered that there is more reality to this world than you may

567
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,440
 well perceive?

568
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
 Have you ever thought about that?

569
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,280
 Like things may not be exactly as you think.

570
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,120
 Like there may be more reality that is just not yet perceived by you.

571
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,200
 Have you ever considered that?

572
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,520
 Because that's an idea that the biblical authors were really well acquainted with.

573
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
 Like they were comfortable with this idea of mystery and the fact that things didn't

574
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 look exactly as they were.

575
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,680
 And yet the way they were able to act, they were able to act, like act into, live into,

576
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,840
 be a part of real reality is they increased their understanding of who God was and what

577
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,640
 God said.

578
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,120
 They filled their minds with his word.

579
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,520
 And we have to do the same things because God's words bring clarity to true reality.

580
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,720
 That's why as we follow Jesus, we read his word daily, often, frequently.

581
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,240
 You read his word, not because I have to, but because he's trying to teach you.

582
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,920
 And as you read his word, you ask good questions and you find friends to process with,

583
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,720
 and you don't give up whenever it gets hard.

584
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,120
 That's what Paul describes in Romans chapter 12.

585
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,560
 Like the product of it is amazing because in Romans 12 too, it says, "Do not be conformed

586
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,640
 to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."

587
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,400
 How does it happen?

588
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,920
 Looking into, peering into the mysteries of God, reading his word, learning who he is,

589
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,440
 understanding his will, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is

590
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
 good and acceptable and perfect.

591
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,400
 You see, we love God with our minds when we aspire to see the world as it should be seen.

592
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:13,680
 And the only way to see the world as it should be seen is through the eyes of the one who

593
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
 rightly sees it.

594
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,120
 So I remember early in my ministry career, I think it was my first year actually, so

595
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,640
 stressed out, anxious, couldn't get a break.

596
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,920
 Felt like I was failing at everything that I put my hands to.

597
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
 And I just was praying.

598
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,680
 I was like, I don't know what else to do.

599
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,600
 I've hit my last resort.

600
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
 I was just praying.

601
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,880
 I was like, God, help me to be more patient.

602
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,400
 Help me to be more understanding.

603
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,240
 Give me God wisdom to navigate these difficulties.

604
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,120
 And Lord, would you help me to be more loving to my coworkers?

605
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,280
 God, I'm jealous of that guy.

606
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,040
 Would you help me to be forgiving and acceptable and empathetic towards him?

607
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,720
 God, would you help me?

608
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,920
 And just felt like everything I was praying is like, God, here's one more problem.

609
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,880
 God, here's one more problem.

610
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,640
 Please help me with this.

611
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,680
 Lord, help me, help me, help me.

612
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,640
 Like that's everything I felt like I was praying in this moment.

613
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,960
 And I was so overwhelmed.

614
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:03,520
 And I was like, God, what is the one prayer I can pray to cover all the other prayers?

615
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,880
 You know, like what's the easiest way for me to just say everything I got to say?

616
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
 Cause I don't know that I'm going to get through all of it right now.

617
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,000
 You ever been in that spot?

618
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,640
 Here's the prayer you pray.

619
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,600
 God, would you help me to see you clearly?

620
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,760
 Because in seeing you clearly, I will see everything else as a result.

621
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,040
 That's it.

622
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,360
 That's the prayer.

623
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,040
 Now, in the moment I was just making a last ditch effort and grabbing something that felt good.

624
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,120
 But what's been amazing is I've walked with the Lord and I've studied his word.

625
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,400
 I've realized that that is a timeless truth that is encased in the greatest command.

626
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
 That's how you love the Lord with your mind.

627
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:53,640
 You see, you love the Lord with your mind by seeing how he sees.

628
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,280
 And you see how he sees by seeing into Jesus.

629
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,840
 Because when you see as Jesus sees, you don't withdraw from conflict.

630
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,360
 No, you seek peace instead.

631
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,040
 Like when you see as Jesus sees, you don't just spend money because I've got it and I can just put it out.

632
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,160
 No, like you save your money and you steward it for the benefit of yourself and as a blessing to other people.

633
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,720
 When you see as Jesus sees, you don't just get pent up with frustration because things aren't going the way you want.

634
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,760
 You trust that the Lord's in control and he actually does have your good in mind.

635
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,800
 Like when you see as Jesus sees, you don't view people that are different than you as a person to be avoided.

636
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,600
 You see them as a person worthy of being welcomed.

637
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,800
 This is what it means to see as Jesus sees.

638
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,240
 That's why God wants us to love him with our minds.

639
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,920
 This is crazy.

640
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,920
 God doesn't just want you to just think about him more, to just know a bunch of stuff.

641
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,000
 No, he knows.

642
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,680
 Hey, if you fill your thoughts with thoughts of me and if you see as I see, you won't only see me more clearly.

643
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,480
 You're going to see true reality the way it's meant to be seen.

644
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,920
 That's a really generous invitation.

645
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:14,200
 God wants you to see the world as fully and capably as possible.

646
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,240
 But the way that happens is you love him with your mind.

647
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,080
 That's it.

648
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:26,600
 And then the fourth and final thing that Jesus teaches us is that love for others is reflective of ourselves.

649
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,000
 Love for others is reflective of ourselves.

650
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,240
 22 verse 39 says, "And a second is like it.

651
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,720
 You shall love your neighbor as yourself."

652
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
 Now, this is easily one of the most well-known verses in all of the Bible.

653
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,920
 But I also think it's easily one of the most misunderstood verses in all the Bible.

654
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:58,200
 Because, see, so often whenever we read this and because we know our Bible so well, we think, well, we're supposed to be humble.

655
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,640
 We're supposed to die to self and we shouldn't think more highly of ourselves than we ought.

656
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,320
 And the greatest among you shall be your servant.

657
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,880
 The first shall be last and the last shall be first.

658
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,280
 And we should look to the interests of others.

659
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,760
 And you should give even a grace cost to yourself.

660
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:17,960
 And because we know the Bible so well, we hear what we think Jesus is saying as opposed to actually listening to what Jesus is truly saying.

661
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,120
 So what's he saying?

662
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,720
 Is he saying, "Stop loving yourself.

663
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,320
 Start loving other people."

664
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
 No, that would be wrong.

665
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,680
 You see, this verse is not saying that you should love your neighbor instead of yourself.

666
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,040
 This verse is not saying you should love your neighbor in place of yourself.

667
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,720
 This verse is not saying you should love your neighbor more than yourself.

668
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,840
 That's not what this verse is saying.

669
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,360
 It's saying you should love your neighbor as yourself.

670
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,920
 Meaning God's expectation of you is that you do love yourself.

671
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
 That you do love yourself.

672
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,120
 And the way you love yourself directly influences the way you love other people.

673
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,160
 It does not give any license for egotism and pride and self-seeking.

674
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,360
 The Bible, it decries that idea in so many other places.

675
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,000
 But that's not what this particular verse is saying.

676
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
 It is saying, "No, there is a way that you are supposed to love yourself.

677
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,200
 And it's so important to get that right because it directly impacts the way you're supposed to love other people."

678
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,080
 This is the second greatest command.

679
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,880
 So how are we supposed to love ourselves?

680
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,600
 Well, it's like an age-old leadership lesson.

681
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,120
 Don't expect of others what you won't expect of yourself.

682
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,480
 So I remember learning this very early in my ministry career.

683
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,560
 We had a director on our team who was the definition of hardworking.

684
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,760
 Like he was the guy that was super reliable and he always came through in the clutch.

685
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,120
 And he was the one that when he walked in the room, you just breathed a sigh of relief.

686
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,560
 Like, "Oh my God, thank goodness Brent is here."

687
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,360
 Like you would just feel so much relief because he would come into the room because he was on your team.

688
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,760
 And yet one thing always stood out to me about this guy in particular.

689
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,400
 He would always announce at the end of the workday, 4.30 p.m., that, "I'm going home, everybody.

690
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,280
 And you should go home too."

691
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,440
 Which just stood out to me as really weird.

692
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,680
 Like this is one of the top dogs in our organization.

693
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,240
 And yet he's telling us to go home?

694
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,800
 No, no, no, no.

695
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,120
 Like that, that, that doesn't feel right.

696
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,360
 This feels like a test.

697
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,720
 And so I refused to do what Brent said.

698
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:41,080
 Instead, I decided to make sure that I put on another pot of coffee, got back to work, was the last one out of the building.

699
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,480
 That is until eventually he called me into his office and he asked me why I was doing that.

700
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,400
 And then he proceeded to tell me why he left at 4.30 every day.

701
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,960
 He told me this, he said, "Kylin, I can't take care of our team if I don't take care of myself.

702
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,680
 And I leave at 4.30 because it's good for me.

703
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,520
 And I want you to leave at 4.30 because it's good for you too."

704
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,240
 Now, did Brent always leave at 4.30?

705
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,880
 No.

706
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
 Whenever the job required, he'd stay late.

707
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,240
 Whenever the job required, I would stay late.

708
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,320
 But what he was communicating to me is exactly what Jesus is communicating in this moment.

709
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,040
 Brent was literally loving me as he loved himself.

710
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:32,960
 That he wanted for my good in the same way that he wanted for his own good, in a way that believed what God said about him.

711
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,520
 Like, I wanted to stay at the office and work real hard because I wanted to prove that I brought value to the organization.

712
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,400
 And yet Brent knew my value isn't found in the way I work.

713
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
 My value is in what Jesus Christ has done for me.

714
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,760
 Like, all of my value is wrapped up in the cross, in the work that Christ has done, not the work that I can do.

715
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,720
 And yet that's the most liberating thing because whenever he knows that and whenever we know that, it empowers us to love people radically.

716
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,760
 Like, that's the issue here.

717
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,080
 You see, God wants you to love yourself so that way you can adequately love other people.

718
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,760
 And yet where we often get into trouble is we're not very good at loving ourselves.

719
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,800
 Like, newsflash, you're actually not very good at it.

720
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
 I'm not very good at it.

721
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,760
 Like, some of us can't love others because we don't find ourselves lovable.

722
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:31,760
 Like, you're dissatisfied with how you look in the mirror or you're consumed with what people think of you or you constantly talk down to yourself because it's how your parents only ever spoke to you or you're embarrassed by your job.

723
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,000
 You feel shame for what you did in college or in that relationship or to that friend.

724
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,920
 And you don't feel like you fit in to whatever room you're a part of for whatever reason.

725
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:49,720
 If this is you, listen, you will not be able to love your neighbor because you cannot love yourself.

726
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,880
 Like, you won't be able to celebrate other people because they have what you want.

727
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,240
 Like, you won't be able to serve other people because you don't feel worthy.

728
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,560
 You won't be able to see people that are hurting because all you see is your own hurt.

729
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,880
 That's why it's so important for you to learn how to love yourself because it's going to empower you to love other people.

730
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,200
 But if you don't find yourself lovable, you will not be able to do it.

731
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,680
 For others, we can't love others because we do a poor job of loving ourselves.

732
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,600
 It's not that we don't find ourselves lovable.

733
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,760
 It's that we do a really poor job of loving ourselves.

734
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,280
 Like, you don't pursue God's best for you.

735
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,720
 Instead, you pursue whatever feels good for you.

736
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 Like, you just want to feel desired.

737
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,640
 And so you lower your standards to get some attention.

738
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,000
 Or you just need to unwind, even if it means that you've got to have another drink, another vape.

739
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,880
 Like, you so badly want empathy from people that you vent about that problem.

740
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,040
 You vent about that person.

741
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,280
 You vent about your pain.

742
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,520
 And even though all that is so legitimate, the way in which you vent it, it doesn't help you.

743
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,320
 It only hurts you.

744
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
 It leaves you embittered.

745
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,280
 Some of you want so badly to feel accepted that you're even willing to compromise your own morals to make that happen.

746
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:18,480
 If it's you, if you're here and you're entertaining sin in your life, you're not alone.

747
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,880
 I've been there.

748
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,760
 We've been there.

749
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
 This is a part of the human story.

750
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,040
 And yet what you need to know is you won't be able to love others because you're doing a bad job of loving yourself.

751
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,760
 You see, sin wants you to think that you're helping yourself.

752
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,400
 I'm doing this, man.

753
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,000
 It feels good.

754
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Like, actually, I get a high off of it.

755
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,840
 Like, it's pleasant to my being.

756
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,320
 It gratifies my flesh.

757
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,960
 Like, it does feel nice.

758
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,720
 It masquerades as love.

759
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:01,640
 But in truth, when you rip off the mask, all it is is hate from an enemy that does not want your well-being.

760
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,800
 You see, you're entertaining the very things that Jesus Christ went to the cross to free you from.

761
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,920
 And for others of us, you can't love other people because you love yourself too much.

762
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,680
 You're too focused on where you want to be in life, what you want to achieve in the next five years,

763
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,520
 the kind of reputation you really want to be, the kind of reputation you really want to have, the sort of circle you want to be a part of,

764
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,440
 the kind of experiences you want to have in life.

765
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,720
 You won't be able to love others because all your time and all your space and all your energy, it's gone into loving you.

766
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,080
 The danger here, if it's you, is you won't be able to see others because you can't see past yourself.

767
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,240
 Like, you're too busy.

768
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,720
 You're too preoccupied with where you want to be in the future to see where God actually has you here in the present.

769
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,040
 Like, you're too proud.

770
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,920
 You're too concerned with being impressive one day that you miss what's important to God here today.

771
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,280
 You're so focused on your purposes that you're missing out on the purposes God has for you.

772
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,880
 And heads up, the purposes of God are so much better than any purpose you could ever design for yourself.

773
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,560
 Like, he wants to save the world.

774
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,920
 That's amazing.

775
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,160
 That's why Jesus is calling people to follow him, to be his disciple.

776
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,120
 Hey, I'm saving the world.

777
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,280
 I'm doing a good thing and I want you to do it too.

778
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,240
 That's a purpose worth living for.

779
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,480
 That's a purpose far greater than anything we could draw up for ourself.

780
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,160
 And yet the way he does it is he saves the world one person at a time.

781
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,240
 And he wants to use you to do it.

782
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,560
 But the only way it's done is by loving others rightly.

783
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,840
 And the only way we love others rightly is we love ourselves rightly first.

784
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,480
 Now, listen to me, and I need this to be really clear because some of you are listening to this and you're like, this feels really heretical.

785
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,120
 Like some of you are sitting here like, no, I don't know that that's what it's teaching.

786
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,920
 I'm not preaching a self-care gospel just to be abundantly clear.

787
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,200
 Like, I'm not telling you that you just need to think more positive thoughts.

788
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,480
 And you know what?

789
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,480
 You really should complain about the commitments you have and find a way to get out of them.

790
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,400
 You really should get more vacation time.

791
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,000
 I can't believe they're holding out on you.

792
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,760
 You need to eat a healthier diet.

793
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,840
 That's going to make you more, more, more blessed in life.

794
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,040
 I'm not saying any of that.

795
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,280
 I'm not preaching a self-care gospel, but I am preaching to you the real gospel, which is a soul care gospel.

796
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,000
 That's what the gospel is.

797
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,440
 It's God saw your soul and it was condemned.

798
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,600
 And he said, I'm coming in to save it because I want you for myself.

799
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
 I'm going to save your soul.

800
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,000
 And yet so many of us condemn our soul by way of doing things that we know we should not do.

801
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,160
 And yet the way that you love yourself rightly is you love yourself as Christ himself has loved you.

802
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,440
 But that's it.

803
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,560
 How has Christ loved you?

804
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,120
 Like he's gone to the cross on your behalf.

805
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,600
 He's endured the wrath of God in your place.

806
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,120
 And so what that means for us is, is I can love myself enough to forgive myself.

807
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,000
 I can love myself enough to accept myself.

808
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,480
 I can love myself enough to not give up on myself because Jesus Christ never gave up on me.

809
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:20,200
 I can love myself enough to celebrate the fact that God is out of his mind going crazy that you placed your faith in him.

810
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,520
 He loves that.

811
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,880
 All of all of heaven rejoices at the salvation of a single sinner.

812
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,920
 And so since God celebrates me, I can celebrate me too.

813
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,600
 I can love myself enough to hold myself to a higher standard.

814
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,520
 That's the Christian life.

815
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,840
 God does have a standard that he is calling us to.

816
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,120
 He does want us to walk in that way because that's the way of Jesus.

817
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,680
 And so I can love myself enough to go that way.

818
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,520
 I can love myself enough to believe we have purposes in life.

819
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:55,400
 First John 4, 9, 10 says, "In this, the love of God was manifest among us.

820
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,640
 That God sent his only son into the world so that we might live through it.

821
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,880
 In this is the love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation of our sins.

822
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,280
 Beloved, if God so loved us, then guess what?

823
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,160
 We also ought to love one another.

824
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,520
 No one's ever seen God.

825
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,680
 But if we love God, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.

826
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:37,440
 Put simply, we love the Lord because he's loved us and we love one another because he loved us.

827
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,400
 And the reason we know it is because Jesus loved us with all his heart.

828
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,760
 Like Jesus's own expression was to be perfect in our place.

829
00:46:50,760 --> 00:47:01,360
 Jesus loved us with all his soul. His distinction as the son of God was laid aside that he might become the son of suffering.

830
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:09,480
 He loved us with all his mind, like his perception was of a reality we knew not of.

831
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,440
 His perception was of a reality where we could be in relationship with God forever.

832
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,400
 None of us knew that.

833
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,280
 We were darkened in the understanding of our mind.

834
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,000
 Yet as he stepped in light of the world, he brought clarity to reality and he said, no, you can be with me forever.

835
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,320
 And he loved us as himself.

836
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,320
 His reflection has made you and has made I children of God.

837
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,240
 This is the love of God for you.

838
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:43,800
 That's the power of what he's done and that power is found in Christ's love for us.

839
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,840
 So let me pray for us.

840
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,120
 God, thank you for tonight.

841
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,760
 We're so grateful for this evening and a chance to sit under your word.

842
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,600
 And God, I flew through this thing.

843
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:12,920
 But God, don't let my urgency cost these people in this room the intensity of what you're communicating.

844
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:22,800
 That you don't want this a life where they do a bunch of things, where they get active and they get to work.

845
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,160
 That's not your heart for them, God.

846
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,680
 No, your heart for them is that they would love you with all of their being.

847
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,400
 God, that they would love you with their heart.

848
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,000
 That they wouldn't just be obedient and begrudgingly submitted.

849
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,800
 But God, that they would desire you, that you would unlock something within them that loves you, God.

850
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,520
 That they would love you with their soul.

851
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,040
 They would embrace, God, who you've made them to be and who it is you're making them into.

852
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,520
 That God, they would love you with their mind.

853
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,480
 That they would learn about you and that learning would lead to new living.

854
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,200
 And that God, they would love others as themselves.

855
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,640
 That God, you have loved them very specifically.

856
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,120
 Thus, they should love themselves in light of that.

857
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,160
 And it should liberate them, God.

858
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,080
 It should unleash them, Lord, to make a big difference in the world and to love other people.

859
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,360
 This is your teaching, Jesus.

860
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,960
 The first and greatest command and the second just like it.

861
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,360
 Love me because I've loved you.

862
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,720
 It's in Jesus' name we pray.

863
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,040
 Amen.

864
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,200
 Hey, Ports, let's stand together, would you?

865
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,840
 We're really excited because the evening's not over.

866
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,120
 We're going to respond in worship.

867
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,840
 And every one of us in this moment has a response to take.

868
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,560
 And so you should know, we've got a team down to the front, my left and right.

869
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,800
 They'd love to pray with you if you want prayer, if you need processing, they're here for that.

870
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,280
 But let's sing together and celebrate the love that God has given.

871
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,340
 you
