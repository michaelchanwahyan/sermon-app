00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,420
 Hey, guys.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,400
 This is David Marvin.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,680
 I'm here with my friend Cody.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,400
 And we are so excited to tell you about something

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
 coming up tonight.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,720
 We are so excited to tell you about-- hey,

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,640
 this duster thing is tripping me out.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,720
 Can we just start again?

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,760
 David Marvin, I'm here with my friend Cody.

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
 We are here-- hey, mom, what's up?

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,640
 No, no, it's a great time.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,160
 OK, cut.

14
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
 She wants to talk to you, bro.

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,040
 I'm not talking to your mom.

16
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,240
 Cut.

17
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,520
 Just don't put it on your face.

18
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,600
 We're here to announce--

19
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,200
 That's right.

20
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,720
 The new iPhone is out.

21
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,640
 That's right, guys.

22
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
 That's not even the new iPhone.

23
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,440
 I'm under contract, all right?

24
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,600
 You can get your new iPhone out in the lobby.

25
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,240
 Just go ahead and get up, exit out.

26
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,360
 We're handing them out free, just for the purchase

27
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
 of five easy months.

28
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,520
 That's not the announcement.

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,200
 Tonight, we're here to announce this is the first night

30
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,920
 to register for launch, 2014.

31
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
 You don't want to miss it.

32
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
 It's going to be amazing.

33
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,080
 It's going to sell out.

34
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,640
 Shane and Shane will be there.

35
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,840
 Labor Day weekend, Jefferson Bethke, JR Vassar,

36
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,720
 all sons and daughters, Johnny and Chachi.

37
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,640
 '80s party.

38
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,600
 It's an '80s theme.

39
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,800
 Michael Jackson will be there.

40
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,440
 Michael Jackson's not coming in.

41
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,800
 We're shipping him in overnight.

42
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,760
 He's on us.

43
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
 He's not alive anymore.

44
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
 OK, his hologram's coming in.

45
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,880
 His hologram's not coming in.

46
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,380
 Beat it.

47
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,480
 OK, whatever.

48
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,160
 But I do need you to know that I did prepare something

49
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,480
 special for this night.

50
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,080
 Hit it, guys.

53
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:34,560
 She was more like a beauty queen from the movie scene.

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
 Baby, don't mind what you do to me.

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 I am the one who will dance on the floor and run.

56
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,440
 She told me, girl, it was Billie Jean.

57
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,920
 And she calls the scene.

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,800
 And every head turned with eyes that dream of being the one who

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,280
 will dance on the floor and run.

60
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,240
 People always told me, be careful what you do.

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,240
 Don't go around bringing young girls home.

62
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,320
 And mother always told me, don't go around bringing

63
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,800
 young girls home.

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 And mother always told me, be careful who you love.

65
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 Be careful what you do.

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 Because a lie becomes a truth.

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 Hey.
