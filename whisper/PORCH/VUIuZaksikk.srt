00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,640
 All right.

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,920
 Hey, it's porch day.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,400
 How we feeling?

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,840
 Yes.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880
 I feel similarly.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,360
 It's so good to be back.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,720
 You know, I look forward to every single Tuesday,

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,640
 and I'm so glad that you chose to be here with us.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,080
 We've also got some very special friends joining us

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,920
 from around the nation.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
 We have Porch Live locations tuning in,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,000
 and we want to give a special shout out to Porch Live Dayton

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,760
 and Porch Live Des Moines.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,560
 We love you guys.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,880
 Thanks so much for being here with us.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,800
 Hey, tonight we're starting a brand new series,

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,880
 and it's going to be great.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,080
 I'm excited about it.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,200
 But to kick things off, I just want to lead off with a story.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,120
 The beginning of this year, I found myself

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,200
 in the midst of the most stressful situation

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
 I've probably encountered in the last year or so.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,480
 My car decided to break down.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,760
 Very unexpectedly, something that I was not

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,400
 planning for at all-- you know, we're

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,280
 good stewards of our finances, and so we

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,680
 were saving up for the day when we would buy another one.

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,440
 But you know, my engine failed.

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,280
 And so it was time to buy a new vehicle.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,860
 And I needed to do it quick, because it

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,480
 was in the middle of our move to Dallas.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,560
 You know, whenever you transition tests, trials,

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
 they come a mini.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,280
 And so this was one of the many that we found ourselves facing.

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,640
 And so we decided, OK, we've got to find a car.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
 And so I immediately got to work.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,360
 I needed to find something that was easy on the pocketbook,

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,680
 that was reliable to drive, gently used, no damage at all.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,000
 And so I started hunting it down, you know?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
 And what you would expect, given that criteria,

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
 is that I was probably looking for a nice family sedan,

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,160
 a Toyota Corolla, you know, or a Honda Civic.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,000
 That's what your mind would naturally run to.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,520
 My mind's different.

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:23,360
 I naturally ran to a 1990s single cab Ford pickup truck.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
 You know?

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,620
 The heart wants what the heart wants,

49
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,620
 and that's what I wanted.

50
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,840
 And so I applied myself, man.

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,040
 Like, I put myself to the test.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,760
 I went to work trying to hunt down this unicorn of a vehicle.

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,400
 And what I found is that I was spending

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
 an obsessive amount of time on things

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,360
 like Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace, and AutoTrader.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,400
 Anywhere I could look, I was looking,

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,360
 because I wanted so desperately to find this truck.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
 It's the one thing that I wanted most of all.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,960
 And yet, no matter how hard I looked, I could not find it.

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,300
 At least not one that met the specs I needed.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,720
 Again, my criteria was I needed to be reliable.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,240
 I needed to have zero damage.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,120
 I need something that's somewhere less than 100,000

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,040
 miles, you know?

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
 And it needs to be easy on the pocketbook.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
 Like, there's a lot of trucks out there,

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,720
 but not many that are 34 years old that meet that criteria.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,080
 And so I wisened up, you know?

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,660
 And I decided, OK, I probably just need

70
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,000
 to change my search criteria.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,440
 I need to stop looking for trucks,

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,640
 and I need to start looking for nice family sedans.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,960
 And so within a matter of a couple of days, I found one.

74
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,000
 I found a 2010 Ford Fusion.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,760
 Yeah, man.

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,280
 It's OK.

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,680
 Save your pity laugh, pity applause.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,960
 It met my criteria, OK?

79
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
 66,000 miles.

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
 It was cheaper than dirt to buy.

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,360
 And I decided, OK, let me test drive the thing.

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,520
 Let me pick it up and get it mechanically inspected.

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,280
 I'll visit with the owner, and we can agree on a price.

84
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,440
 And it was all but a done deal.

85
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,440
 That is until I found this.

86
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,920
 [CHEERING]

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
 You can actually cheer for this one,

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,080
 because this met my search criteria.

89
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,840
 And so I bought it.

90
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,040
 [CHEERING]

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,440
 Now, how did I find this?

92
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,880
 Like, all hope was lost, you know?

93
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,240
 I had been on the hunt, working the grind,

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,600
 trying to find this thing to no avail.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,360
 So how did I actually find it?

96
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,280
 In the 11th hour, I persevered.

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,840
 When other men would have given up and settled

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,800
 for lesser glory, I decided to keep after it.

99
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,160
 And what I found was the one thing

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,440
 that I'd been seeking after.

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,920
 You see, I decided not to settle for just anything,

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,880
 but I persisted in seeking the one thing that was actually

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,480
 worthy of my wanting.

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
 Why do I tell you that tonight?

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,360
 Well, first, I really just wanted

106
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,560
 to show you my new truck.

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,080
 I'm really proud of it.

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,560
 And it is just as amazing as you would expect.

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
 But then, two, I share that with you,

110
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,200
 because God has told us of all the things

111
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,680
 that we could seek in this life--

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,240
 and there are many things that we could seek in this life.

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
 We could seek popularity.

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,120
 We could seek influence, approval, power, success,

115
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,280
 advancement.

116
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,000
 Of all the things we could seek, God

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 has made it clear that there is one thing worthy of seeking

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
 most of all.

119
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,800
 This is what he's revealed by way of his word.

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,440
 You see, he's told us there's something

121
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
 that should claim the top spot in our life, something

122
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
 that we should obsess to find.

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,520
 And tonight, he wants to reveal it to you and I.

124
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
 And the place that he does it is in Psalm chapter 27.

125
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
 So if you have a Bible, you can pull it out.

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,760
 You can turn with me to Psalm chapter 27

127
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,400
 while you're doing that.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
 Tonight, we're starting a brand new series called Essential,

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
 where we want to unpack what God claims to be--

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,520
 what God claims is the most important pursuit in your life.

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,840
 Like, amidst all the things in life

132
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 you could spend your time chasing,

133
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,080
 God wants to make clear what's the one thing you should

134
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
 spend your life chasing.

135
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,920
 That's what this series is all about.

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,760
 When you read through the Bible, there

137
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,720
 are five one-thing statements that

138
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,920
 help us to realize the one thing that brings everything

139
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
 else into focus.

140
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,840
 This is the goal of the series.

141
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,600
 It's to simplify your seeking after that

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
 which is most important.

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,640
 And so we see in Psalm 27, starting in verse 4,

144
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:06,240
 these words, "One thing have I asked of the Lord,

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,120
 that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house

146
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,920
 of the Lord all the days of my life,

147
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,280
 to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord,

148
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,520
 and to inquire in his temple."

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,480
 You see, at the time that David, who is the author of the Psalm,

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,440
 is writing out this Psalm, what we know

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,280
 is that most scholars believe David

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
 was fleeing through the wilderness from King Saul,

153
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
 which if you look at the record books,

154
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,800
 would have dated him somewhere between 22 and 30 years old.

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,360
 For reference, that would put David,

156
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
 the author of this Psalm, in this room.

157
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,080
 He's your age.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,400
 He's a young adult. And what he just said

159
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,960
 is something that feels comical to read.

160
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
 He just said, hey, there's one thing

161
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,320
 that I'm really after, one thing that I'm obsessing to find,

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,080
 one thing that I'm asking of God.

163
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
 And it feels comical because who in here would say

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,240
 there's only one thing you want God to help you out with?

165
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,520
 Nobody.

166
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,920
 Like I asked for more than one thing today from God already,

167
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
 and I'm the guy standing on stage.

168
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
 You know, like not a single one of us

169
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,600
 between 22 and 30 years old,

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,720
 identifying as young adults would sit here tonight

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,920
 and say, yeah, there's only one thing

172
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,520
 I really want from God.

173
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
 No, like in the sea of all our busyness,

174
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,520
 we need God for a lot.

175
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,120
 We want so much from God

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,960
 because of all it is that we're underneath.

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,040
 You see, the world is demanding your attention.

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,720
 But hear me on this.

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 Whatever you give your attention to is commanding your life.

180
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,400
 The world is demanding your attention.

181
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
 Hey, look over here, pay attention to me,

182
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,080
 pursue this thing instead.

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,120
 But whatever it is you give your attention to

184
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,880
 is commanding your life.

185
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,120
 It's like when you go grocery shopping.

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
 I was thinking about this earlier too.

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 It's the third grocery illustration

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,800
 I've used in three sermons.

189
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,040
 I need some new material.

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,720
 But when you go grocery shopping, what do you do?

191
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,400
 You walk in with a list prepared.

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
 Why?

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,560
 If you don't have a list,

194
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,480
 that's the quickest route to spending more money

195
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,000
 and gaining unwanted weight, right?

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,120
 Because everything in the store is saying,

197
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,520
 buy me, pick me up, put me in the car.

198
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 Like that's everything.

199
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,640
 It's all window shopping and window dressing.

200
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,680
 So you don't walk in there without a list.

201
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
 That would be foolish.

202
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,360
 You walk in prepared because you know

203
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,080
 everything in the store is going to demand my attention.

204
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,040
 And so since my attention commands my life,

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
 since it drives my decisions,

206
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,520
 let me determine in advance what my attention should go to,

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,760
 what is actually deserving of my priority.

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,520
 You see, if that's true,

209
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,480
 we should do ourselves the service of asking tonight,

210
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,040
 what is it that you're giving your attention away to?

211
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,560
 Like David's got one thing he's focusing on,

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 but what are the myriad of things,

213
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,760
 the multitude of things

214
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,240
 that you're actually giving yourself away to,

215
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,360
 that you're thinking about,

216
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,760
 that stirs up all the emotions you feel,

217
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
 that leaves you sleepless in the evening,

218
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
 that you wake up in the morning already thinking about,

219
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,280
 what are those things?

220
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,920
 Because those are the things

221
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,800
 that have already called for your attention.

222
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,120
 You see, David is telling us tonight,

223
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
 of all those things,

224
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,520
 there's one thing that's actually worthy

225
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640
 of paying attention to.

226
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
 And for him, as he says it here in verse four,

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,280
 it's to dwell in the house of the Lord

228
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,360
 all the days of your life.

229
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,000
 So you tell me I'm supposed to just go to church

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
 every single day for the rest of my life?

231
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,480
 No, that's not what David's talking about.

232
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,920
 It sounds like it because it is religious rhetoric.

233
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,960
 And yet what you need to know

234
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
 is when David talks about the house of the Lord,

235
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,800
 what he's talking about

236
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
 is he's talking about the tabernacle in his context.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,840
 It's where the presence of God dwelt.

238
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,400
 And so David is saying, hey,

239
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,160
 the tabernacle, where God's presence is,

240
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,080
 that's where I wanna be.

241
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,240
 I wanna give all of myself,

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,440
 my singular focus and my undivided pursuit

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,760
 to being in that place.

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,640
 That's where I wanna be.

245
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
 This is what David is pointing to.

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,320
 He is saying that God's presence is the priority.

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,840
 Like all David wants is to be near to God.

248
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
 He just wants to be close.

249
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,780
 He just wants to be close by.

250
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,620
 That's it.

251
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,280
 That's what he's pursuing for.

252
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,680
 And what we'll find as we read through this chapter

253
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,840
 is the guy's in the midst of trouble

254
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
 and hardship and difficulty.

255
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
 Like there's adversity all about him.

256
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,400
 He could ask for so many other things,

257
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,520
 deliverance, God, save me from my enemies, God.

258
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
 But he doesn't do that.

259
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,520
 Instead, what David does is he just says,

260
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
 God, I wanna be near to you.

261
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,480
 I wanna be close to you, God.

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,920
 My proximity, I can't get close enough.

263
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,520
 I just want to be as tied next to you as possible.

264
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,600
 This is the heart of David in this moment.

265
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,520
 And he wants it so bad that he starts speaking in extremes.

266
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
 Like he's that friend that's like,

267
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,200
 oh, there's one thing that I ask.

268
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,300
 And I want it all the days of my life.

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,060
 Like David, why so dramatic, bro?

270
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,080
 Like, calm down, man.

271
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,000
 I mean, we get it.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 You want this, but you don't need to exaggerate.

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,760
 And yet he's not speaking in extremes needlessly.

274
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,080
 David, he speaks in extremes because he has good reason,

275
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
 which he wants to give to you and me.

276
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,360
 Namely two reasons for why we should seek

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
 the presence of God,

278
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,440
 why we should increase our proximity to him.

279
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,760
 And they're both in verse four.

280
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
 So read it with me again.

281
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,580
 One thing I seek to dwell in the house of the Lord

282
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,800
 all the days of my life.

283
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
 Why?

284
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,300
 To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord

285
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,620
 and to inquire in his temple.

286
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,600
 You see, the first reason David wants to draw near

287
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
 to the presence of God is to see God's beauty.

288
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
 That's the first reason.

289
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,640
 Reason number one,

290
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,680
 we seek to get as close to God as possible

291
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,160
 is to see God's beauty.

292
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,640
 So years ago, I worked for a ministry in College Station,

293
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,520
 obviously hand in hand with a bunch of college students.

294
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
 And what you find when you work with college students

295
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,200
 is they are navigating some of the biggest life decisions

296
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,840
 they will make.

297
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,960
 Over the course of a four year, five year spread,

298
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
 they are making huge decisions.

299
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
 Decisions like, what do I want to do

300
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
 with the rest of my life?

301
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,760
 Where do I want to live for my first job?

302
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,120
 What year am I going to graduate?

303
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,720
 And with what degree am I going to do so?

304
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
 Who are going to be my friends?

305
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,480
 Likely the people that may or may not stand in my wedding.

306
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
 Am I going to have a wedding?

307
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,100
 Am I going to get married?

308
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,880
 Am I going to meet that person here?

309
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 And they're navigating all these major life decisions.

310
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,820
 And if there was always one that came up

311
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,540
 that was most interesting to me,

312
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,200
 and it was this, it was the topic of dating.

313
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
 You see, because most of the guys that I was mentoring,

314
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,020
 they would inevitably come across some young lady

315
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,480
 that they were interested in.

316
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,160
 And so whenever this would happen,

317
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
 when I would find out that one of my guys

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
 had an interest in someone,

319
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,560
 another interest in a girl,

320
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,400
 what I would do is I would spring into action.

321
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 I would unload a set of carefully crafted

322
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,760
 and meticulously perfected questions

323
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,200
 that I had prepared over a long period of time.

324
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,240
 The first of which is really simple.

325
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,100
 What's her name?

326
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,420
 (congregation laughing)

327
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,520
 The second, how do you know her?

328
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:14,140
 Of all the places.

329
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,960
 Instagram.

330
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,340
 Like that was often the answer I received from these guys.

331
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,820
 They would tell me, yeah, yeah, I met her on Instagram.

332
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,100
 What are you talking about?

333
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,900
 You met her on Instagram.

334
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,340
 Like I understand if it's virtual dating,

335
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,780
 because those people,

336
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,420
 whether it's a dating app or something other,

337
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,260
 they've romantically self-selected that they're viable

338
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,100
 and they're interested.

339
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,220
 They're looking for suitors, partners.

340
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,060
 But on Instagram, like it's the wild west.

341
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,180
 Just shooting your shot off, you know,

342
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,360
 sliding into DMs and just trying to see

343
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,520
 what will actually hit.

344
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,620
 Doesn't seem like the best strategy, my guy.

345
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,740
 And yet this is what my boys were doing so often.

346
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,900
 They were finding people they were interested in

347
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,840
 and they were just making instinctive moves.

348
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,260
 And so it would always lead me to my third question.

349
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,300
 Well, what do you know about her?

350
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,060
 This is when the nerves really sink in.

351
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,200
 You know, like you could just see them,

352
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,580
 they kind of squirm in their seat,

353
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,660
 because oftentimes they would come up

354
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,100
 with some combination of,

355
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,460
 well, I mean, like she's got,

356
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,420
 there's a Bible verse in her bio

357
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,460
 and there's photos of her at a coffee shop.

358
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,820
 And it seems like she's got really good friends

359
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,080
 from the pictures I can see,

360
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,660
 as if this was a suitable resume for a romantic pursuit,

361
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,200
 which brought me to my fourth and final question.

362
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,240
 You just think she's pretty, don't you?

363
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,980
 To which often the case was yes.

364
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,580
 Why do I tell you that?

365
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,720
 Well, first, because I can't speak to the success rate

366
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
 of sliding into someone's DMs.

367
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,540
 But what I can say from that experiment

368
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,900
 is that external beauty may spark your interest,

369
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,920
 but internal beauty will keep your attention.

370
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,920
 External beauty, it may spark your interest,

371
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,220
 but internal beauty will keep your attention.

372
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,780
 You see, for my guys, and the same happens for girls,

373
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,480
 if you put the shoe on the other foot,

374
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,260
 many of them walk into date number one so excited,

375
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,300
 and then they walk out of date number one so disappointed.

376
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,140
 Why, why is that the case?

377
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,820
 Because though they liked what they initially saw,

378
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,820
 they learned that without character, intrinsic beauty,

379
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,700
 the relationship had no staying power.

380
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,180
 Why do I bring that up to us tonight?

381
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,740
 Because David, in this scripture,

382
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,580
 has seen something in God that not only sparked his interest

383
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,900
 but kept his attention.

384
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,420
 He saw in God an intrinsic beauty, a character,

385
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,500
 a nature that held him arrested,

386
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,000
 and he couldn't get away from.

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,800
 So let me ask you this, what makes something beautiful?

388
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,660
 Well, there's an old saying

389
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,560
 that beauty is in the eye of the beholder,

390
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,700
 which just simply means that beauty is subjective,

391
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,740
 to which I would agree.

392
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,740
 I'd say, yeah, of course, beauty is subjective

393
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,740
 in all areas of life but one, God.

394
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,600
 God is not subjectively beautiful.

395
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,440
 He is objectively beautiful.

396
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,660
 You see, the beauty of God is not determined

397
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,100
 by what you see of him but how much of him you see.

398
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,380
 Now, as I say that, here's what I know.

399
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,360
 I know that there are people in the room tonight

400
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,640
 that hear me say that

401
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,860
 and just have this impulse of skepticism.

402
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,620
 Like, you're sitting here and you've heard me say,

403
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,460
 God's objectively beautiful.

404
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,280
 You're like, well, man,

405
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,360
 you must know a different God than I do.

406
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,600
 Like, the God you've seen is not the same God that I've seen

407
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,740
 because I'm dealing with past hurts

408
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,440
 that I'm still trying to heal from.

409
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,500
 I'm carrying around scars, the likes of which

410
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,860
 I never would have inflicted and yet am enduring.

411
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,200
 I'm working through a pain

412
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,920
 that cannot seem to be put to rest.

413
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,040
 So this God that you say is so beautiful,

414
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,840
 he may be beautiful to you

415
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
 but he's not been beautiful to me, Kyla.

416
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,400
 To you, I would tell you

417
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 what one of my seminary professors said.

418
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,960
 And I quote,

419
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,680
 "If God did not allow bad things to happen,"

420
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
 and you need to hear that,

421
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,320
 not cause them to happen but allow them to happen.

422
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,680
 "If God did not allow bad things to happen,

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,260
 "how much of God would we then not know?

424
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,880
 "For without evil, we do not know God's grace.

425
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,900
 "Without agony, we do not know God's peace.

426
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,480
 "Without despair, we do not know God's joy.

427
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,100
 "Without hurt, we do not know God's healing.

428
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,360
 "Without death, we do not know God's gift of life."

429
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,240
 Friends, listen to me.

430
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,640
 The greatest good in all the world

431
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,200
 is to see as much of God as possible.

432
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,160
 But hear me on this.

433
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,800
 Such sight is impossible without the presence of pain.

434
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,120
 You cannot see all of him

435
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,640
 without the presence of pain.

436
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,200
 I tell you that as someone that has lived through suffering

437
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
 and stands on the other side of it,

438
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
 never wishing to go back,

439
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,260
 and yet so thankful God took me there.

440
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,080
 You see, God will lead you into places

441
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,280
 you would never go

442
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,740
 to show you things you would never see.

443
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,560
 He wants to show you as much of himself as possible.

444
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,440
 That is the greatest good, and he knows that's the case,

445
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,240
 so he's bringing you into it.

446
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,640
 And what's amazing is David, as we said,

447
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,980
 is deeply afflicted in this Psalm.

448
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,280
 If the scholars are right, he is on the run for his life,

449
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,280
 and yet his response is not to distance himself from God,

450
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,480
 it's to draw near to God.

451
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,640
 God, I wanna be close to you.

452
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,080
 That's the one thing I need.

453
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,480
 I don't need rescue or relief from all my circumstances.

454
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
 I just need to be near to you, God.

455
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
 That's his response.

456
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,280
 So if you're here tonight in that sort of place,

457
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,640
 if you're in that spot, what's your response?

458
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,480
 David has given you good reason to seek his presence

459
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,240
 because God is beautiful.

460
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,000
 But not only that,

461
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,300
 God is also knowable,

462
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,260
 which is the second reason David gives us

463
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,640
 that he seeks the presence of God.

464
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,480
 It's to see the beauty of God,

465
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,680
 and it's to know God personally.

466
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,640
 This is the second reason David gives.

467
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,720
 It says in verse four that part of his reason

468
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,120
 for dwelling in the house of the Lord

469
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,440
 was to inquire in God's temple.

470
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,880
 If you go and you read the Hebrew,

471
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,620
 that word for inquire is a word

472
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,840
 that doesn't just mean to casually know about someone.

473
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,080
 It means to closely, intimately, personally

474
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,960
 know someone or something.

475
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,800
 David wants to have a face-to-face relationship with God.

476
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,740
 How do you know someone's face closely?

477
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,860
 Not by standing across the room from them,

478
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,080
 but by getting near to them.

479
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,200
 That's what David wants.

480
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
 He knows, "God, I can know you,

481
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,680
 "but the best way for me to increase in that end

482
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,740
 "is to come close by.

483
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,720
 "I can know you, God, and it's that that I want."

484
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,980
 So something you should know about me

485
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,720
 is I have a wildly obsessive personality.

486
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
 I joke all the time.

487
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,320
 If you wanna know what I'm interested in,

488
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,640
 if you wanna know what my thought life

489
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,520
 currently consists of,

490
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
 you should just go to my YouTube page

491
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,640
 and look at whatever the algorithm is recommending

492
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,320
 because they've got me pinned down pretty well.

493
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,720
 And typically, because I'm not a mile wide and inch deep,

494
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,840
 but I'm very narrow and very deep

495
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,700
 on the things I'm interested in,

496
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,860
 you can get an idea of what I'm currently obsessing over.

497
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,240
 So I looked it up.

498
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
 I'm bringing you in.

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,440
 Don't judge me.

500
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,360
 But in no particular order, here are the results.

501
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,100
 Those things which currently have my mind's eye.

502
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,200
 The first is golf.

503
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,440
 Specifically, how not to slice my driver.

504
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 I'm working on that one.

505
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
 Number two, Gordon Ramsay.

506
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,080
 (congregation laughing)

507
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,000
 Do with that what you want.

508
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,060
 I'm a Renaissance man.

509
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,880
 Number three, mid-sized truck reviews.

510
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,340
 (congregation laughing)

511
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,860
 Because now I own one.

512
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,560
 And then lastly, and I don't know how to feel about this.

513
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,740
 You know, this is what happens

514
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
 when it's late in the evening

515
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,640
 and you just find yourself stuck on YouTube

516
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,160
 and then you can't get away from it.

517
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,020
 It's the black hole known as golden buzzer moments

518
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,480
 from America's Got Talent.

519
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
 (congregation laughing)

520
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,620
 You've been there.

521
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,600
 That's it.

522
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,220
 Like that's what my thought life consists of right now.

523
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,320
 Why do I tell you that?

524
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,180
 Because that is what I'm inquiring to know.

525
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,680
 That's what I'm obsessing over.

526
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,240
 Like that's what I want to learn as much about as possible

527
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
 in the same, but much more righteous way,

528
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,160
 David is doing that with God.

529
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,920
 Like David's YouTube feed is filled up

530
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,720
 with only videos of God.

531
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,920
 He just wants to learn as much as he can about the Lord.

532
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,520
 Like he knows, God, you are knowable.

533
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,080
 If that's true, then I want to know as much as possible.

534
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,100
 Like who is like you, God?

535
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,200
 Like no one is like you, Lord.

536
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,320
 Like, think about it like this.

537
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,840
 Like I was processing this idea.

538
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,040
 Like if there was someone in the world

539
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,080
 that you could spend every single day

540
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,960
 for the rest of your life learning about,

541
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,720
 what would have to be true of them?

542
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,280
 Don't think too hard.

543
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,100
 I did it for you.

544
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,480
 They would have to be the most unpredictable,

545
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 ever growing, always changing personality imaginable.

546
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,040
 Right?

547
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,280
 Otherwise they would get dull and boring.

548
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,700
 That is not true of God.

549
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,640
 You see, God is not unpredictable.

550
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,220
 He's steadfast.

551
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,760
 God is not always changing.

552
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
 He is unchangeable.

553
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
 God's not always growing.

554
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,700
 He's already perfect.

555
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,880
 God is infinitely deep, inexhaustibly wonderful,

556
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,600
 and he is completely perfect.

557
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,840
 The scriptures say, because that is all true,

558
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,480
 you can seek to know him.

559
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,680
 Like they describe it, the authors in the scriptures,

560
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,240
 that God is unsearchable.

561
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,660
 What does that word mean?

562
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,160
 Like, I guess I'll never hear the end of that.

563
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
 I'll never learn as much about God as possible.

564
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,680
 No, it means God is one

565
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,360
 that you can never reach the end of.

566
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,340
 So go get it.

567
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,400
 Like, don't look elsewhere.

568
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
 Just keep going.

569
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,520
 Like it only ever gets better.

570
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
 This is what the scriptures say in Psalm 145, three,

571
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
 "Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

572
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,880
 And his greatness is unsearchable."

573
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,360
 Isaiah 40, 28, "Have you not known?

574
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,640
 Have you not heard?

575
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,980
 Listen up.

576
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,760
 The Lord is the everlasting God,

577
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,080
 the creator of the ends of the earth.

578
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,760
 He does not faint or grow weary.

579
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,440
 His understanding is unsearchable."

580
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,000
 Romans 11, 33, "Oh, the depths of the riches

581
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,560
 and the wisdom and the knowledge of God."

582
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,400
 How?

583
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,880
 How?

584
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,160
 Are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways.

585
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,600
 Friends, God is,

586
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,920
 he is both wildly beautiful

587
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,240
 and wonderfully knowable.

588
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,640
 And he's available to us.

589
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,120
 Does that not do something to you?

590
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,000
 Does that not stir your heart,

591
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,400
 stun your gaze,

592
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,880
 and arrest your whole being?

593
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,400
 So say we buy into this.

594
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,320
 Like you're here and all of that resonates with you.

595
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,160
 Each of those reasons you're in,

596
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,680
 you're like, "Man, I wanna give it a shot."

597
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,200
 What are the results then?

598
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,360
 What happens when you do?

599
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,640
 Well, David tells us.

600
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,980
 He says this, jumping back to verse one,

601
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,640
 "The Lord is my light and my salvation.

602
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,840
 Whom shall I fear?

603
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,140
 The Lord is the stronghold of my life.

604
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,580
 Of whom shall I be afraid?

605
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,460
 When evil doers assail me to eat up my flesh,

606
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,960
 my adversaries and foes,

607
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
 it is they who stumble and fall.

608
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,520
 Though an army encamp against me,

609
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,480
 my heart shall not fear.

610
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,000
 The war rise against me, yet I will be confident."

611
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,700
 You see, the first result of being near to God

612
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,520
 is fearlessness.

613
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,860
 That's the first result.

614
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,360
 It's fearlessness.

615
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,280
 Nearness to God makes you fearless in life.

616
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,840
 I'll say it again for the people in the back.

617
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,920
 Nearness to God makes you fearless in life.

618
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,320
 And we know this by our own experience,

619
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,360
 that when you're with someone you trust,

620
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,980
 your confidence, it increases, right?

621
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,340
 So if I went around this room and I said,

622
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,560
 "Hey, don't volunteer yourself,

623
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,520
 but volunteer a friend of yours

624
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,280
 that you know has a really good singing voice."

625
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
 We would all point to someone, right?

626
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
 Like we all know someone here that we would say,

627
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,400
 "Hey, yeah, like you right there,

628
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,420
 that your friend is totally outing in this moment.

629
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,680
 How would you feel if I brought you up onto this stage?"

630
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,380
 And I said, "In this moment, just sing for everybody."

631
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,280
 Not so good.

632
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,760
 Yeah.

633
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,760
 But what if I told you that Hayden and Davy,

634
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,000
 we're gonna come right out here

635
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 and they were gonna sing alongside you?

636
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,020
 Your nearness to them

637
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,680
 would make you fearless for this moment.

638
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,660
 You see, that's what happens when we walk with God

639
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,220
 in close proximity.

640
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,220
 We feel our fearlessness rise, our confidence surge.

641
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,440
 This is what happens to David.

642
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,760
 Like look at the way he describes it.

643
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,440
 He says, "The Lord is my light and my salvation

644
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,360
 and my stronghold."

645
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,880
 Why does he call God by all of these titles?

646
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,240
 Like David, are you just religiously riffing here?

647
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,960
 What are you talking about?

648
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,960
 No, he says, "When I face darkness, God was my light.

649
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,740
 When I face danger, God was my salvation.

650
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,260
 When I face disaster, God was my stronghold."

651
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,880
 Like David knew God provided for me in the past

652
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,540
 so I can trust him with my future.

653
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,800
 And what's amazing is he not only repeats

654
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,020
 that he shall not fear,

655
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,160
 but he does so in the face of escalating circumstances.

656
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
 Did you catch it?

657
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
 Like if you read through this,

658
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,520
 in these verses, he goes from general evildoers

659
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,680
 to personal adversaries, to an army encamped against him,

660
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,880
 to a war rising about him.

661
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,500
 Watch out, things are getting worse.

662
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,720
 But David doesn't escalate.

663
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,080
 He only grows more at ease

664
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,640
 because nearness to God makes you fearless in life.

665
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,980
 Charles Spurgeon, Prince of Preachers, once said,

666
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,120
 "I've learned to kiss the wave

667
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,340
 that throws me against the rock of ages."

668
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,680
 Friends, listen to me.

669
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,600
 God has not called you nor me to have a fair weather faith,

670
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,060
 and live through always easy circumstances.

671
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,260
 No, life's not like that.

672
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,440
 Life's hard.

673
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,640
 It's difficult.

674
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,880
 We know it through our own experience

675
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,240
 or through someone else's.

676
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,080
 And we also know it by God's word.

677
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,080
 Jesus himself said, "In this world, you will have trouble,

678
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,940
 but take heart, I've overcome the world."

679
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,800
 You will, as you walk with God, have a battle-tested faith,

680
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,540
 but what you'll find is the same thing David found.

681
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,840
 You'll find no matter what trouble comes,

682
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,160
 I'm safe 'cause I'm right beside you, Lord.

683
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,040
 I'm immovable.

684
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,760
 I'm anchored.

685
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,520
 I will not be shaken.

686
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,060
 This was David's approach, and it can be yours too.

687
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,320
 We see David continues in verses five through six,

688
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,700
 and he brings us to our second result.

689
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,340
 He says, "For he will hide me in his shelter

690
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,180
 in the day of trouble.

691
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,880
 He will conceal me under the cover of his tent.

692
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,420
 He will lift me high upon a rock,

693
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,080
 and now my head shall be lifted up

694
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,300
 above my enemies all around me,

695
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,460
 and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy.

696
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,680
 I will sing and make melody to the Lord.

697
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,820
 And now my head shall be lifted up."

698
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,420
 So let me ask you, what causes your head to hang low?

699
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,680
 What causes your head to hang low?

700
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,900
 Yeah, thank you.

701
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,060
 The Bible would say something very similar

702
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,340
 to those two things of shame and doubt.

703
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,820
 It would point, as you study the entire body of Scripture,

704
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,740
 that the two things that cause our eyes to drop

705
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,100
 and our heads to hang are fear of circumstances,

706
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,660
 doubt that God is good,

707
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,020
 problems at work, ruined relationship,

708
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,700
 betrayal from friends, reputation on the rocks,

709
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,300
 like fear of circumstances will cause your head to hang,

710
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,940
 and so will shame from sin,

711
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,340
 that you really are that bad,

712
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,780
 and you never will get any better, will you?

713
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,820
 This is what causes our heads to hang.

714
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,540
 And you know what happens when your head hangs low?

715
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,960
 You lose sight.

716
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,700
 You lose focus of the one thing

717
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,100
 you should keep your gaze fixed upon.

718
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,360
 You stop focusing on what matters,

719
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,020
 and you start focusing on what doesn't.

720
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,460
 You will hear me say this often,

721
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,220
 but for tonight, this is the first you've heard it.

722
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,860
 All of life is either a drawing near

723
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,560
 or a drifting away from God.

724
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,820
 All of life.

725
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,680
 Like there's no neutral option.

726
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,780
 There's never a neutral decision.

727
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,540
 Everything you do, the way you walked in,

728
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,980
 the music you listened to, the way you walk out,

729
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,460
 the way you talk to your neighbor,

730
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,860
 the things that you're thinking,

731
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,420
 all of it will either draw you in

732
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,140
 or drift you away from God.

733
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,300
 And the reason that's the case

734
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,460
 is because we have an enemy that hates us.

735
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,400
 He hates you.

736
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,300
 He doesn't want you to be close to God.

737
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,780
 He'll do everything in his power

738
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,720
 to distract your attention and divert your affections

739
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 and ultimately distance you from the one that loves you.

740
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,920
 And so friends, we've gotta be vigilant.

741
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,220
 We have to hold fast and stay steady to the fact

742
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,460
 that God is the one whom we should hold onto.

743
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,320
 Not simply because with him we're fearless,

744
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,320
 but in so doing, the second result, we become joyful.

745
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,620
 We become joyful.

746
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,940
 You see, David is sitting here saying,

747
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,940
 "I don't need to cower in fear.

748
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,980
 "I don't care how many foes or enemies

749
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,580
 "or rivals I have that are out against me.

750
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,540
 "God has lifted me high upon a rock.

751
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,940
 "Like I don't need to hide in shame

752
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,020
 "because God has lifted my head.

753
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,980
 "I can rejoice.

754
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,940
 "I can offer in his tents with shouts of joy."

755
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,140
 This is what David is pointing to.

756
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,220
 He is saying the intensity of your joy

757
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,740
 depends on your proximity to God.

758
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:52,340
 The intensity of your joy, how hot you burn with gladness,

759
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,720
 it depends on your proximity to God.

760
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,420
 Psalm 1611, we read this a few weeks ago.

761
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,420
 Put this verse to memory.

762
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,940
 Says, "You, God, make known to me the path of life.

763
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,400
 "In your presence, as close to you as possible

764
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,840
 "is not just joy, but the fullness thereof.

765
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,900
 "At your right hand, God, are pleasures forevermore."

766
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,540
 If this is not sufficient reason to draw near to God,

767
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,780
 I don't know what is.

768
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,900
 And yet for many of us,

769
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,580
 while we might agree with this in theory,

770
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,460
 our lives would play advocate against us.

771
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,620
 They would instead suggest we are trusting

772
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,060
 in something else to give us the satisfaction we seek.

773
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,260
 But here's what you need to know.

774
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,800
 When it comes to joy,

775
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,340
 you have two options in your pursuit.

776
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,000
 You can seek after it or you can search for it.

777
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,380
 What's the difference?

778
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,540
 Seeking implies you know where to find it.

779
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,700
 Searching implies you don't know where to begin.

780
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,800
 Some of us have been searching for joy.

781
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,220
 We've looked in all manner of places.

782
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,660
 Like if we're honest with ourselves,

783
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,180
 we know that we've looked away from God

784
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,020
 in two other things in the hopes

785
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,440
 that that thing will give me the satisfaction I seek.

786
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,820
 So what's it for you?

787
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,280
 Like, is it approval from a guy?

788
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,300
 Even if it means reducing yourself

789
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,160
 in ways that belittle your self-worth?

790
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,560
 Is it acceptance from your coworkers?

791
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,600
 Even if it means you have to compromise

792
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,400
 in order to be let in?

793
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,960
 Is it piling on the good works?

794
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,380
 Because you're so desperate to be identified

795
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,680
 as a good person, yet it burns you out

796
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,060
 and leaves you wasted.

797
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:01,440
 Is it some sort of coping mechanism?

798
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,200
 Some kind of addiction you find yourself

799
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,840
 running back to time and time again?

800
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,180
 Food, drugs, substances, alcohol, pornography, you name it.

801
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,160
 Is it something that has a foothold in your life?

802
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,020
 What is it?

803
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,240
 What is it that you're running to

804
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,640
 in the hopes that joy might be underneath there?

805
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,600
 Listen, I've looked.

806
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,900
 It is found nowhere else but Him.

807
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,360
 There is joy nowhere else from Him.

808
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,160
 Sure, you may find something that scratches the itch.

809
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,280
 You may find something that ultimately curbs

810
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,400
 some little sense of satisfaction.

811
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,940
 You may find something that helps you

812
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,120
 to sleep better in the evening,

813
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,040
 but you will wake up the next morning

814
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,720
 and you will feel just as empty as the night before.

815
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,360
 This is what the world's offering you.

816
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,940
 This is what the enemy is deceiving you with.

817
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:06,840
 This word, His word, has come to tell you tonight the truth.

818
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,780
 You can search the whole world and no joy you'll find,

819
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,960
 or you can seek it in me and I'll give it in abundance.

820
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,120
 Will you seek after it with Him?

821
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,860
 Everything else in comparison,

822
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,000
 knowing that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift,

823
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,040
 it's rubbish in contest.

824
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,160
 He is better.

825
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,560
 He's better.

826
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
 He's better.

827
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,080
 He's better than whatever it is you find

828
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,320
 some sick sense of satisfaction or gratification in.

829
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,600
 I remember when I was in college

830
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,680
 struggling with a porn addiction,

831
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,140
 telling God, "I like this more than I like you."

832
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,240
 That was the most freeing honesty

833
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,680
 I could have given Him in that moment.

834
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
 To look at Him and say, "God, I do want this more,

835
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,100
 "but I know I shouldn't.

836
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,040
 "I want to want you."

837
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,280
 Will you stir that up in me, God, please?

838
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,400
 You see, God is better.

839
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,480
 He's deserving of desire.

840
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,040
 He's worthy of wanting.

841
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,800
 And tonight He is prompting your pursuit

842
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,280
 because in Him you're gonna find everything

843
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,380
 and more that you could ever want.

844
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,160
 So where do you start?

845
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,400
 You start where I did.

846
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,680
 In the corner booth of a Taco Bell

847
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,740
 at 11.30 p.m. as an 18-year-old.

848
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,820
 It was there that I sat across the table from a friend

849
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,320
 that spoke of the God we've been talking about,

850
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,300
 not the God that I knew,

851
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:58,400
 but a God that transcended my wildest imagination

852
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,400
 and confronted my personal presumptions of Him.

853
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,400
 It was there that everything changed

854
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,920
 because it was there as I saw someone

855
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,560
 genuinely walking with God that I wanted it for myself.

856
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,960
 I do not stand here tonight as someone saying,

857
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
 "Hey, follow me."

858
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,320
 That will never be the message I preach from this platform,

859
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,360
 but I will always stand from this stage

860
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,380
 and look at you and say, "Follow Him,"

861
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,380
 because in Him is everything you could ever desire.

862
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,780
 Are you walking with Him?

863
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,540
 Do you know Him?

864
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,840
 Tonight, He's bidding you come close.

865
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,940
 You see, this can be frustrating to you,

866
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,960
 or it can be fascinating to you.

867
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,340
 You could come tonight and say,

868
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,140
 "Just give me some directions, man.

869
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,820
 "What am I supposed to do?"

870
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:04,340
 Or you could just receive the desire

871
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,380
 that the Holy Spirit wants to prompt within.

872
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,960
 (gentle music)

873
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,980
 I don't want to move forward quickly to the next step.

874
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,660
 How do I do all of this?

875
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,300
 That's what this series is for.

876
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,340
 Tonight, I just want us to feel the fascination

877
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:31,620
 of a God that is more beautiful than we've known

878
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,780
 and more knowable than we dared to dream.

879
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,960
 (gentle music)

880
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,240
 And I want us to seek Him.

881
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:50,460
 And what you should know is we only can seek God

882
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,400
 because He first sought after us.

883
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,620
 You see, there is a God worthy of wanting,

884
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,620
 but what's crazy is He pursued a people unworthy of wanting.

885
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,100
 A people unworthy of wanting.

886
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,860
 That all the story of the scriptures is saying,

887
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,700
 "Man, God, He wanted to dwell amongst us.

888
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,820
 "He wanted to be present with you."

889
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,240
 And now the invitation through Jesus is on the table

890
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,520
 saying, "Hey, come and be present with me.

891
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,540
 "Come and experience my goodness."

892
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:30,340
 And yet what we know from the Bible

893
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
 is that no one sought after God.

894
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,660
 None, not one.

895
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:43,540
 And yet God, looking upon a people unworthy,

896
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,780
 unbefitting of His love, chose to love us instead.

897
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,660
 And so this presence that we've talked about all evening,

898
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,660
 the presence of God, became manifest in the person of Jesus.

899
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,760
 The God from up there became the God down here,

900
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,540
 walking amongst us in a way

901
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,400
 that would not have turned your eye,

902
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,960
 with no beauty or form or majesty

903
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,600
 that you would regard Him at all,

904
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,260
 and yet was so beautiful intrinsically

905
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:22,460
 that God had changed the world

906
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,640
 and motivated people to follow Him and learn from Him,

907
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,240
 seek to know Him,

908
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,520
 and in so doing become like Him.

909
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,720
 And this God, a God that came to be with you and I,

910
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,060
 didn't just come in the form of Jesus

911
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,080
 for the 33 years He lived here,

912
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,000
 but He came to give His life,

913
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,200
 that we might be with Him for all eternity,

914
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,300
 where He is today.

915
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,760
 Jesus, the Son of God, laid down His perfect life,

916
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,320
 beautiful life,

917
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,720
 for the sake of a world that was not worthy.

918
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,760
 He was hung upon a Roman execution rack,

919
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,800
 and in so doing, He absorbed the consequence of all our sin.

920
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,920
 And after being laid to rest, dead in the ground,

921
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,800
 He rose forth from the grave,

922
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,120
 saying, "I not only came to be with you,

923
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,560
 "I came to get you, to bring you where I now am."

924
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,240
 Do you know Him?

925
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,640
 He has come to seek after you.

926
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,640
 The question is, will you seek after Him in return?

927
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,960
 Let me pray for us.

928
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,840
 God,

929
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,160
 there is none like You, God.

930
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,760
 We say again, there is none like You,

931
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,200
 not in heaven, nor on earth, nor beneath the earth, God.

932
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,680
 You and You alone stand supreme.

933
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,240
 You and You alone stand distinct.

934
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,920
 You and You alone, God, are ultimately significant,

935
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,480
 transcendent, omnipotent, and worthy of our pursuit.

936
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,660
 Yet, God, none of us could arise to the standard, Lord,

937
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,720
 that we needed to be connected to You.

938
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,600
 And so, God, what You did is lowered Yourself

939
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,080
 to fulfill that standard, to live the life we could not,

940
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,400
 die the death we deserve.

941
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,960
 (gentle music)

942
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,080
 That all the sin, God, we were so weighted beneath

943
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,140
 might be paid for.

944
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:34,040
 And in rising forth, God, You extended an invitation.

945
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,280
 Come get me, come follow me, choose me,

946
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,400
 come close to me and see within me

947
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
 that beauty which you'll find nowhere else.

948
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,040
 Find within me that knowledge which you'll know nowhere else.

949
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,360
 (gentle music)

950
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,440
 And receive a kind of joy this world will never offer.

951
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,520
 Lord, we rejoice in the fact

952
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:07,500
 that while we were sinners, Christ died for us.

953
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,160
 We love You.

954
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,120
 Thank You, God, for the gift of Your pursuit.

955
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,840
 We respond in that pursuit now.

956
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,800
 It's in Jesus' name, amen.
