1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
 >> Hey, PORCH.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,860
 Join me as we read God's word together.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,820
 From the gospel of Matthew chapter 28 verses 16 through 20.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:21,100
 Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them,

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,660
 and they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:34,100
 And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,860
 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,300
 the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all I have commanded you.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,700
 And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,940
 Now our final message and our series called "Disciple."

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,460
 >> PORCH, how we doing?

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
 We doing okay?

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,540
 Hey, it's great to be together.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
 Thanks for joining us here.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,140
 I know it is Tuesday of Thanksgiving week, and yet I don't think you could be in a better

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,740
 place tonight.

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,380
 I think God has something really tremendous in store for us.

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,020
 I think that every week.

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,980
 And yet tonight, I think that he is going to serve something up that many of us need

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,980
 this evening.

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,940
 Now, before we get going, I do want to say hey to a couple of special locations that

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,660
 are tuning in with us from around the nation.

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,260
 Special shout out to Portsligh Fort Worth, special shout out to Portsligh Wheaton, and

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,940
 then Portsligh Greater Lafayette.

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,940
 We love you guys.

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,820
 We're grateful that God is working where you are and we get to be a small part of it.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:47,140
 While it's not uncommon in ministry circles to show up to a gender specific worship event.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,580
 Some of you have been to one of these before where you show up and it's an all guys or

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,540
 an all girls worship night.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,780
 Now I've worked for a ministry where this was an annual, it was an annual regularity

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
 for us.

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,100
 We would always put on one every single year.

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
 And it was special.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,180
 Like I didn't know what happened to girls nights, but I knew every time the guys got

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,500
 together, it was a really meaningful time.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,740
 Like we would find frequent references to Braveheart and there would often be stories

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,700
 about hunting and lessons about women.

38
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,980
 Which doesn't feel any different than your regular time with the boys.

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,940
 And yet this was characterized by the sound of every man singing in their deepest possible

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,380
 voice.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,380
 It was awesome.

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,060
 Now, to really put an exclamation point on these evenings, what we would do is we would

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,580
 always bring in a big, a big name guest speaker.

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,260
 Like we just wanted to really blow the top off and make it a really special time.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,380
 And so we would do it with the girls, we would do it with the guys.

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,340
 And because I was on staff, part of my responsibility was just to host the guy, make sure that he

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,700
 didn't need for anything.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,660
 And so we have a special guest speaker and I'm kind of his glorified shadow, a bodyguard

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
 of sorts.

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,020
 I know no fighting technique and yet here I am just trying to look as intimidating as

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,180
 possible and yet everything looks totally normal.

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,540
 There's no difficulty over the course of our entire evening.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,460
 That is until I noticed what appeared to be some suspicious behavior.

54
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,580
 Now part of my job is to be on the lookout for things that are out of the ordinary or

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
 odd.

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,660
 And so when the evening began, things were fine.

57
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,580
 Worship started, the guys were gathering, they were booming with their voice.

58
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,940
 That is until I looked across the room and I saw what appeared to be something uniquely

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
 different.

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,760
 Suspicious, to say the least.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,460
 Because across the room, there were two guys sitting there that looked different than the

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,940
 rest of the crowd.

63
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,740
 You see, you may be wondering what looked different about them.

64
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,420
 Well it was what they were wearing in specific.

65
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,080
 Now I never judge people for what they wear and yet these guys were dressed in black from

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,140
 head to toe, which is ironic now that I'm thinking about it.

67
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,180
 But it wasn't just that they were wearing black from head to toe, they had sun shades

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,720
 on, caps pulled low, hoods thrown up over their heads and their hands in their pocket

69
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,820
 and not trying to bring about any sort of attention to themselves.

70
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,180
 It's odd to say the least, especially when sun shades and sweatshirts don't make sense

71
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,740
 in a dark room where a bunch of burly men are gathered about singing and sweating all

72
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
 together.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
 It just doesn't make sense.

74
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,200
 And so what I do is I grab a security guard and I make my way over to where these two

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 guys are.

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,080
 And so we approach them very discreetly and as we get near to them we realize, man, okay,

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,720
 they can't see us but we can't see them.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,320
 And so I can't make out what's actually happening in this moment.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,880
 And so we grab them and we pull them out into the hallway, escort them very gently into

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,500
 a lit space so that way we can pull their hoods, lift their glasses and identify what

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,080
 exactly is going on here.

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,320
 And I'm not kidding you when I say the most surprising thing happened in this moment.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,600
 They were girls at the guy's worship night.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,320
 So when I asked them, took them to task and begged them to tell me, "What are you doing

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,420
 here?"

86
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,200
 They told me that they just love this guest speaker so much.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,880
 Now why do I tell you that?

88
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,520
 Because the minute we learned who these girls really were, we learned what they really cared

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,360
 about so much so that they put on a disguise, hide in plain sight and even endeavor to get

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,200
 as close to this guy as humanly possible.

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,760
 You see, tonight we're going to see who Jesus really is, that he is the resurrected king.

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,880
 And we're going to see as a result what he really cares about, saving the world and bringing

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,440
 as many people into his kingdom as possible, so much so that he would put on a disguise.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,560
 He would hide in plain sight because he wants to get as close to you and me as he can.

95
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,480
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 28.

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,840
 It's what Franklin read a minute ago.

97
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,020
 We're just going to work our way through it.

98
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,940
 You know this passage famously as the great commission, which as I say that many of you

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,560
 just immediately begin to check out.

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
 You've heard the lessons, you've read the stories, you've memorized the verses, you

101
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,520
 know this thing better than I do.

102
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,400
 You might as well come up here and preach it yourself.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
 And yet here's what I would endeavor in this moment to say, I don't know that we know the

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,480
 great commission as well as we think.

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,260
 And so tonight what I want to do is I just want to walk us through this passage of scripture

106
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,440
 and I want to save us from falling prey to being too Christian for our own good.

107
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
 Meaning we know all about Jesus, but we don't really know Jesus himself.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,540
 You see, we've been in a series called Disciple where we've been talking about that idea,

109
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,160
 the idea of walking with Christ in the wonder of who he is, because I have this deep seated

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,160
 fear like as I've visited with people over the course of my year now, what I've seen

111
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,600
 in our people that I'm desperately praying God would save us from is spiritual apathy.

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,000
 What I'm asking the Lord to do is to give us a sense of holy urgency because I see too

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,160
 many of us slipping into the motions of being a Christian, going to the Bible studies, raising

114
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,980
 our hands and singing the songs and praying some prayers and dropping money in the collection

115
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,780
 plate that we don't pass collection plates any longer.

116
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:27,340
 We are slipping into the motions of becoming, of being good Christians, but we're not, we're

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:35,040
 not moving with the kind of motivation to become like Christ.

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,920
 And so tonight, as we work through this chapter, here's what we're going to see.

119
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,360
 Jesus, he wants what you want.

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,880
 So many of us, we're not motivated to become like Christ because we're motivated to become

121
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
 something else.

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,120
 We want to be impactful or we want to make a difference or we want to become someone

123
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
 significant.

124
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,840
 We want to be connected to something that matters.

125
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
 We want to leave a legacy.

126
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,720
 Like we want to make a difference in the world.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,880
 And Jesus wants the same thing for you.

128
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,320
 And yet what he knows that we need to know tonight that we have worked all series long

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,240
 to help you understand is that will not be found anywhere else, but it will be found

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,000
 with him.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,420
 All of that that you long for, it is found in this man and not this world.

132
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:33,120
 You see Jesus, he wants to connect you to something that is so significant, is so important.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
 Like it's so climactic.

134
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
 It's even dramatic.

135
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,580
 Even he has a purpose for your life.

136
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,400
 And tonight we're going to talk about what that purpose is.

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,160
 And he's given us the great commission to clarify it.

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,360
 But before we can talk about what that purpose is, we've got to talk about who that purpose

139
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 is for.

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,880
 So this is what it says, Matthew 28, starting in verse 16.

141
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,440
 It says, "Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
 them.

143
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
 And when they saw him, they worshiped him.

144
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
 But some doubted."

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
 We'll stop there.

146
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
 What we need to know as we come to this passage is that Jesus has risen from the dead.

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,360
 He has appeared to not one, but two different Marys.

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,440
 And he has given these ladies instructions on where his disciples should meet him.

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,040
 He's literally dropped a pin in their ancient near Eastern GPS and said, "Hey, this is where

150
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
 I'm going to be.

151
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
 Send the boys to find me."

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,680
 And what we know about that location is it's in Galilee at the mountain.

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 Why does that matter?

154
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,800
 Often when we read these types of things, we catch a location and we just kind of steamroll

155
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
 by it.

156
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
 We just keep moving, right?

157
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,880
 Because that's not important information.

158
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 There's more going on here.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 Jesus is going to say some things.

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 I want to know what he's saying.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,320
 And yet this location is incredibly significant for a couple of reasons.

162
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,920
 Number one, he says he's going to the mountain.

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,880
 Now there's a lot of debate about what mountain Jesus is speaking about.

164
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,920
 Some scholars think that he's talking about the Mount of Commission, which is where he

165
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,680
 ascended to a high place and he called his disciples to himself and he commissioned them

166
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
 to become his disciples, to follow him.

167
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
 Others believe it's where he taught the Sermon on the Mount, where he unpacked what the upside

168
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
 down kingdom looked like.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,400
 He gave us kingdom ethics and kingdom economy so that way we knew how we could work through

170
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,000
 this world, living in the kingdom that he has inaugurated and handed over to us.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,760
 But here's what I think.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,840
 I think that what Jesus is speaking about is the Mount of Transfiguration.

173
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560
 The Mount of Transfiguration.

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,280
 If you're not familiar with what the Mount of Transfiguration is, it's a mount that Jesus

175
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,560
 ascended, located in Galilee, where he transfigured.

176
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,600
 Galilee, the Greek there is metamorpho, that he transformed in front of three disciples,

177
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,440
 Peter, James, and John, and he revealed to them exactly who he is.

178
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,840
 It's kind of like what happens at your wedding when you lift the veil on your bride and you

179
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,360
 behold all her beauty.

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,920
 Jesus lifted the veil and he revealed to his disciples, "Hey, this is who I am.

181
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 I'm amazing.

182
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,360
 I'm splendorous.

183
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
 I'm marvelous.

184
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,080
 I am not just a man.

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,680
 I am the son of man.

186
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,600
 I am not just a good teacher.

187
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,120
 I am a God-like figure because I am the son of God himself."

188
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,640
 That's what Jesus did at the Mount of Transfiguration.

189
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,320
 And the reason I think, as well as many other scholars, it's not just me, there's veracity

190
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,160
 to this point, is because Jesus in this chapter, chapter 28, he says, as well as the angel

191
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,080
 who appeared to Mary and the other Mary, that they shall come to Galilee where they shall

192
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,320
 see me.

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040
 See me.

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,080
 There's one mountain in Galilee where they truly saw Jesus.

195
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,280
 Now why does that even matter?

196
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,600
 Because Jesus wants to verify for his disciples here in this climactic moment where he's risen

197
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,880
 from the dead and he's going to commission them out that he is who he says he is.

198
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
 He wants there to be no mistake.

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,520
 Hey, this is who I say I am.

200
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,120
 And to prove it, I'm leading you back to the place where I gave you a teaser one time before,

201
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,240
 and yet now I'm going to cement the idea as reality in your world.

202
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,760
 But then he also says that he needs them to come to Galilee.

203
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,920
 Why does Galilee matter?

204
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,920
 Well, Galilee matters for a couple of different reasons, primarily because it was the place

205
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,840
 where the disciples walked with Jesus over the course of his earthly ministry.

206
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,240
 Like this is the place where they were called to follow him and they saw him do everything

207
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
 that he did.

208
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,560
 They heard the lessons and they saw the stories unfold.

209
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
 It's why as we've over the course of this series been staring through their perspective

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,360
 at Jesus, seeking to learn what it means to walk with him because they saw him themselves

211
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,000
 and walked with him personally.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,400
 So he leads them to Galilee.

213
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,520
 And what's significant, catch this, this is so cool.

214
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,280
 They are in Jerusalem when they get the command, the instruction to rendezvous with him in

215
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,460
 Galilee.

216
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,800
 That means they've got a journey ahead.

217
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,240
 They've got to get up and they've got to move.

218
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,840
 Yet what's so significant about it is they are South and they've got to go North.

219
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,360
 And as they go North, they are literally going to retrace every step, see every site, smell

220
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 the same smells, speak to the same people more than likely that they encountered over

221
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
 the course of their ministry with him.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,360
 He wants to take them down memory lane.

223
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,160
 He wants to do with them what I did with my wife on our one year dating anniversary.

224
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,440
 He wants to relive all of the beauty and the glory and the wonder of what happened in our

225
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,860
 first year together.

226
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,000
 That's what I did with Brooke.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,680
 That's what many of you have done yourself.

228
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,240
 That's what many of you probably should do yourself.

229
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,960
 It's a really good date idea so you can take a note and slip it away in your journal.

230
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
 Why did I do that with Brooke?

231
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,040
 Choose to relive year one with her.

232
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,800
 Not just to contemplate the past, but to accelerate our future.

233
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,560
 Like I knew as we look back, we're going to catch a vision for what's ahead.

234
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,880
 As we think about how good this has been, we're going to be motivated for how great

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,960
 it's going to be.

236
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,920
 And Jesus wants to do the same thing.

237
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,840
 Where I had big plans for Brooke and I, Jesus has big plans for he and the disciples.

238
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,840
 He has a purpose for their life.

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,920
 He is inviting them into something so special.

240
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,200
 And so he takes them back where it all began because he wants them to know, hey, as good

241
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,760
 as it was, it's only going to get better.

242
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,160
 The other reason he takes them to Galilee, which I think is really important, is it adds

243
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,240
 veracity to the fact that the great commission did not happen right before Christ's ascension.

244
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,200
 That moment where he looks to heaven and says, "Beam me up, Scotty."

245
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,840
 They didn't happen concurrently.

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,640
 Some of us, we don't know that.

247
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,280
 It's a common misconception that Jesus gave these words, he said this command, and then

248
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
 he went straight to heaven.

249
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,920
 And yet Acts 1-3 tells us that he presented himself alive to them after his suffering

250
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,520
 by many proofs, appearing to them during 40 days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

251
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,680
 Like Jesus puts on this 40-day masterclass because he wants to prove to them, "Hey, I

252
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,760
 am who I said I am, and I'm going to prepare you for what I've called you to do."

253
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,400
 There were 40 days between his resurrection and his ascension, which I think is amazing,

254
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:29,720
 given the fact that upon his appearance, some worshipped him, but some doubted him.

255
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,640
 How does that make you feel, knowing that?

256
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,840
 That some of these disciples, they doubted him.

257
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,200
 The resurrected king, I love it.

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,120
 I think it's amazing, which may not be necessarily what you were feeling.

259
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,080
 And yet the reason I love it is because, number one, it adds proof, veracity.

260
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,080
 It gives substance to the fact that this isn't fiction.

261
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,840
 Like if the disciples were just going to make up Christianity, you don't put a giant gaping

262
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,080
 hole in the story that other people can pour water through and ultimately puncture unto

263
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
 disbelief.

264
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 You don't do that.

265
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
 That would be a terrible idea.

266
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,640
 No, you want to present an airtight defense that Jesus is the son of God.

267
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,400
 He rose from the dead and everybody believed, and yet that's not what happens.

268
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,440
 The story doesn't read that way because the story's true.

269
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
 They recounted history in this moment.

270
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,280
 But I also love it because it leads us to our first point.

271
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:32,640
 It tells us who Jesus' purpose is for, that Jesus gives purpose to saints and skeptics

272
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,360
 and screw-ups.

273
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,740
 He gives purpose to saints and skeptics and screw-ups.

274
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,600
 Which one there are you?

275
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,740
 You see, the saints are the ones that worshipped him.

276
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,120
 And yet we know that some doubt it, that there are skeptics in their midst.

277
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,320
 Like these are the 11 disciples, the very men that Jesus handpicked himself, that watched

278
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,040
 him firsthand in his ministry, that beheld all of the incredible things we just wish

279
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
 we could see ourselves.

280
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,880
 Like as they walked with him, they saw him calm the storm and walk on the water and multiply

281
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,340
 the loaves and turn water into wine and heal the sick and raise the dead and exercise demons.

282
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:20,680
 They saw amazing things, and yet even still, some doubted.

283
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,240
 It's kind of like when I went rappelling for the very first time in my life.

284
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
 Anybody been rappelling in here?

285
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
 Show of hands just around the room.

286
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,800
 Yeah, I mean, you can attest to this.

287
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,100
 I don't care how brave or bold you are.

288
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,760
 The first time you go rappelling, which is walking down the side of a cliff face, traversing

289
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,720
 an overhang, what you feel is some sense of anxiety.

290
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
 Like you can't help it.

291
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,240
 Like you start to pit a little bit, your hands get clammy, because the thought of walking

292
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,680
 backwards off of a cliff is stupid.

293
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
 Let's just make no mistake about it.

294
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,240
 Like that's a crazy thing to do.

295
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,200
 And yet here in this moment, I understood, like we went through this really extensive

296
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,640
 safety briefing that took far longer than I actually thought necessary.

297
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,920
 They explained to me the fact that the rope I would be rappelling from could hold something

298
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,720
 upwards of 8,000 pounds, which I am nowhere close in proximity to.

299
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,520
 I watched peer after peer after peer after peer do the very thing which I was going to

300
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
 do myself.

301
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,480
 I had them check and double check and triple check.

302
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
 I didn't have them quadruple check.

303
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,080
 All of my gear to make sure that I was safe and ready to go.

304
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,480
 And yet even still, despite the fact that there was so much evidence that I was going

305
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,520
 to be okay, I still felt some anxiousness, some stress.

306
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,160
 Like I couldn't help the inner voice, my very own conscience telling me, "Hey man, they're

307
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,120
 out to get you.

308
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
 This is all one big charade.

309
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
 Don't believe what they're saying.

310
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
 Don't look at what's happening.

311
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,860
 You're going to be the exception."

312
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,000
 And yet how did I get down that cliff face?

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,200
 Well, not wanting to be a coward, I rappelled down it.

314
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:06,480
 And the way that I did so, despite my doubt, is I wrestled through my doubt.

315
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:15,680
 I wrestled through it by trusting the fact my guide is who he says he is.

316
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 And so I could take one backward step of faith at a time until I too slipped over the lip

317
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,840
 of that cliff face and found myself walking in an experience the likes of which I had

318
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,080
 not known in this world.

319
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,760
 I experienced wonder.

320
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
 Jesus knows you'll doubt.

321
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
 He's not disappointed by it.

322
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,540
 He's not concerned when you question.

323
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,360
 He's not annoyed by your anxieties.

324
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,920
 He isn't ignorant to the fact that this life is hard, that trouble abounds, that difficulty

325
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
 will come.

326
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,040
 He even says so himself that in this world you're going to have trouble, but take heart.

327
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,120
 I've overcome the world.

328
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,320
 He knows.

329
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,520
 Some of you in this room right here tonight in the realest way possible, you've taken

330
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,060
 some hits because of your allegiance to him.

331
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,640
 Allegiance to him has cost you family.

332
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
 It's cost you friends.

333
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 It's cost you relationships.

334
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,760
 Convictions to Christ have led you to break off relationships and set aside friendships.

335
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,920
 You have felt persecution because you choose to follow him.

336
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,040
 He's not naive nor unknown to that reality.

337
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,760
 He knows it's going to be hard.

338
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,000
 You'll have good reason for doubt.

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,980
 He's not surprised, and yet he wants to do with you what he did with them.

340
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,360
 He wants to take you to the mount, back to that place, that moment where you were clear

341
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,880
 in knowing he is who he says he is, and he wants to walk you to Galilee, back to the

342
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,200
 place where you remember every step you've taken with him before, and you can be assured

343
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,640
 of the fact that he is as faithful today as he was back then.

344
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,240
 You see, Jesus, he doesn't give up on you.

345
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,880
 So don't give up on him either.

346
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 Lean in.

347
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,060
 Push forward.

348
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,780
 It's never too late with Christ.

349
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,200
 We see he has purpose for saints, those that worship.

350
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,360
 He has purpose for skeptics, those that doubt.

351
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,280
 And we see that he has purpose for screw-ups, which you may not have seen it in the passage

352
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,080
 because it's subtly tucked away in there, and yet what we know is that there are 11

353
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,160
 disciples in this moment.

354
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,640
 Some of you are like, "Well, there were 12.

355
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,040
 One of them, he hit the hay.

356
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,720
 Judas is gone."

357
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,220
 And yet what we know is that 11 still exist.

358
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,440
 That should catch us off guard.

359
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,800
 That should feel surprising.

360
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,240
 Why?

361
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,400
 Because that means Peter's numbered amongst their group.

362
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,240
 He's the last person that should be in this room because he's the first person that abandoned,

363
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
 abandoned Jesus.

364
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:19,920
 And yet Peter, this major screw-up, he's here in this moment receiving Christ's purpose

365
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:27,840
 and moving towards a life of meaning and significance and importance and magnitude that he's longed

366
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,680
 for and you likewise long for.

367
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,760
 Some of you are here and you don't need me to list all of the different ways we screw

368
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:45,520
 up because you can look in yourself and find that area which you cringe most painfully

369
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,440
 and know it's likely true of you.

370
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,800
 What I would say to you is what Dane Ortlund has said, "Where you cringe most painfully,

371
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,200
 it is there that Christ hugs most invincibly."

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,320
 He has a purpose for you, but the way you return to that purpose is you follow the example

373
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,400
 of Peter.

374
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,720
 You repent of your sins.

375
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,080
 Not some of it, not most of it, all of it.

376
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,400
 The whole 100%, you confess it to God.

377
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,480
 You receive his forgiveness because I promise you, you will not outrace the grace of God

378
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,640
 for your life.

379
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,620
 No one is too far.

380
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,920
 No one can outrun his reach.

381
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
 He has forgiveness for you.

382
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,360
 And then what you believe is he has a purpose as well.

383
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,640
 You see, Jesus is in the business of taking really broken stories and making them into

384
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,920
 really beautiful subjects that magnify the glory of God and speak to the love he has

385
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,120
 for you and for me.

386
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
 He did it for Peter.

387
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,260
 If you're a screw up here, he wants to do it for you.

388
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,760
 He has a purpose for all of us.

389
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,140
 So what is that purpose?

390
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,080
 We know who that purpose is for, but what is the purpose exactly?

391
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,040
 Well, we read it in verse 18.

392
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,480
 And Jesus came and he said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been

393
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,340
 given to me.

394
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,640
 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and

395
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,760
 of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.

396
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
 And guess what?

397
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,840
 I will be with you always to the end of the age."

398
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,040
 Now I don't know about you, but if you're anything like me, then these verses, they

399
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,560
 can read like marching orders.

400
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
 Do you ever get that when you read the Bible?

401
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,960
 Like you're kind of working your way along and it's like, "And another to do, and another

402
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,120
 to do, and another to do.

403
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
 Okay, I'm like writing them out because these are the things that I'm supposed to keep.

404
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,800
 These are the commands I'm supposed to follow.

405
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,160
 This is the string of imperatives I'm supposed to guide and order my life according to."

406
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,640
 That's what this feels like for me.

407
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,920
 Like a list of marching orders that I, the good soldier of Christ, am supposed to do

408
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,640
 as I move my way into foreign territory to the glory of God and to save the world.

409
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,080
 And yet what you need to know is that this is not a series of commands, but in fact,

410
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,480
 it's a single command.

411
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
 That's what the Greek would say.

412
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 So then what is the command?

413
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,400
 Well, the command that Jesus gives us to follow, the very single and sole command he wants

414
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,440
 us to know is that we're called to make disciples.

415
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
 This is it.

416
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,560
 The final command that Jesus ever gave, some of his famous last words.

417
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,200
 So then what does he mean when he says make disciples?

418
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,260
 He means this, put very simply, the goal isn't to make believers.

419
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,000
 It's to make becomers.

420
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,920
 Now I say that, and I know some of your antenna just went up.

421
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,040
 Some of you feel some creep under your skin that that's heretical.

422
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
 That doesn't make sense.

423
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 That isn't correct.

424
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,880
 And yet let me just explain to you why I've written it the way it's written.

425
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,600
 You see, these two things, believing and becoming, they go hand in hand.

426
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,800
 And so it doesn't make sense that you can be one who believes in Christ and yet not

427
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,860
 one who becomes like Christ.

428
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,440
 It makes no sense whatsoever.

429
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,500
 There's no scriptural precedent that you could be one who has found Jesus but not following

430
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 after Jesus.

431
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,400
 It doesn't make sense.

432
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,520
 It's not in the word.

433
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,440
 And so I've written this for some shock and some awe to kind of catch our attention that

434
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:41,160
 Jesus, he desperately, desperately wants to lead you into becoming like Christ.

435
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,580
 Which means that we don't just tell people what they're saved from.

436
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,740
 We tell people what they're saved for.

437
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:57,060
 That they're saved for a relationship with God, deep connection to other people, a kind

438
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,060
 of diversity in the family that will grow them, stretch them, build them up, that they're

439
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,860
 connected to a life of significant meaning and impact and difference making.

440
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,960
 That's what's true for them now.

441
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,580
 They've been saved for that.

442
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,020
 And yet here's the reality.

443
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,820
 Often when we read the Great Commission, what we think of is evangelism.

444
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,940
 But what Jesus just said is it's about discipleship.

445
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,420
 That's what it's about.

446
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,860
 Like salvation, the purpose of evangelism, we often consider as essential.

447
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,860
 Yet discipleship is just kind of optional.

448
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,520
 Like salvation, that's the main mission.

449
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,220
 Discipleship is just kind of a side quest that some of us go on but you don't necessarily

450
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,140
 have to do.

451
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,900
 Not according to Jesus.

452
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,080
 That's not how he feels about this at all.

453
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,780
 You see, he wants to not only lead us into a life where we tell people what they're saved

454
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,980
 from but ultimately what they're saved for.

455
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,820
 Are you tracking with what I mean by that?

456
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
 Just catch it like this.

457
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,740
 No one gets married to save themselves from loneliness.

458
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,300
 If that's you, let me spare you the trouble.

459
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
 Buy a dog.

460
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,500
 If that's all you want to get married for, that will accomplish the purpose, ladies.

461
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,780
 Your dog will comfort you in the midst of your loneliness more than some man might.

462
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,500
 Don't fall prey to that idea.

463
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 Why?

464
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,580
 No one goes to the grocery store and picks the food they pick to save themselves from

465
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
 starvation.

466
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,980
 No, they pick the food they pick to give them the kind of joy that something really tasty

467
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,220
 has to offer.

468
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,780
 You're not just saved from something.

469
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,180
 You are saved for something.

470
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,540
 That's what Jesus is getting at here in the great commission.

471
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,340
 He wants the emphasis to not solely reside on people finding him but people following

472
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,540
 him.

473
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,500
 Now let me be really clear, really clear because I don't want the email.

474
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,340
 I'm not saying that we don't help people find Jesus.

475
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,820
 If you're hearing that from me, then you're not listening.

476
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:13,100
 Yes, and amen, we help people find Jesus.

477
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,380
 But you shouldn't be able to find Jesus and not follow him.

478
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,100
 You shouldn't be able to find him and not follow him.

479
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,060
 That doesn't make sense according to the word of God.

480
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,020
 Matthew 7, 1720, Jesus himself says, "So every healthy tree, it bears good fruit, but the

481
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,060
 diseased tree bears bad fruit.

482
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,300
 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.

483
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,820
 Every tree that does not bear good fruit, it's cut down, thrown into the fire.

484
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,820
 Thus, you will recognize the trees by their fruits."

485
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,820
 John 13, 34, 35, "A new commandment I give to you that you love one another.

486
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,500
 Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.

487
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 Do you catch it?

488
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,580
 Don't just believe, become, just as I've loved you, love one another.

489
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,700
 By this," guess what, "all people will know that you are my," what?

490
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
 My converts.

491
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,500
 No, "my disciples, if you love one another."

492
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,580
 James 1, 22-24 says, "Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves.

493
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,240
 Do what it says.

494
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,140
 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks

495
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,140
 at his face in a mirror and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets

496
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,220
 what he looks like."

497
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,040
 What are these verses saying?

498
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,340
 If you believe in him, you should become like him.

499
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,500
 Like true faith, it isn't just content in finding Jesus.

500
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 True faith is urgent in following after him.

501
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,620
 Christian, listen to me.

502
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,220
 If that doesn't put fire in your bones, then this message is for you.

503
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,660
 Then this message is for you because here's the reality.

504
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,260
 I think that so many of us, if we did a sincere evaluation, if we took a hard look in the

505
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,140
 mirror, if we just got really gut level honest with ourselves for a moment, what we would

506
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:19,140
 realize is that we claim to have found Jesus, we're not following Jesus at all.

507
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,500
 We're following something different instead.

508
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,820
 How do you know what it is you're following in life?

509
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,500
 Well take the advice of Instagram.

510
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,420
 You subscribe to the ones that you follow.

511
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,900
 And once you do, their influence fills your feed.

512
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,080
 If you want to know who you follow, then answer the question, whose influence fills the feed

513
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,180
 of your life?

514
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,740
 Whose influence fills the feed of your life?

515
00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:03,760
 Like when it comes to approval, are you influenced by what Jesus has to say about you?

516
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,000
 Are you listening instead to what everyone else, all of your peers have to say in contrast?

517
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,200
 Like when it comes to coping, are you influenced by the promises that Jesus has given you or

518
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:27,440
 are you persuaded instead to indulge some substance, some shopping, some subscription,

519
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,600
 some sexuality?

520
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,800
 When it comes to your security, like are you influenced by the fact that Jesus controls

521
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 everything?

522
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,480
 What an amazing reality.

523
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:48,920
 Or are you just trusting like your pocketbook to give you security in life instead?

524
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:55,400
 When it comes to your reputation, are you influenced by the fact that Jesus wants to

525
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,000
 make you into his image?

526
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,720
 Or are you more concerned with carefully crafting your image yourself?

527
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,540
 You see, Jesus wants you to follow him because you're going to follow something.

528
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,800
 So the question tonight is whose influence are you following?

529
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:27,360
 Porch, I need you to catch this because I love you enough to say this.

530
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:36,000
 If you're not following Jesus, then your purpose in life, it's impossible.

531
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,320
 It's impossible because you can't make followers of a Jesus that you are unwilling to follow

532
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,760
 yourself.

533
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,120
 No.

534
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:56,760
 No, you follow him because whatever it is you want to find, I promise you.

535
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,760
 It's yes and amen in him.

536
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,720
 Now as we talk through this, here's the thing.

537
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,360
 Some of you are really resonating, really jiving with this.

538
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,940
 Like you feel this deep desire, almost this desperation to like finally just like get

539
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,200
 out of what you're in.

540
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,920
 Like to stop riding one foot in, one foot out, but to go both feet of faith all the

541
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,920
 way into what God is wanting for your life.

542
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,340
 And yet you don't know where to start.

543
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,680
 If that's you, if you're desperately wanting to take action on these things tonight to

544
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,200
 actually live into the purpose that Jesus has for you, hear me, we want to help.

545
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:43,840
 And so I and the team, we have been working for months now to organize a way in which

546
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 we can do it.

547
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,160
 So starting in the new year, for the very first time ever in Porch history, we're doing

548
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,960
 something that we've never done.

549
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,020
 We're launching a discipleship initiative.

550
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,060
 And we want to invite you to come and be a part of it.

551
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,960
 If you're here and you're like, man, I want to make disciples, but I've never been made

552
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
 into a disciple.

553
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,080
 No one's ever shown me the ropes or taught me how to go, but I want to be spiritually

554
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
 developed.

555
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
 I want to be God.

556
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
 I want to grow in my godliness.

557
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,680
 I want to take ground and mature in Christ.

558
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,640
 If that's you, then this is for you.

559
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,660
 And we'd love to bring you on board and let you be a part of it.

560
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:23,040
 And so what you need to do is you just need to text the word discipleship to 40585.

561
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,000
 And what it'll do is it'll just, it'll lead you to an interest form.

562
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 That's all it is.

563
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 There's no hard commitment right now.

564
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,400
 We're not taking any money tonight.

565
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
 There's nothing like that happening.

566
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
 Okay.

567
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,040
 So you can just calm down.

568
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,840
 This is just an interest form.

569
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,400
 You're just simply saying, Hey man, like I care about it.

570
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
 I want to follow.

571
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
 I want to go all in.

572
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 I'm ready.

573
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,880
 I'm tired of hanging one foot out.

574
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
 I want to be all the way in with Jesus.

575
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,880
 And if that's you, then, then you need to scan this or you need to text this.

576
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,080
 And what'll happen is it'll lead you to a form.

577
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,280
 You'll fill out some info.

578
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
 We'll collect that.

579
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,320
 And then we will touch base with you in the new year when we launched this discipleship

580
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
 initiative.

581
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,440
 Now, let me say a couple of things.

582
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,520
 When you do so, there is a small barrier to entry because you've got to create a log in

583
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
 if you don't have one.

584
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,560
 I'm sorry.

585
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
 Wish we could remove that for you, make it easier.

586
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,440
 And yet if that's all it takes to throw you off the trail of following after Jesus and

587
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,240
 getting serious about your discipleship, then you're probably not ready for it.

588
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,680
 In reality, tough news.

589
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,880
 I promise you can do it.

590
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,960
 Others of you, you're here tonight and you're like, man, no, I have been discipled.

591
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
 I'm eager to learn the way in which I should go forward.

592
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,120
 We've got stuff for you too.

593
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,560
 So just hang with us because we believe that it's not just the disciple, but the disciple

594
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,400
 maker that we want to invest in as well.

595
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,640
 But here's the thing, and I just want to speak to you really straight about it because I'm

596
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,920
 really serious about this.

597
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:47,240
 If you're not serious about actually being a part of this, then will you just not, will

598
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,920
 you just not jump in?

599
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,160
 Because we're going to be really serious about the people that do.

600
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,600
 And I want to give them my whole yes, my undivided commitment to helping them grow in Christ

601
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
 likeness.

602
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,680
 And I would love for that to be you if you're here and you want to hop in.

603
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,440
 Now, a couple of things you should know.

604
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,640
 Number one, to PortsLive, this program is not built for you specifically, but what I

605
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,340
 guarantee you is your local church context does have something that they would love to

606
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
 invite you into.

607
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,940
 And so tonight what you need to do is you need to take action on just approaching a

608
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,480
 church leader and telling them, "Hey, I'm ready.

609
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,560
 I'm serious.

610
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,000
 I want to go all in.

611
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,360
 My chips aren't held back.

612
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,320
 They're pushed full forward.

613
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,360
 Help me grow in my godliness.

614
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,040
 Teach me to walk with Jesus.

615
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,240
 I want to be discipled."

616
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,360
 I promise you they would love to have that conversation and they will have a next step

617
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
 for you.

618
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,200
 The second thing that you all need to know is this isn't replacing Tuesday nights, okay?

619
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,840
 We're still going to gather, sit in this room, bring our friends, meet other friends, sing

620
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 to God, study his word.

621
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,540
 Our bread and butter is not changing.

622
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,300
 We just want to help you take a first step and help you take a next step.

623
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,460
 So that's what this all means.

624
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
 You tracking?

625
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
 Good?

626
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
 Okay.

627
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
 Now here's the thing.

628
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:09,220
 Some of you, when I unpack this idea, what happens is we get a really mixed bag of response.

629
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,240
 We fall in a wide variety of places because while we understand the call of Christ and

630
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,940
 what it means to go all in with Jesus and we even grasp the fact that this is a really

631
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,000
 noble cause, we feel some reservation, some hesitation, some trepidation of getting in

632
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,240
 with Christ, going in on this mission.

633
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,580
 We come up with plenty of reasons to find not to embrace this as our purpose.

634
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,220
 Let me just say this as plainly as possible.

635
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,980
 None of the reasons you find are good reasons because there are no good exceptions to the

636
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,300
 great commission.

637
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,380
 There are no good exceptions to the great commission.

638
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,180
 Like this isn't mission impossible.

639
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,100
 This isn't your mission should you choose to accept it.

640
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,580
 This isn't a message that's going to terminate in 10 seconds.

641
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,740
 No, this message is an impervious message because this call stands the test of time

642
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,340
 and goes over the course of all eternity until Christ himself comes back.

643
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,300
 This is your mission.

644
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,860
 He's come to make it clear.

645
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,500
 That's why he says, "Go, baptize and teach."

646
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,860
 Make disciples.

647
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
 You should go.

648
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
 You should baptize them.

649
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,740
 You should teach them all that I've commanded you.

650
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
 What is he unpacking there?

651
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,260
 Well, those three words, go, baptize and teach.

652
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,240
 They are present participles.

653
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,780
 Just to put your grammar hat on for a minute.

654
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,700
 And the reason they're added into this text and we're bringing them up right now is because

655
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,100
 what they do is they accentuate the main command of the passage.

656
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:49,080
 Like it's the same idea as if you had a picture that was set in black and white, yet you chose

657
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,500
 to add color to it.

658
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
 What would happen?

659
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,020
 The picture itself would not change and yet the vibrancy of the photo, it would increase.

660
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,460
 It would get better because you've accentuated it appropriately.

661
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,660
 That's what these present participles are doing to Christ's command.

662
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
 But they're not just doing that.

663
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,700
 They're not just qualifying what it means to make disciples.

664
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,100
 What they're doing is they're also in the process building an indestructible defense

665
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:19,080
 to the fact that there are no good exceptions to following this command if you follow Jesus.

666
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
 How do they do that?

667
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,940
 Well, we're going to go through this quick just for the sake of time.

668
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,380
 But when he says go in the Greek, that does not mean get up and go.

669
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,700
 Some of you should absolutely get up and go.

670
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,700
 We are firm believers that God is not just a God of this nation.

671
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,080
 He is a God of all nations and we need to extend the gospel to the utmost ends of the

672
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
 earth.

673
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,500
 Tonight, there's an Ethiopia interest meeting and some of you need to go because he is calling

674
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,900
 you to get up and go.

675
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,140
 And yet what we know in this passage is that's not the primary idea.

676
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,580
 The primary idea here is as you are going.

677
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,700
 That's what this word in the Greek means.

678
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,740
 It means that as you go, make disciples.

679
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,540
 Which sucks the error out of the first exception that many of us hide behind.

680
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,340
 That Jesus, I just don't have time to do it.

681
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,900
 Because according to Jesus, you don't find time to disciple.

682
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,940
 You disciple wherever your time is found.

683
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,140
 So if your time is found at the gym, disciple there.

684
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,220
 If your time is found at the grocery store, disciple there.

685
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,860
 If your time is found at the office, disciple there.

686
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,100
 If your time is found at spin, disciple there.

687
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,340
 You disciple wherever it is you are.

688
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,700
 You disciple as you go.

689
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:41,380
 According to Eugene Peterson, 90%, 90% of Jesus' time was spent ministering to his disciples.

690
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,500
 Not speaking to large crowds, not teaching in synagogue, not speaking with strangers,

691
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,140
 but ministering to his disciples.

692
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
 How is that possible?

693
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,440
 90% of his time.

694
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,900
 Because Jesus, he believed that discipleship, the majority of discipleship was meant to

695
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,980
 be informal in nature.

696
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,580
 That it happened as you go.

697
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,340
 Between meals, on the way to a meeting, in the car, going to serve these people, then

698
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,220
 making your way over here, there next.

699
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,020
 He believed that that's what it meant to make disciples.

700
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,140
 You do it as you go along.

701
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,820
 The majority of discipleship happens in the informal moment.

702
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,340
 Here's the problem with us here in the West.

703
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:26,140
 We believe that all discipleship happens in the formal moment.

704
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,780
 Happens at Bible study, happens at equipping night, happens at community group, happens

705
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,760
 whenever I show up to that coffee once a week.

706
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,740
 We think that that's where discipleship happens, and yet that's not what Jesus is saying.

707
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,380
 Those things are not bad.

708
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,380
 You should absolutely do those things.

709
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,860
 You should come to Sunday service.

710
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,900
 You should be involved in a community group.

711
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,740
 You should join a Bible study, and yet you can't look at those things and say, "That

712
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,540
 scratches my discipleship itch."

713
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,540
 You also can't say that attending services like this and letting the professionals do

714
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,180
 the discipling is your way out, because that's not what Jesus is saying.

715
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:06,380
 He's saying, "No, you, where you are, as you are, how you are, make disciples, and do it

716
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,980
 as you go."

717
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,540
 That's the first thing we need to know.

718
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,780
 The second thing that he says is we baptize them.

719
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:20,020
 Now, I'll admit, whenever I heard that we're supposed to baptize all nations, it didn't

720
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,380
 really make sense to be in the Great Commission.

721
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,940
 It didn't feel like it fits.

722
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,220
 All the other things, they make sense.

723
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:33,260
 This is Jesus' final mission to us as his people, so go and save and teach.

724
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,500
 Baptism just didn't fit in there, because I know, man, baptism, it's an external expression

725
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,340
 of an internal reality, but why the urgency?

726
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,100
 Why is it included in the Great Commission?

727
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,580
 For this reason, don't miss this, because this is massively important, because we need

728
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:56,340
 to know baptism is not just a symbol of connection to Christ, it is a symbol of connection to

729
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,100
 community.

730
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:04,180
 That's why it's available to all people everywhere, every tribe, every tongue, every nation.

731
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:10,340
 We should go and tell them all about the connection they can have to the family of God, which

732
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,060
 is made available through the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

733
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:20,700
 It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from, what you've done, you're now going to

734
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,980
 be a part of God's family, which blows apart the second exception I often hear people hiding

735
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,660
 behind, which is, "But I don't have anything in common with them."

736
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,660
 According to Jesus, you do.

737
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,660
 You don't have to share all the similarities in the world.

738
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,620
 You don't have to like the same music, have the same hobbies, go to the same places, come

739
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,380
 from the same socioeconomic background, you don't have to have an immense amount of similarities,

740
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,300
 because what you have is a singular commonality in Christ, and that is the most significant

741
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,260
 commonality you can have.

742
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,020
 So what's beautiful about the people of God, the family of God, is that we're a people

743
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:06,740
 in unity, bound by our love for one another, yet not a people of uniformity that look like

744
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,740
 one another.

745
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:15,140
 We're a people that are diverse, we're a people that are different, yet united in Christ.

746
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,300
 And lastly, Jesus tells us to teach them to observe all that I commanded you.

747
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,460
 This one's pretty easy to understand, and yet it's often the one that we find hardest

748
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,940
 to follow and often find ourselves hiding behind, because when it comes to discipleship,

749
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,500
 so many of us, we don't know what to say.

750
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,460
 Like what if they ask a question, I don't have the answer?

751
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,500
 What if I'm supposed to teach something, but I don't know what to say?

752
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:39,060
 What if I'm not eloquent enough to communicate that to these people so they will believe?

753
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,020
 Just really simply, what I would say in this moment is that Christ doesn't need you to

754
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,020
 be perfect.

755
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,300
 That's not what he's looking for.

756
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,220
 He doesn't need you to be perfect, he just needs you to be faithful.

757
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,820
 He just needs you to know, man, if you've got a couple of steps in spiritual maturity

758
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,060
 on someone else, you can help them by bringing them up those couple of steps to greater spiritual

759
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,060
 maturity.

760
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,820
 So teach, so speak, so share, and know that, man, he'll work out the difference.

761
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,340
 He'll move because of your faithfulness.

762
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,180
 You see, there's no good exceptions to the Great Commission, none.

763
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,140
 Doesn't matter what you're hiding behind.

764
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,940
 It's an invisible wall, we can see you.

765
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,180
 But there are only good reasons to keep it.

766
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:28,940
 And yet here's the thing that I know, and it's the fear that I've had, and the very

767
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:35,200
 reason that we've stepped into this series, is I know we can give you eight weeks of content

768
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:42,700
 on discipleship, and you can be here and enjoy all of the acquisition of new knowledge, and

769
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,100
 yet walk away and be totally satisfied that you know more about Jesus, but you don't know

770
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,240
 Jesus personally.

771
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,820
 If that's you, how do you avoid that from happening?

772
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,300
 Well, last story, and admittedly, I'm borrowing this from J.D. Greer.

773
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,220
 In the Civil War, President Lincoln couldn't have hoped for a better general than he found

774
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,500
 in the Union's General-in-Chief, George McClellan.

775
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,620
 George was known as the young Napoleon because he was tactically brilliant, unlike anybody

776
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,620
 else.

777
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,360
 At just the age of 15, he was the youngest member actually invited into the U.S. Military

778
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,960
 Academy, and despite being so young, he nevertheless graduated at the top of his class.

779
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,080
 Upon graduating, he went into the service, and he did the unthinkable.

780
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,480
 He began to recruit people like no one had ever known before, so much so that the volunteer

781
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,400
 regiment grew by 300% in just four months' time.

782
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,480
 He was tactically brilliant.

783
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,900
 He was strategically intelligent.

784
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,400
 He was winsome to the masses, and so it was no surprise that President Lincoln made him

785
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,280
 General-in-Chief.

786
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,440
 He had the experience, the expertise, and he had the woo to bring people on board.

787
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,400
 He had everything he needed except one thing.

788
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,460
 He didn't have the willingness to fight because what we know is that for weeks, General McClellan

789
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,560
 readied his position.

790
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,780
 He organized his troops, and he strategized against his enemy, outnumbered two to one.

791
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,980
 His opponent, General Robert E. Lee's army, lay dangerously exposed just a few miles away.

792
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,720
 They were within quick reach of crushing the rebellion, ending the war, and bringing peace

793
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,060
 to the nation again, and yet, despite understanding the strategy, despite knowing all the odds,

794
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:39,700
 despite having all the men necessary, General McClellan did not have the willingness.

795
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,800
 He went a bold and a very surprising move.

796
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:49,420
 President Lincoln removed George McClellan from his position, and in place of the most

797
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:56,200
 tactically brilliant person they had known in their modern military, he put someone else

798
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:09,600
 instead, one that was half the strategic intelligence of George McClellan, but one that was altogether

799
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,800
 more bold and brazen for battle.

800
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:27,000
 He instituted Ulysses S. Grant as the Union's new general, and within a year, General Grant

801
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,600
 brought the Civil War to an end.

802
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,740
 The difference in these two men and the legacies they left revolved around their willingness

803
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,740
 to fight.

804
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,480
 It didn't depend on which was smarter.

805
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,160
 It didn't depend on which was more admired.

806
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,000
 It didn't depend on which was more talented.

807
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,060
 It depended on which was more willing.

808
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,000
 How willing are you to fight here tonight?

809
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,600
 How willing are you to not just know the right things, to not just say the right things,

810
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,200
 to pray the right things, to even believe the right things, but to actually become the

811
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,660
 right things, do the right things, and take the right action?

812
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,960
 How willing are you to do it?

813
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,380
 Here's the thing I know.

814
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,280
 We have every reason in the world to be willing because Jesus Christ himself was willing to

815
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,480
 enter into the fight.

816
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,440
 What we know about Jesus is he was willing to die for the sake of sinners and skeptics

817
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,480
 and screw-ups, so much so that he took our cross upon himself and he bore the consequence

818
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,480
 of our sin.

819
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,120
 We know that Jesus was willing to rise, that we might be more than mere believers.

820
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,400
 We might be becomers, people that become like Jesus because he didn't stay dead nor buried

821
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,120
 in the grave, but he rose forth so that we might rise alongside of him.

822
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,960
 And we know that Jesus, he was willing to give us good reason for the great commission,

823
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:02,240
 a mission that saves the world one person at a time, by one person at a time.

824
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,200
 Jesus has a purpose for you, porch.

825
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,680
 The last regular porch of the year, he has a purpose for you.

826
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,480
 If only you're willing, and here's what I promise, it is a purpose worth living for

827
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:23,440
 because it's a purpose Christ found worth dying for.

828
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
 Let me pray for us.

829
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,600
 God, I know we went long tonight.

830
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,720
 Yeah, God, if we're going to give our time to anyone, let it be given to you, to your

831
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,040
 word and to this mission, which is most important of all.

832
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:44,480
 God, I pray, Lord, that you would embed this truth into our bones.

833
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,680
 That God, as we step into the holiday season, we would do so without passivity, but filled

834
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,520
 God with great passion, that we have a purpose, one worthy of living for you.

835
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,480
 Jesus found it worthy of dying for.

836
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,360
 So God, I pray, help us to take next steps, to know that God, it doesn't take this room

837
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,400
 to save souls.

838
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,640
 It takes your people to do it instead.

839
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,860
 Make us like yourself.

840
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,520
 Make the world like yourself for your glory and our good, we pray in Jesus' name.

841
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,280
 Amen.
