[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:26.640]   Love it.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   Check, check.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.440]   There we go.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.720]   Hey, welcome, friends.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.800]   Man, this group is excited.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.300]   This--
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.760]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.200]   I'm just confused.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.080]   Thank you.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.160]   Good night, everybody.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.640]   Thank you.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320]   Hey, take a seat.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.920]   Hey, we are continuing this series.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.420]   If you're joining us from elsewhere,
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.040]   you're confused like I am.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   And we are so excited to continue this series,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.000]   asking for a friend.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.200]   And welcome in the room.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.320]   Welcome in Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.240]   wherever you are joining us from as we continue this series.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.680]   Man, you guys, that was great.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   It was clothes in prayer.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.840]   Hey, let me start by saying this.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.540]   Before I got married, there were certain purchases
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.240]   that were allowed in my life.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360]   And one of them was I, at some point in time,
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920]   was into remote control helicopters.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.560]   Gentlemen, that's going to go.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.320]   But at that time in my life, I was single.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.160]   I had gone and purchased one.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.440]   And I had brought it home.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720]   And it was this enormous one that, for some reason,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.840]   I was really excited about.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.960]   And I purchased it.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.160]   And I had a friend that was hanging out that night.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.000]   And I was like, dude, let's go fly this thing
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.480]   and see how far and how fast and how well it flies.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.200]   So we go outside.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.860]   We take it out.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.400]   And we begin to fly this helicopter.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   And things are going fine.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   And I'm controlling it.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   And it's up in the air.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.560]   And I begin to realize, I'm not sure I
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.880]   have control over this thing.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.080]   I'm moving the buttons around.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840]   And it's not corresponding with the things
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.160]   that I am moving my hands around.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.000]   And I begin to realize that this thing, it's
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.440]   just beginning to take off.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   It's got a mind of its own.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.120]   True story.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   And it's just going off, kind of aimlessly
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.200]   flying through the air.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.300]   And it's sailing past.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.440]   For whatever reason, it had gotten disconnected
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   from the controller.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   This thing was trying to guide it.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.520]   So I just began taking off, running after it
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.680]   to try to get back within distance to allow the signal.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.720]   You would think it would just drop out of the air.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.160]   It didn't drop out of the air.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.860]   Probably because I bought it at Walmart.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.200]   But this thing just took off.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   And nothing against Walmart.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.040]   But it just took off and began flying.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.080]   And I'm chasing over.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.200]   And it begins to go over the houses behind our house
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.840]   and past some trees.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   And it's gone.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   And I'm like, what just happened?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.200]   So we get in my buddy's truck.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.240]   And we just begin driving up and down the alleys.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.160]   And I'm holding the remote out the window,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.360]   hoping that we're going to cross some house.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.920]   And I'm going to reconnect with the signal
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560]   and be able to pick this thing back up.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.600]   Because I know it's either still flying somewhere,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   or it's in someone's backyard.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   But eventually, it's going to run out of batteries.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440]   Or it's going to get run over if it lands on the street.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.760]   And all the fun that was to be had
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.920]   was not going to take place.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.440]   And so we spend the next few hours trying to do that.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   But the reason I start there is because in that scenario, what
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.680]   had happened was this helicopter--
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.320]   this is such a ridiculous story--
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560]   this helicopter had lost connection with the controller,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   with this thing that was supposed to guide it
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.920]   and direct it to be providing instructions on where to go.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   And in doing so, it just kind of spiraled out of control,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.840]   began to wander aimlessly, eventually ran out of batteries.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   So never found it.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   True story.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.320]   It was like, one hit wonder.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.120]   There we go.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.640]   And in being disconnected from kind
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.600]   of the source of instruction, which was just the controller,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.000]   and disconnected from the source of guidance or something
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.560]   to guide it, it just spiraled out of control.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.880]   And eventually, ran out of batteries
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.120]   somewhere, on somebody's house or something.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.960]   But it was no longer connected to something
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.800]   that was there to provide it direction and guidance.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.420]   Now, what does that have to do with what
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.160]   we're talking about tonight?
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   When you open the Bible, the way that the Bible talks
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.560]   about itself-- in other words, the way
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.760]   that the scriptures speak of itself--
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.680]   is that they are to be much like a control--
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.160]   or controller in that situation--
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.440]   a source of direction and guidance in your life
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   to keep you from aimlessly wandering,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.080]   to keep you from eventually just burning out and running out
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.160]   of energy, to keep you from not experiencing the purpose you
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.960]   were created for.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.040]   That the Bible is there not to be
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560]   a source of control in your life,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.520]   but a source of guidance inside of your life
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.480]   to protect you from spiraling out of control,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   just like that helicopter in that situation.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   This is what the churches always really
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   believe, that the Bible and New Testament,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.720]   the writings of the scripture in general,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.800]   are there to lead us to life, to be a source of guidance
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920]   and direction in our life.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   Tonight, as we continue this series,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.320]   we're going to talk about why you and I can trust the Bible,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   why believers can trust the Bible.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.240]   Because just like in that scenario,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.440]   or just like the Bible tells about itself,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.680]   if you're not--
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.880]   if we can't trust the Bible--
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.320]   in other words, if it's not true,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.880]   if it's not really a source of guidance inside of our life,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.360]   and we can't trust the words that it says,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.720]   there is a lot at stake.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.600]   Not just eternity, as if that wasn't enough,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.240]   of eternally in heaven or eternally in hell.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.760]   In other words, if the Bible is not true,
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.160]   it's not trustworthy, it's not reliable,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.880]   then there is not just eternal life at stake,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.840]   there's this life at stake.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.360]   There's meaning, purpose, a relationship with God,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.840]   direction in life, the point of you knowing
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   or experiencing, having an understanding
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.840]   of what life is all about.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   If the Bible, if we can't trust that, all of that is gone.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.520]   If we can't trust the Bible, really, candidly,
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.000]   all we're doing right now is wasting our time.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.200]   And so there's a lot at stake.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.920]   In other words, there's a lot better things.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.840]   There's like margarita deals on Tuesday night,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.720]   there's a lot better things we could do on a Tuesday night
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.040]   if the Bible is not true, and we should probably
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.160]   shut this thing down and get on with it.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.400]   But if it is true, then there is no length,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.640]   we cannot go far enough to live by it,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.960]   to allow it to guide our life, because if it is true,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.040]   it says it is a source of guidance from God himself,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.620]   who wants to lead you and I to life,
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.080]   who doesn't wanna rip you off, is not sitting around
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   being like, man, I just really wanna control you
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.320]   and keep you from fun.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.260]   He's a God who wants you to experience
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.060]   the greatest life possible.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.840]   And so we're gonna talk about, hey, can you trust the Bible?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.880]   Because if we can't, everything's lost.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.160]   And so why and how can Christians trust the Bible?
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.340]   So we're gonna look at five things, really, five Ps
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.160]   that will be a starting point for why Christians
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.000]   trust the Bible, 'cause we live in a world,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.920]   I live in the same world that you do,
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.760]   that constantly is saying, hey, you know,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.880]   the Bible's been changed over time,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.160]   it's been translated so many times,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.760]   can we really know what it says?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.880]   There's so many different interpretations of it,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.080]   who really knows?
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.400]   Wasn't it written by men?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   I mean, are we sure that this is the words of God?
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, I'm sure there's some great stories in there,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   but can we really trust it?
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   And I'm gonna do my best to present the evidence
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.000]   that God has made it abundantly clear,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.280]   history has showcased that it is abundantly clear
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.760]   that God's word can, should, and must be trusted.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   So we're gonna look at five principles, if you will,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.840]   around why Christians trust the Bible.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.480]   And they kind of build on one another.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.360]   So if you take notes, you can write the five things
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.960]   why Christians trust the Bible.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.320]   The first will just be a launching pad,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.920]   end of the conversation is establishing the fact
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.880]   about what the Bible professes to be.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.600]   The first thing is, what does the Bible profess about itself?
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.800]   In other words, what does the Bible say that it is?
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.760]   Here's what the Bible says.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   In 2 Timothy, I'm sorry, 2 Peter 1, verses 20 and 21,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.520]   Peter writes and he says this,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.800]   "That no prophecy of scripture," that's the Bible,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   "comes from someone's own interpretation.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.180]   "No prophecy was ever produced by the will of man,
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.560]   "but men spoke from God as they were carried along
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.400]   "by the Holy Spirit."
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.240]   What are you saying, Peter?
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.000]   Peter is saying that the way that the Bible was recorded
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.400]   was that God directed man to write down certain things
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.220]   and certain things to be included in the scripture.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.040]   That's just what the Bible says about itself.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.040]   In 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy chapter three, verses 16 and 17,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.240]   Timothy says this, "All scripture is breathed out by God
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.340]   "or God-inspired, is useful for teaching, rebuking,
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.120]   "correcting, training, and righteousness,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.300]   "so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.240]   "for every good work."
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.680]   Now what does that prove?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.560]   It doesn't prove anything.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.360]   If you're going, oh man, so the Bible claims
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.100]   to be the word of God, does that prove it?
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.800]   No, I mean, you have a crazy uncle
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.080]   who claims to be a billy goat.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.040]   It doesn't mean he's a billy goat,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.840]   but it does establish into the conversation
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.140]   that the Bible claims to be.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.980]   In other words, if people are like,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.560]   I don't think the Bible ever says it's that big of a deal,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.080]   it says it's a big deal.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.340]   In fact, 2 Peter, or Peter, writing in 2 Peter chapter three
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.800]   later on in that same book, he further establishes
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.560]   that the New Testament writings,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.360]   specifically the writings of Paul,
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   he specifically addresses, are considered scripture.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.680]   Here's what he says.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.720]   I don't know if they have these verses up there.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.080]   2 Peter chapter three, verses 15 and 16.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.040]   Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.860]   just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.320]   with the wisdom that God gave him.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   He writes in the same way in all his letters,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.280]   speaking of these matters.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.880]   His letters contain some things that are hard to understand,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.680]   which ignorant and unstable people distort
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.800]   as they do the other scriptures to their own destruction.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.640]   What are you saying?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.480]   That's what Peter says.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.000]   Because he really says what a lot of us,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.380]   if you've ever read Paul's letters,
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.040]   have experienced from time to time,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.240]   where it's like, man, what are you trying to say?
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.360]   Even Peter is like, look, I hear you've been reading Paul,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.840]   and I get it, it's a little confusing.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.400]   Does he realize we're fishermen?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.200]   But at the same time, it may be a little complex,
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.480]   but it is the words of God that Peter believed
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.660]   that Paul, in his letters, was writing scripture.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.480]   So what does that prove?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.720]   It proves that the Bible professes to be the word of God.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   Is that conclusive evidence?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.520]   No, but it's a starting point as we investigate
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   the truth and why Christians trust the Bible.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.040]   So the first is that it professes to be the word of God.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.280]   The second reason that I think gives us grounds
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.420]   for why we can trust the Bible is its production.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.040]   That's the second thing.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.340]   The production of the scripture is unbelievable.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.760]   If you spend any time, regardless of your faith background,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.660]   regardless really of what you believe,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:37.720]   the 66 books that make up the Bible
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.460]   that were written over 2,000 years by 40 different authors
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.560]   in three different languages on multiple continents
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.480]   that all profess the same storyline,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.800]   that all tell of the storyline of the God
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.660]   who has made provision for humanity,
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.080]   that God in the storyline of the Bible
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.480]   is essentially God's pursuit and God's plan for redemption
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.120]   in our world of sending his own son
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.600]   to be the savior of that world.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.660]   The Old Testament, all of it points to Jesus.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.200]   The New Testament, all of it talks about Jesus.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.080]   And even the production is a remarkable thing
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.280]   that it would have that same consistent message
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.320]   over thousands of years by different men
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.520]   who'd never met each other,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.720]   who wrote in different centuries
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.820]   and yet spoke of the same storyline.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.920]   They spoke from palaces, prisons, wildernesses,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.680]   places of exile.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.360]   They spoke of history, or they wrote historical books,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.240]   law books, poetry, prophecy, proverbs,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.520]   New Testament letters and gospel accounts,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.880]   all with this underlying cohesive message together
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.100]   of God's plan to redeem the world
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.320]   by sending his son, Jesus.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.900]   The Bible is not a single book, in other words.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.120]   A lot of times you hear, man, it's just this one single book.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.480]   It's not like Harry Potter.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.640]   It is a collection of 66 books that God,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.480]   throughout history, preserved
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.660]   and provided for his church to know.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.860]   In fact, the word Bible means the books.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.980]   That's just what la Biblia,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.180]   or where we get that word from, the books.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.200]   And even in the production,
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.860]   we see it smacks of divine order
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.420]   that you would have spread out over centuries
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.220]   the same message from different men
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.300]   in different languages on different continents.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.680]   Even some of the authors in the New Testament
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.920]   are, I think, some of the strongest evidence
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.420]   for why we can trust the New Testament and what it says.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.300]   In other words, the storyline of the guys
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.140]   who are writing the Bible,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.900]   because I don't know if you know this,
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.020]   the guys who wrote particularly the New Testament,
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.040]   really all of it,
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.540]   they weren't straight out of vacation Bible school.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.180]   These dudes were all guys who had a past.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.300]   I mean, you look at 'em,
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.820]   and each one of 'em provides a convincing,
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.260]   some evidence for why, man, this could be trustworthy.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.100]   Let's take Matthew.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.020]   Matthew, I don't know what you know about Matthew.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.580]   Matthew wrote the Gospel of,
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.500]   Matthew, there we go.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.700]   This is a sharp audience.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.340]   And Matthew was like, dude,
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.800]   he's a first century mafia member.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.640]   That's what Matthew did.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.540]   He's a tax collector.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.380]   He's a guy who had no religious background,
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.340]   had nothing to do with God,
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.820]   didn't wanna have anything to do with God.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.460]   He meets Jesus, his life becomes transformed.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.340]   He sees his resurrected Savior, Jesus,
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.140]   and he gives his life for that Savior,
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.660]   gives his life for that message.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.960]   A guy who did not grow up in church,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.460]   did not wanna have anything to do with God.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.200]   He's essentially in the mafia.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.140]   That's what a tax collector would have been in that day.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.820]   He encounters Jesus, everything changes.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.640]   Who else?
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.340]   Who else has a story that would be involved there?
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.000]   Let's look at James and Jude.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.160]   James and Jude were the baby brothers of Jesus.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.660]   As we said before, we said recently around here
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.400]   that man, they were the baby brothers of Jesus.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.240]   And you know what?
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.700]   They didn't believe that their brother was anything special.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.340]   We're told even in the Gospels that like,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.820]   hey, the family of Jesus was like,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.020]   dude, what are you doing, Jesus?
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.860]   You're embarrassing us.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.280]   You're claiming to be God.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.120]   Get him back in here.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.400]   Mom, let's bring him home.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.300]   They did not believe.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.620]   I mean, what would it take for you to believe
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.820]   that your sibling was the son of God?
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.420]   Think about it.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.540]   Anybody have a sibling that are like, you know,
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.420]   they're pretty special.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.380]   I'll be, I mean, you'd be like,
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.000]   I don't care what anyone says.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.100]   I grew up with a guy, I know him,
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.260]   not son of God.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:07.500]   Until James and Jude saw their big brother die
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.800]   and come back alive and everything changed.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.520]   And they said, my big brother is my Messiah.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.700]   He's my savior.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.420]   These weren't men that always believed.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.380]   They didn't ever believe until the resurrection
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.060]   and everything changed.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.780]   I mean, what do you think about Paul?
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.540]   Even the New Testament author Paul smacks
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.780]   of just God's divine intervention in someone's life,
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.660]   testifying to the truth of Jesus,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.500]   who he said he was,
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.060]   of what the scripture promised of the resurrection.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.460]   Paul was the artist formerly known as Saul.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.620]   Saul did not like Christians.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.620]   Maybe you're in the room and you have had bad experiences
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.420]   around church, around Christians.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   Pales in comparison to Paul.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.560]   Paul, or Saul, he had a name change midway through,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.740]   he spent half of his life trying to stomp out Christianity.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.580]   He wasn't just like, you know, I'm not a huge,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.900]   I'm not a big religious guy.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.540]   He was like, oh, I'm a super religious guy
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.220]   and I'm an anti-Christian guy.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.300]   And he spent his first half of his life
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.420]   trying to stomp out Christianity.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.900]   He oversaw the death of Christians.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.580]   And then one day he meets Jesus and everything changed
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.860]   and God used him to write close to 3/4
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.900]   of the New Testament.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.860]   Author after author, I mean, these weren't men
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.740]   who were just like, you know,
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.100]   I've always been a part of this
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.260]   and I really believe in the cause.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.700]   There were men who didn't believe
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.540]   and their life was transformed.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.980]   The production itself smacks
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.880]   of the divine intervention of our God.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.820]   So as we continue, why do Christians believe?
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.320]   One, it's the profession.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.380]   Two, it's production.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.660]   Clearly seems to capture something
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.980]   extraordinary taking place.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.700]   And then number three, it's preservation.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.540]   This next one is remarkable to me.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.780]   Like this is crazy.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.140]   In other words, what do I mean by preservation?
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.220]   So New Testament is written
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.140]   and I'm gonna focus primarily on the New Testament,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.940]   which is the second half of the Bible.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.420]   And New Testament is written
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.060]   and all of these different letters and gospels,
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.940]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.420]   and then the letters that are written inside of there.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.020]   Because Christianity, dude, it like explodes.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.660]   I mean, it goes from like this Jewish carpenter peasant
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.840]   who all of a sudden rises from the dead
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.320]   and things begin to take off pretty well.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.640]   And it explodes everywhere.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.960]   And people are coming to faith left and right.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.440]   And it really begins to spread
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.680]   all throughout the Roman Empire.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.840]   So what happens?
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.500]   These letters and these accounts,
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.600]   these four gospels and the letters of Paul,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.280]   people begin to go, I want a copy of those.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.040]   So copies are made of the letters of Paul
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.400]   and of the gospel accounts.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.840]   And they're spread all over the place
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.960]   and copy after copy is made
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.000]   because people are like, dude,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.680]   if I can have one of those letters,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.760]   one of those letters, we'll read it every day in church,
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.600]   please can you get us one?
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.160]   And so these letters are all of a sudden spread
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.200]   all over the ancient world.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.560]   We call them manuscripts or just copies.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.480]   That's just a big word for copies.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.680]   Now, what does this have to do with anything
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.440]   about why we can trust the Bible?
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.320]   Because the manuscripts that we have,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.200]   if we can't trust the preservation of those manuscripts
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.480]   because of the extraordinary amount of them
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.600]   and the extraordinary quality of them,
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.400]   we can't trust any book from the ancient world.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   The manuscripts that we have,
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.400]   they are an unbelievable abundance of riches
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.320]   as it compares to we not only know what the original said,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.920]   we have thousands and thousands of copies
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.180]   that confirm that the message of the Bible
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.520]   has not been changed.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.760]   Copies that go back not to like,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.360]   you know, the Da Vinci Code 400 BC,
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.520]   or I mean AD or, you know, 1000,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   go back to 90 AD.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.880]   We have copies unlike any other ancient book of the world.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.720]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.560]   Well, let's compare it.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.200]   We have tons of copies from the ancient world.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   You know, when you look at other books by comparison,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.640]   let's talk about some of those.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   When you look at the, who's heard of Caesar in the room?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.240]   Okay, good.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.000]   I was about to make a joke.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.840]   That would be inappropriate.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.080]   Okay, Caesar was a guy,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.720]   and he was the, essentially, emperor of the day.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.920]   Caesar, there's a book called Caesar's Lives.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.880]   If you've ever studied anything about Roman history
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.800]   and the Caesars, we have 10 manuscripts
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.960]   from which we pull all of our understanding of Caesar.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.320]   Everything that we've ever known about Caesar,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.840]   everything if you've ever studied in that,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.400]   comes from 10 manuscripts.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.480]   Who's heard of Plato?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.880]   If you've heard of Plato in the room,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.260]   what do we have from Plato?
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.400]   What type of copies or manuscripts do we have from him?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.560]   Seven.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.160]   We have seven ancient manuscripts,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.600]   which is just pre-printing press.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.180]   Seven from the ancient world.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.880]   Tacitus, if you studied,
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.080]   if you were a history major like me,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.160]   you would have studied Tacitus.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.800]   Tacitus was the primary source
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.660]   for all Roman history that we have.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.320]   How many copies do we have of Tacitus' writing?
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.160]   20.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.960]   All right, well, how many do we have of the New Testament?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   You guessed it, 24,633.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.640]   [congregation laughing]
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.840]   And you may be going like, oh man,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.920]   is that really a fair comparison?
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.520]   I mean, maybe those are just kind of light.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.320]   Let's look at second place.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.640]   Second place, the most second widely documented book
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.720]   from the ancient world is Homer's Iliad,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.960]   which has 634.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.920]   We have 24,000 more copies of the New Testament
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.960]   than we do of the second closest book
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.320]   in all of manuscripts or copies
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.080]   from before the printing press,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.240]   partly because of the explosion of Christianity.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.840]   And people saw this as the living, active word of God.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.200]   And they said, we need to hold onto this.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.040]   We need to preserve it.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.200]   We need to do everything that we can to protect it.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.240]   And these aren't copies that dated years later.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.760]   They're copies that were dated all the way back to 90 AD.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.920]   One has been arguably dated at 60 AD,
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.680]   right around the time of when the Gospels
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.200]   and all these things were being written.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   Are there changes inside of the 24,000?
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.920]   So if you've ever heard somebody before,
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.140]   I don't know if you turn on the TV and someone's like,
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.640]   well, the Bible's been translated so many times,
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.720]   who can we really know?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.600]   You probably have heard like,
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   there's a bunch of changes
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.500]   inside of the different manuscripts.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.800]   The bad news is there are changes.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   There's differences.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.440]   There's thousands of differences.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.920]   But do you know what the differences are like?
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.480]   In case it just kind of got you a little bit,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.360]   what, there's some changes inside of there?
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.720]   Let me walk through what the differences are.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   99.5%, this comes from a New Testament,
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.760]   one of the leading New Testament papyrologists
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.160]   and New Testament scholars in the world.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.360]   99.5%, Dan Wallace is his name,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.120]   99.5% of the changes,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.720]   the differences between those manuscripts,
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.040]   all fall into three categories.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.000]   This is about to be really boring,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.200]   what I'm about to say,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.520]   but it's the only way I can actually answer intellectually
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.620]   to someone who's like, no, dude,
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.440]   my grandma told me the Bible's been changed.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.320]   It hasn't been changed,
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.680]   and your grandma's wrong.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.520]   And so stay with me.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.260]   99.5% of any differences between those 24,000,
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.100]   guess what category?
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.120]   99.5, that's not a made up like stat.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.560]   99.5% fall into three categories,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.200]   spelling differences, John being spelled with two Ns.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.720]   Oh, that's a mistake.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   That counts.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.360]   That's the biggest difference is spelling differences.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.060]   70% are spelling differences.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.020]   The second one is changes that are not even translatable
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.220]   into English because they deal with the particle the.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.480]   In other words, sometimes it said,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.680]   hey, this one said the John loves Jesus,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.340]   this one says John loves Jesus.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.040]   Time out, not God's word, okay?
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.880]   Done here.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.900]   That's what when people say, they're saying.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.720]   And go research it for yourself.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.880]   I mean, man, so, maybe the best encouragement
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   you can leave it at night with is like,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.720]   begin to research and think for yourself.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.640]   Stop trusting YouTube comments that are like,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.280]   Bible is wrong, user 09,
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.000]   and trusting that that guy's right.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.920]   And just go research it for yourself.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.400]   I don't know if you live,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.760]   it feels like our world continues
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.380]   to just not paint the truth.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.960]   Just tell us the facts and stop painting some narrative
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.760]   about how the Bible's been changed.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.480]   It's ridiculous.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.840]   So what about that 0.5%?
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.660]   May not be much,
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.720]   but that could be something significant, couldn't it?
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.880]   Stay with me, 'cause this is about to get even more boring.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.440]   In grad school, we had to study that 0.5%.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.840]   And you may be like, oh, that could be cool.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.080]   Like, I wanna see what the big differences here are
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.960]   inside of the New Testament that have been changed.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.080]   Let me give you a couple of them,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.040]   because these are about as exciting as it gets.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.840]   Here's one, comes from a manuscript
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.320]   that covers 1 Thessalonians chapter two, verse seven.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.640]   And one manuscript says this,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.160]   or most of them say this,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.320]   but we were gentle among you,
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.820]   like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.000]   But we found an older manuscript that says this,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.540]   but we were like infants among you,
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.760]   like a nursing mother taking care of her children.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.060]   In Greek, the word between gentle and infants
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.680]   is one letter difference, napiori, apiori.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.080]   Napiori, napiori.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.240]   And so which one is it?
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.320]   I guess we can't trust the Bible.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.880]   We had one outlier.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.040]   I mean, that truly is it.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.880]   Let me give you another one.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.600]   And go research it for yourself.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   This is another one.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.520]   Comes from Mark chapter nine, verse 29.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.680]   And it's Jesus replying to his disciples who were like,
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.600]   "Hey, why couldn't we cast the demon out?"
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.360]   And he said, "This type, this kind
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.420]   "can only come out by prayer."
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.800]   And then we found a manuscript out of those thousands
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.040]   that said, "This kind can only come out by prayer
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.220]   "in fasting."
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.420]   So which one is it?
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.240]   I don't, probably not a bad idea to fast.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.680]   I don't know, but at the end of the day,
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.840]   it doesn't change anything significant.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.800]   And even that right there, look in your Bible,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.780]   it's footnoted.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.840]   Some say prayer and fasting at the bottom.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.080]   And if you're sitting there, you're like,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.580]   experiencing what I experienced sitting in class
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.880]   in grad school, going like, "All right, dude,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.760]   "all right, push those aside.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.680]   "Give me the hard one.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.520]   "I want the big one.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.580]   "I want the one that's like, you know,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.400]   "where's the one about Jesus being married?"
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   Being like, we've all heard that from the Da Vinci Code.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.120]   Doesn't exist.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.000]   Where's the one about, you know,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.240]   this one says Jesus died on a cross.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.680]   This one says he fell off a cliff.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.520]   Where's that one?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.560]   Where's the one that says,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   this one had Jesus had 12 disciples.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.440]   This one says he was a part of a biker gang.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440]   Where's that one?
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.880]   They don't exist.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.540]   All of the differences are as trivial as that.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.400]   And so the idea that, man, the Bible's been changed
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.760]   is candidly, intellectually lazy.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.320]   It has not been changed.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.040]   And you can not believe it for a lot of reasons.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.720]   Jesus believing that someone can rise from the dead,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.520]   that's a good enough reason if you can't get there.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.240]   But to say that like it's been changed is a smokescreen
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.360]   and candidly, you've either bought propaganda
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.120]   or you're being intellectually lazy.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.560]   Third reason, I'm sorry, the fourth reason
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   why Christians can believe and trust in the Bible
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.160]   is that it is proven historically reliable
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.680]   time and time again.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.080]   This is something else that's remarkable
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.920]   about the scriptures,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.840]   unlike any other religious book that's out there.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.600]   The Bible makes these predictions
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.680]   and then pulls them off over and over and over again.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.880]   In other words, there's these things called prophecies
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.080]   inside of the Old Testament
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.760]   where there's these prophecies that are given
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.500]   and they're hundreds of years
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.280]   before the event would take place
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.480]   and then the event takes place.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.000]   Some of the most common ones you probably have heard
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.400]   are around the life of Jesus,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.680]   where hundreds of years before Jesus was around,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.760]   there were 360 prophecies that he,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   one after one after one, fulfilled.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.960]   Some of them deal with things that you have no control over,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.600]   like where you're born.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.000]   Him being prophesied to be born in Bethlehem,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.660]   no one controls where they were born.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.440]   No one can be a part of that and yet it took place.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.960]   Other ones, even more remarkably,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.340]   deal with how he would die.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.680]   Why do I say even more remarkably?
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.040]   This comes from 1,000 years before Jesus was alive.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.940]   It comes from Psalm 22 where David writes
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.600]   about Jesus being crucified.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.300]   It says this, "A pack of villains encircles me,"
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.280]   speaking in a messianic way,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.480]   "They pierce my hands and my feet.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.960]   "All of my bones are on display.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.520]   "People stare at me and gloat.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.720]   "They divide my clothes among them
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.600]   "and cast lots for my garment."
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.560]   Reads almost identically to Matthew 27, verse 35.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.000]   It's 1,000 years before.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.800]   What else is even more remarkable?
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.360]   He speaks of crucifixion.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.880]   My arms are pierced and my feet are pierced.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.760]   This is 300 years before anyone had ever been crucified.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.200]   It was invented in the 700s.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   The predictions that contain,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.440]   inside of the Old Testament,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.040]   that one after one are remarkable.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.800]   Historically, the Bible has proven true
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.400]   over and over and over again.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.040]   Maybe you've read the words of Isaiah.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.600]   Isaiah, who wrote 700 plus years
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.360]   before the life of Jesus, would say this
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.000]   in Isaiah chapter 53.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   "Speaking of Jesus, he was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.220]   "He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.820]   "The punishment that brought us peace was upon him,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.300]   "and by his wounds we are healed."
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.500]   That entire passage points to Jesus.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.680]   Hundreds of years before Jesus was ever born.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.420]   There was a guy who was head of mathematics
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.420]   and at Pasadena College in California.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.780]   He was head of mathematics
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.420]   and another part of the sciences.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.940]   And he basically began to allow mathematics
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.180]   and include them into the conversation
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.100]   of what are the odds that someone would be able
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.240]   to complete eight of the Messianic prophecies
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.500]   that are there, eight of the Messianic predictions,
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.600]   let alone 360.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.500]   What he found, or his conclusion was,
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.180]   that for someone to complete eight of them
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.940]   would be the equivalent of having the chances
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.620]   of one in 10 to the 17th power,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.700]   or one in 100 children.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.540]   Children.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.260]   [laughing]
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.100]   Not children.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.540]   One in 100 trillion.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.080]   One in 100 trillion.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.540]   Which would be the equivalent
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.460]   of taking the state of Texas, he says,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.020]   filling it up about a foot and a half with quarters,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.620]   telling someone to walk as far as they want to
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.260]   into that sea of quarters,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.700]   having marked one and placing it in a random place,
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.540]   blindfolding them, telling them to walk as far
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.580]   in any direction as they want,
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.960]   allowed them to bend down and pick one
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.620]   out of that 100 trillion
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.460]   and the odds that they would pick it.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.180]   And he concludes it's an undeniable fact
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.860]   of the remarkable history and prophetic conclusions
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.440]   of the prophetic completions of Christ.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.540]   Not only that, you can even look outside of the Bible
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.220]   and see how things that were predicted in the Bible
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.060]   were even confirmed.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.980]   This is like, this is just super nerdy,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.780]   but let me just give you one and then we'll move on.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.740]   Just get this off my chest here.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   Who's heard of Alexander the Great?
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.780]   Dude, this is crazy.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.060]   Alexander the Great, he was a Greek essentially conqueror,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.020]   by like age 30, dude takes over the world.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.140]   And so we know Alexander went all over,
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.780]   he literally conquered the known world.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.020]   And he went very far east, he went very far west,
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.140]   he conquered the known world.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.260]   You know what's in the middle of the known world
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.100]   at that time?
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.460]   Jerusalem.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.340]   And everywhere that Alexander went,
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.460]   he would make people pay things,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.940]   a lot of times he would destroy villages,
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.220]   a lot of times he would destroy things.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.500]   You know what happened when Alexander the Great showed up
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.900]   in 332 to Jerusalem?
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.500]   The head or high priest of the city of Jerusalem
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.260]   went out to Alexander the Great
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.660]   and he showed him Daniel chapter eight.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   And he said, we knew you were coming.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   Daniel chapter eight speaks of how there would be
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.620]   a Greek conqueror who would come into the land
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.740]   and he would take over.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.660]   And he allowed Alexander the Great to read it
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.260]   and Alexander said, all right, have a good day,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.100]   we're good here.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.060]   And he allowed the city to stay intact.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.540]   Josephus talks about this inside of his writings.
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.860]   It's not just something that has been made up,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.660]   it's not something that's not anchored in history,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.240]   there is more evidence for the life of Jesus.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.820]   Outside of the Bible, then there is for the emperor
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.220]   that was around the same time that he was.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.620]   There are 42 references outside of the Bible,
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.740]   many by non-Christians.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.900]   There are 10 for the emperor Tiberius, think about that.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.260]   This isn't some like, oh, we made it up,
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.700]   it's not anchored in history, think about that.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.940]   That would be like there are 42 references
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.900]   within 150 years of President Trump or President Obama.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.660]   There's 42 references of some dude
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.060]   from like Maybank, Texas or Nowhereville.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.200]   And there's 42 references outside,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.020]   but there's 10 of President Trump or President Obama,
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.360]   the leader of the land, the ruler of the known world.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.980]   It is not something that, it is an undeniable,
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.760]   unmistakable reality of God's intervention into the world.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.640]   The Bible has been proven historically accurate
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.620]   over and over and over again.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.300]   There are reasons to not believe it,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.040]   if you can't get over the resurrection,
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.880]   but the historical reliability is not one of them.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.200]   Finally, the reason why Christians believe
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.280]   that the Bible is true is because of personal testimony.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   That's the fifth P.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.440]   Because those of us who put our faith in Jesus
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.300]   and we've begun to live by God's word,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.400]   we've experienced the transformation that comes
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.960]   by living according to what God's word says.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.160]   We've experienced it when it says,
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.320]   man, it's here to give you life,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.600]   it's here to lead you in the,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.800]   it's here to guide you,
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.520]   like a remote control with a helicopter, it's true.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.240]   In other words, we've experienced a life,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.440]   personally experienced a life of what it looks like
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.320]   to experience freedom from pornography addiction,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.680]   experience freedom from anger and bitterness,
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.900]   from past hurts, from family, divorce,
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.760]   from all the things in our past, personally for me,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.720]   to experience freedom and increasing peace
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.000]   in the midst of a world that feeds anxiety
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.080]   and can fill that anxiety that we've experienced,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.640]   that there is truth that contains here,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.480]   that no amount of evidence could convince otherwise
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.400]   because we've experienced it.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.120]   Fifth reason why Christians believe in the scriptures
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.720]   is because of our personal experience
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.000]   and personal testimony with it.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.400]   All over this room right now, there's men and women
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.040]   who by the thousands have experienced
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.000]   the transforming truths that contain in God's word.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.040]   They've experienced it in their own life.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.600]   I was talking with a friend, a new friend,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.560]   I just met tonight, earlier this evening,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.280]   and he was saying about how a year and a half ago,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.200]   we came, he trusted in Jesus, he trusted in Christ here,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.440]   he was depressed, he was addicted,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.240]   he was miserable and lonely, he said.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.400]   He trusted in Jesus, began to live by God's word
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.640]   and his life began to change.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.140]   It's happening all around you.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.920]   People don't come to the porch because we give opinions.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.440]   And if you do, the day we do, stop coming.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.900]   We try to just open God's word and say,
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.600]   man, he's preserved it throughout history for us.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.200]   He's a God who entered into human history for us,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   who displayed his love perfectly for us on a cross,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.320]   who preserved his teachings,
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   who gave us the strength to live in order to tell us
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.600]   and to guide us to life.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:45.040]   The personal testimony that we've experienced,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.800]   which may be the strongest, candidly, inside of the room.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.880]   Here's what I know.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.120]   If you're inside of the room, you're like, man,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.800]   I just don't know that the Bible is true.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.620]   Man, I would love to talk with you.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.880]   I'd love to speak with you.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.000]   Because usually, most of the time, it's a smoke screen.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.360]   Let's be honest.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   It's not like, oh, the Bible's been changed, is your deal.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.200]   It's not true.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.160]   And that's why you don't want the Bible.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.320]   That's candidly why most of the conversations with family
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.680]   over Thanksgiving where people are like,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.080]   you know, it's been changed,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.760]   is because they're afraid it may require them to change.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.040]   So they don't want it to be true.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.420]   Not because of some convincing teaching
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.960]   that provided that it was true.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:24.440]   In conclusion, the Bible declares, it is the word of God.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.580]   Its production and its preservation smacks of it.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.960]   It is anchored in history like no other work is,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.680]   and it is transforming the lives of everyone
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   who applies it and lives by it.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:43.480]   I took that helicopter back, and I'll close here.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.000]   And I took it, well, I didn't have the helicopter.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.160]   I had the remote.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.400]   And I took it back to the store,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.000]   and I explained what happened.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.680]   And I was like, this is all I got.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.280]   And they said, huh, man, that's bizarre.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.740]   And they gave me another one.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.200]   They were like, we'll give you a second one.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   I don't really know why they decided to do that.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.820]   Maybe just 'cause it's Walmart, and that's it.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.680]   But they gave it just a second chance.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.720]   If you're in the room,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.640]   and you've been kind of hiding on this cloud of like,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.060]   man, do I really trust the Bible?
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.360]   Can I really believe it?
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.200]   I'm just gonna keep living for myself.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.560]   This is God screaming at you.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.320]   This is your second chance.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.280]   He's not angry at you.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.860]   He's crazy about you.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.960]   And he wants to make sure that you know it.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.120]   He wants you to know it so badly, he died in your place.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.600]   He wants you to know his love for you so badly,
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.440]   he wrote it so that you would never have to wonder.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.840]   And he's anchored it in history.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.080]   And this is your second chance.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.160]   He's not here to rip you off.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.920]   He's here to lead you to life.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.360]   And you have been sold a lie.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.120]   If you think the God of the universe
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   is out there being like, I don't want anyone to have fun.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   You have been sold a lie.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.360]   He's a God who made you, who loves you, who died for you.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.080]   And he wants to allow anyone who will accept his son
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.240]   in his death and resurrection in your place
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.360]   to experience that new life.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.600]   And he wants to guide you to it through his word,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.280]   through his people, and through his spirit.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.120]   Let me pray.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.540]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:35.680]   Father, thank you for the amazing gift
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   of your scripture.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.440]   Father, I just confess for all the times
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   that I have not seen it as an amazing gift
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.120]   and I haven't taken advantage of it.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.520]   How many millions or billions of people
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.440]   throughout the ages would have given anything
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.640]   to have a Bible and they fill my home
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   and they fill my desk and they fill shelves.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.400]   Often unused.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.060]   Father, would you make us people who live by your word?
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.800]   Because we've encountered your son
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.420]   who all of the scripture and all of your word points to.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.640]   I pray for anyone in this room right now
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.780]   who's never had a moment where they trusted in Christ.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.920]   They never had a moment where they came to accept Jesus
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.160]   as their savior, that you would stretch out
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.800]   your hand right now.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.640]   You would move them past the excuses
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.280]   and move them past all the different reasons
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.980]   that they tell themselves about why they can't believe
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.900]   that it's true, and they would at least begin
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.060]   to seek answers.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.840]   Because there's a God who wants to know them.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.540]   And whether they realize it or not, they want to know.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.720]   Father, thank you that you have revealed yourself
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.740]   and you will lead us to life if we will let you.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.060]   We love you, amen.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:56.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
