[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.420]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.020]   Hey, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.860]   Check, check, check.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.120]   Welcome friends in Fort Worth,
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.600]   El Paso, Houston, Porch North,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.160]   Dallas is kicking off tonight in Frisco and Plano
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   at the Angelica Theater.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.920]   So welcome to you guys and everybody else
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.160]   tuning in from around the country.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.280]   I was flying back from Atlanta yesterday
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.140]   and got food poisoning, which was awesome.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.740]   So today in the last 24 hours have been interesting.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.360]   So if tonight seems interesting, there you go.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.080]   And hey, we're continuing this series, Instagram Theology,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.040]   where we are looking at some of the cultural mantras
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.140]   and questioning how they align with biblical truth.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.080]   And one of the things that I love about social media
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   is oftentimes it gives a voice or it gives a perspective
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000]   or it just showcases just different things in culture
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.200]   that create a unique rise among people.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.560]   Recently, if you've been following on Twitter
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.240]   or you've been following on Instagram, mainly Twitter,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.880]   there has been a debate taking place or a war,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.200]   some have called it, about the chicken sandwich.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.040]   What is the best chicken sandwich?
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.840]   Is it Chick-fil-A?
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.520]   Is it Popeyes?
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.880]   Who has had a Popeyes chicken sandwich in here?
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.440]   They're sold out, dude.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.400]   The most genius marketing ploy of all time.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.140]   They're sold out.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.400]   But there's just been a back and forth
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.560]   that a lot of hilarious things have come out of that
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.880]   and different memes and different people raising their voice
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.120]   and raising the perspective on like,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.920]   hey, this is the best chicken sandwich of all time.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.520]   And it just kind of like exploded
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.720]   and people putting forward, you know,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.360]   Chick-fil-A versus Popeyes
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.000]   and then Wendy's tries to throw something in there
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.080]   just to get a little air time
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.600]   and everyone's like, all right, we're done with you.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000]   And back to Chick-fil-A and Popeyes
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.080]   and just people going off about, you know,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.240]   hey, this is what I think is best.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.080]   No, this is what is best.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   No, this is what's best.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.200]   Hey, you haven't even tried it yet.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.560]   You don't have a chance
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000]   or you don't have the right to even speak into this.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.600]   This is for sure the best chicken sandwich
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.440]   that is out there.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.840]   Or really, you know, if you take the Popeyes
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.860]   and you add the Chick-fil-A sauce,
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.800]   that's the best scenario that you can have, really.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.660]   And people just going off about their opinion
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.280]   and expressing it in social media
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.560]   gives us really a chance to kind of voice
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.960]   what we think is true or our opinion
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.400]   about a certain situation.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.760]   And this was another recent scenario
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.600]   in the last couple of weeks
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.160]   where that happened with the sandwich.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.960]   Not dissimilar to a time about a year ago
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   where there was another moment in our culture
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.580]   or on social media where another thing came up
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.420]   that sharply divided people around what is actually true
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.980]   and what is their perspective on this thing was.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.440]   What I mean, it was something that had to do
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.480]   with an audio tape or audio recording.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.240]   Oh man, you guys know it.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080]   And this is the audio recording.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   I think, Billy, you have it.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   (imitating chicken clucking)
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   And in the room right now,
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.880]   you are either hearing Laurel or Yanny.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   By show of hands, all right, that's enough.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   It's a little creepy, more creepy than I thought it would be.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.200]   By show of hands, who hears Laurel in this room?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.760]   Oh wow.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.360]   Okay, who hears Yanny?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   Wow, wait a second, one more time.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.680]   Hold on, hold on.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.120]   Laurel, raise 'em high, raise 'em praise.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.320]   Okay, I hear Laurel.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.560]   Who hears Yanny?
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.880]   Okay, the math doesn't add up.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.960]   Some of you guys are raising your hands twice here.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.440]   It was another one of those moments where in culture,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   everyone was like, hey, you guys are crazy
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.960]   to think that it's Yanny,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.400]   or you're crazy to think that it's Laurel.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.320]   I'm not even gonna bring up
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.640]   the black and blue dress gate of 2015.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   We're over that one.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.480]   But social media has really given us a chance
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.040]   to kind of divide and take sides and express our opinion
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.320]   and express what we think it is
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.720]   and express our perspective on the matter
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   or our opinion on it.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.600]   And the reason I start there is 'cause tonight,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.000]   we're gonna talk about another subject
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   or really something that goes along those lines
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.120]   that is a cultural mantra that takes place
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.160]   often in social media,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.680]   but really even more broadly in society,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.880]   that further encourages,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.920]   you have an opinion and you have an perspective
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.840]   and you need to share that perspective,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.200]   but it doesn't call it your perspective.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.920]   It calls it share your truth.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.960]   There's a cultural mantra that you and I
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.800]   should be encouraged to go speak your truth,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.600]   that you have a truth, you have a story,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.680]   you need to speak it.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.320]   It was popularized by Oprah in 2013 at an award ceremony
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   where she just said that the most important thing
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   or the most powerful thing that you can do
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.240]   is to speak your truth.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.320]   Other variations of it can look like people saying things
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.880]   like, man, I've just been trying to live my truth lately.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.200]   Or saying in the midst of a conversation
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.480]   where maybe you disagree with somebody,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.280]   they're like, hey dude, that works for you.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.360]   We disagree, your truth is your truth, my truth is mine.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.840]   It's really another variation of the you do you
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   or do whatever makes you happy.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000]   No longer is there just kind of a source
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.760]   or singular truth, but what is true
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.160]   could be just true for you.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.520]   Now the consequences of this scenario with Laurel and Yanny,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   the chicken sandwich is really just kind of
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.440]   a matter of opinion, but when it comes to Laurel and Yanny,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.920]   it's a matter of your perspective.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.560]   And there are times where my perspective,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.680]   I could believe it's true,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.700]   but it's not necessarily the truth.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.820]   There is a truth to it, whether it's Laurel or Yanny.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.320]   But the consequences of believing wrongly
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.420]   or having the wrong perspective
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.520]   or believing the wrong truth about that thing
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.840]   are pretty minimal, other than it may
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.160]   make for an interesting conversation
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.960]   with your coworkers or with friends after tonight.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.680]   But the consequences for believing
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.920]   a perspective that's not true about marriage,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.560]   about God, about you,
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.680]   about the type of job you should work,
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.440]   about the type of relationships you should have,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.320]   about what life is about, are much more significant.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   And we as a society have never been in more need of truth
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.560]   not a generic high-level kind of like speaker truth
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.960]   and this moving target and what's true for me
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.000]   may not be true for you, but an actual truth.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.480]   And every way that you look,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.720]   our society seems to be kind of embracing this idea
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.540]   that whatever you feel like, that is your truth.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.400]   And whenever a person, a people, a country, or society
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.100]   begins to believe that idea,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.760]   there are significant consequences.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.280]   And the Bible, here's what's crazy,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.560]   God speaks to this exact idea about why,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   hey, speak your truth as subtle as it be,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.120]   'cause I think most of us just mean like,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   mm, yes, Popeye's chicken sandwich,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.440]   mm, girl, speak your truth.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.880]   We mean it in a subtle way,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.560]   but it can be even a dangerous thing
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.140]   if we begin to think that truth is kind of a moving target
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.600]   and it's not a one-size-fits-all,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.340]   it's kind of just whatever you deem as truth.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.360]   They should just say, man, mm, speak your opinion.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.760]   And so we're gonna look tonight at some of the ideas
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.540]   and how you and I can begin to recognize,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.040]   hey, what am I believing right now that may not be true?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.180]   What is my perspective, and I truly feel it in this moment,
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.560]   but how can I know when something is actually true?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   And what should I do with my perspective
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   when it doesn't align with reality or the truth?
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   And how do I even determine kind of what's reality
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.680]   if I really do feel in this moment I'm hearing Yanny
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.360]   and it's Laurel, or I'm hearing Laurel
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.640]   and it's actually Yanny?
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   And so we're gonna look at just this idea
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.000]   and dive into what God's word has to say about truth,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.840]   'cause here's the deal.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.560]   At the moment that society began to put forward
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.240]   something that says truth, it's like they stepped
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.680]   and we all stepped into God's playpen,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480]   because God says truth is not something you define,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.840]   I define it.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.120]   And so we're gonna look at what the Bible says
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.760]   about this idea of truth and significant consequences
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.580]   for any people who do not embrace the reality of truth.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.740]   So three ideas, three ways that you can recognize.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.020]   Here's the danger with all these different
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.280]   social media mantras,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.920]   is there's some partial truth to each of 'em.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.940]   There's like some partial truth to speak your truth.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.280]   It's, another way of saying it,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.600]   is there is some partial truth to the idea of,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.460]   hey, you should share your perspective,
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.100]   your opinion at times, your story.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.280]   The danger in all the different things
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.160]   we're gonna look at for the next few weeks
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.180]   is that they're not these huge, big, distorted lies.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's like they're just, they take a truth
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.040]   and then they just twist it a little bit.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.600]   In other words, what makes a counterfeit
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.120]   more easily able to deceive someone
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.440]   is how closely it resembles the thing it's trying to fake
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.280]   or be a counterfeit of.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.160]   Like in other words, I don't know if you guys
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.960]   have seen fake Louis Vuitton purses.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.480]   If you like go to New York on that one street,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.680]   whatever street that is called,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.600]   you're able to like buy a version of Louis Vuitton purses.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.620]   Like here's two real ones and a fake one
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.880]   right next to each other.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.100]   Just imagine with me, if you will,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.100]   two real ones and a fake one right next to each other.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.760]   No, they don't have 'em?
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.600]   Okay, we're just gonna keep imagining that they're there.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.440]   And if you look at it, what I was gonna pull up
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.680]   is two pictures, maybe they'll pull up here in a second,
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   of just like here's these two Louis Vuitton purses
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.420]   and they're strikingly similar.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.560]   And if you're a girl, you may be able to like notice
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.840]   you know, all the different intricacies.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.960]   If you looked really hard, but as a guy,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   And then there was also one of a regular purse
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.520]   that someone had just taken a Sharpie
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.200]   and written Louis Vuitton on the outside.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.840]   And I'm not the smartest guy, but even I can go,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.900]   I don't know that that was like what Louis was going for
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.960]   or that is an actual Louis Vuitton.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.800]   And so what makes a counterfeit dangerous
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.720]   is just it's closer to the truth
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.780]   and then subtly twisted.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.480]   So we're gonna look at another one of these truths
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   or semi-truths that's just taken truth and twisted it
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.360]   and look at three ways that you and I can recognize,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.600]   begin to recognize, hey, where am I believing a lie?
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.840]   Where's my perspective off?
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.320]   And what is actually the truth and how can I live by it?
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   So the first idea, the first thing to recognize
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   is recognize that your perspective may or may not be true.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.420]   The problem with speak your truth is it suggests
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.240]   that your perspective or what you feel is always the truth.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.700]   Now you may truly feel something,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.820]   but that doesn't mean that it's true.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.300]   In other words, your perspective at times,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.940]   it may be true or it may not be true,
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.800]   but knowing, hey, in every situation,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.820]   I need to come at this humbly knowing that my perspective
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.060]   on what's going on here,
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.420]   on what my coworkers think about me,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.920]   on what the person I'm dating thinks about me
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.780]   or how this is going, about why they didn't invite me
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.300]   to hang out with those people,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.760]   it may be truth or it may not be true.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.540]   And so approaching it with a cautiousness,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.260]   recognizing that your perspective or your feelings
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.700]   are not always an accurate indicator of reality.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.660]   I wrote in my notes that what you feel is not always real.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.740]   It may be really what you feel
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.020]   and you should be honest about that
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.860]   and you shouldn't hide it
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.960]   and pretend like you're not feeling that,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.900]   but you should also recognize that what you feel
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.300]   may not be an accurate depictor of reality.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.020]   Your perspective is not always an accurate one.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.760]   It's very simple on the head,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.140]   but it has significant consequences
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.700]   and it completely contradicts the idea
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.140]   of speaking your truth.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.280]   It's not dissimilar to really like Instagram in general,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.260]   as we've talked about in this whole series.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.620]   Instagram is kind of a perfect example
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.620]   of where my perspective is definitely not reality.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.820]   And the more that I get on Instagram
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.100]   and I look at people's Insta stories
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.940]   or I look at their account
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.720]   and the things that they're posting,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.900]   and I believe that that's actually real life,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.420]   the more I'm gonna have a distorted view
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.260]   of kind of everyone else's life but my own.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.100]   You think about this?
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.060]   Like when I get on Instagram,
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.300]   all the pictures that people post,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.700]   and you do it too and I do it too,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.260]   where they're like pictures of people
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.460]   and they're riding around bikes with baskets on the front
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.380]   that are from the '70s
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.900]   and they're getting cupcakes together.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.380]   They're always on vacation,
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.480]   always swimming in the pool, somewhere warmer.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.420]   Their life is together.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.060]   It's like, do these people even work?
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.880]   No, they don't have to work.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.680]   They got money growing on trees in their backyard.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.520]   That's what they do.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.380]   They drive in the right car.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.220]   They have the best clothes.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.220]   They look amazing.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.260]   And here's the kicker.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.780]   They're always smiling.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.540]   And then you get to be around them.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.140]   And here's the weird thing about ministry.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.580]   It's like you kind of rub elbows
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.080]   with a bunch of different people at different times.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.740]   And you get to know 'em.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.620]   And it's like their life is falling apart.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.600]   Their marriage is falling apart.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400]   They're struggling with depression and antidepressants.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.460]   They're like in this place
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.140]   where it's so, so much pain.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.580]   And yet if you just went off of what you saw,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.340]   you would have to come to the conclusion
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.700]   your perspective is not reality.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.360]   Instagram is not real.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.020]   And in the same way, your perspective is not always real.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.380]   The things that you're feeling
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.360]   are not always an accurate depiction.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.840]   The biggest problem with speak your truth
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.080]   is it suggests truth could be different
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.180]   from person to person,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.500]   which by definition contradicts what truth is.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.320]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   Like the definition of truth.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.440]   Like here's the definition from dictionary.com.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.020]   I think they have this slide.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.880]   If not, I'm gonna be flying blind here.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.780]   Boom, they've got it.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.500]   Okay, no Louis Vuitton, but we do have dictionary.com.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.660]   All the different definitions of truth
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.500]   if you were to type it in.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.240]   So hey, do you have the true actual state of matter?
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.140]   Conformity with fact or reality?
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.420]   A verified or indisputable fact?
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.100]   Proposition principle, I'm not even gonna read all of them.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.940]   But here's what you'll notice all of them have in common.
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.340]   None of them suggest that truth is something
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.340]   that you can change or that you can tweak
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.920]   and that you can make kind of whatever best suits you
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.540]   and you do you or whatever best suits your scenario
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.580]   and your situation right there.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.380]   Like truth is fixed.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.220]   And by definition, the reason speak your truth falls apart
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.180]   is you cannot have a truth that is just unique to you
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.960]   and not universally true.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.020]   Because truth by definition is something
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.660]   that is in line with reality.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.620]   But we on an individual level all the time try to escape
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.180]   and try to live as though there isn't like fixed truth
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.020]   and I can kind of live whatever's true for me
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.820]   both as an individual, we do this and really as a society,
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.420]   we are so confused.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.580]   As an individual, what I mean?
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.460]   I mean people who are like, hey, you know what?
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.660]   I know the Bible doesn't exactly encourage living together
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.520]   but me and my girl, we're moving in, it's cheaper rent.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.260]   I just think it's the best move for us.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.360]   We need to get to know each other
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.580]   before we move further in this relationship.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   Find out if we're compatible
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.820]   so we're gonna move in together,
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.380]   begin to spend time forming that relationship
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.180]   before we get too serious.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.880]   That's what I think is best for us.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.900]   That's kind of like the truth
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.660]   that I think we should follow and live by.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.060]   That's an example of somebody living their truth
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.160]   or living according to their perspective and their feelings.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.600]   Another example would be couples who are like,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.900]   you know, sex before marriage,
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.140]   I guess the Bible is not real big on that
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.580]   but I think that if we're gonna get married,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.280]   we need to find out if we're sexually compatible
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.540]   or we're married in God's eyes
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.980]   and we're gonna get married eventually
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.500]   so we should move towards that direction.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.300]   Culture says, wait till you're ready
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.860]   and I feel like I was born ready so let's do this.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.860]   And that's somebody speaking their truth.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.700]   Another example would be,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.700]   and this is a really common one among young adults,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.100]   and that was the idea that,
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.620]   hey, I know I'm supposed to get plugged into a church
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.420]   but every church is messed up
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.700]   and me and Jesus are cool
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.900]   and you can't tell me that I can't be cool with Jesus
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.140]   if I'm not a member of a church somewhere
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.060]   and so I'm gonna do me,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.180]   that's what I think is best for me in this situation
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.140]   and you're living your truth.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.380]   You wouldn't say it that way
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   but that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.080]   You're doing what seems right to you in that scenario.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.980]   Tragically as a society, in a way that is shocking,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.200]   we're doing this like more than ever
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.140]   where we've begun to embrace and go full tilt,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.440]   do whatever you feel.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.540]   Whatever you feel is right, that's what you should do.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.780]   There isn't really a right and wrong,
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.180]   like whatever you feel is your reality and is your truth.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.460]   What do I mean?
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.180]   Think about things like gender.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.500]   In looking this week at Facebook,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.180]   do you know how many genders you can suggest
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.380]   and select on Facebook?
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.340]   58.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.220]   Yeah, I think they have a list of these.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.140]   There they are.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.020]   Two for three, guys, here we go.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.420]   58 different genders.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.300]   Agender, we're gonna go through each one of these
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.380]   and 'cause they're just saying,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.060]   "Hey, gender's kind of a moving target.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.820]   "We don't want anyone to feel left out
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.660]   "and so just in case we missed you,
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.420]   "we're gonna put other at the very last."
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.020]   Sometimes I think about trying to explain to someone
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:42.020]   like 10 years ago, this and how confused they would be
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:48.300]   and sometimes I think in 100 years,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.380]   they're gonna be so confused
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.820]   on what was wrong with these people.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.500]   But as a society, we are thinking,
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.020]   and I'm not pointing that out to be judgmental
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.780]   or do anything or condemning
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.340]   because the Bible would say there are only two genders.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.860]   My point in pointing all of that out is as a society,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.140]   you cannot argue the fact that we have wholesale bought
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.140]   the idea of hey, you do you.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.020]   Whatever you define as your truth, that's your truth.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.180]   We've done the same thing as it relates to when life begins.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.020]   There's so many examples, but here's another one
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.820]   is the idea that when life begins,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.420]   it's really up to you.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.140]   That a child is not a child
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.420]   unless the mother feels like it is a child.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.500]   Last year, the House of Representatives
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.620]   in the United States Congress passed a bill
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.780]   that a child in the womb is not a child
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.980]   until the point of birth.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.500]   A girl on our team is 34 weeks pregnant.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.380]   Look up a 34-week-old ultrasound.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.660]   It's shocking.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.700]   All of his organs are developed.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.100]   Every eyelid is there, his fingerprints,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.940]   there's on everything,
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.740]   and that happens much early in the scenario.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.660]   But our culture has said that unless the wife,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.980]   or the wife, unless the mother feels like it is a baby,
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.260]   it is not a baby, and she can make the decision
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.180]   to end the life inside of her at any point
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.620]   because we as a culture have said that feelings trump all.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.780]   We have, instead of making our lives pursue the heart of God,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.540]   we have made the heart a God.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.220]   And it is gonna have,
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.500]   it's already having tremendous consequences.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.460]   And the God who's there is saying,
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.020]   "I do not want you to live with the perspective
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.340]   "that everything you feel is reality.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.540]   "And if you follow your heart,
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.300]   "it's gonna lead you to bad and deadly places,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.900]   "both for a culture, a country who does that,
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.340]   "and for an individual who allows that to happen
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.700]   "inside of their own life."
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.500]   Proverbs chapter 14 says, and speaks to this exact idea,
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.020]   that there is a way, verse 12 of Proverbs chapter 14,
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.220]   there's a way that seems to appear to be right,
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.540]   but in the end leads to death.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.780]   How brilliant was Solomon?
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.020]   Like this verse right here,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.140]   if you guys haven't been to church for a while,
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.540]   or maybe this is your first time back in a while,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.740]   either way, this is probably some of the oldest literature
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.500]   you've ever written, or ever read before.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.340]   In other words, if you read like Homer,
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.540]   or Plato, or any of that stuff,
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.180]   this far is older than that,
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.900]   hundreds of years older than that.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.260]   And even hundreds of years ago, Solomon,
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.180]   sitting down, one of the wisest people who ever lived,
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.460]   or wisest person other than Jesus, who ever lived,
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.620]   wrote that there is a way, as he observed society,
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.660]   that people think like, "Oh yeah, this is a good idea.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.500]   "Oh yeah, we should do this.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.460]   "Yeah, this is a great idea."
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.860]   And it leads to death and destruction inside of their life.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.580]   We see this in so many different arenas,
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.180]   so many different relationships where people are like,
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.060]   "Yeah, I know, he's not exactly a Christian,
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.340]   "but I love him, and I just feel like
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.380]   "I could be a good influence on his life."
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.740]   And it leads to heartbreak.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.780]   People take substances and get addicted,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.220]   and are trapped inside of just a bondage to a substance,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.660]   and they do so by their own choosing.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.660]   Think about that, just like the self-destructiveness.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.500]   There's something in all of us that's broken.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.340]   And Solomon says, "If you begin to follow your heart,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.060]   "it's gonna take you in a direction
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.500]   "that always ends in pain for you,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.060]   "and pain for anyone who's a part of that."
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.740]   The reason why is because the Bible says,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.260]   in Jeremiah chapter 17, verse nine,
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.620]   the reason why there's something inside of you
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.820]   that seems like, "Yes, this is right,"
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.180]   and you're walking off a cliff,
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.140]   is because you have a heart that is utterly sick.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.820]   Jeremiah chapter 17, verse nine says this,
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:21.740]   "The heart is deceitful above everything else,
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.860]   "or above all things, and beyond cure."
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.900]   Think about that.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.620]   The Bible says that your heart,
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.100]   have you ever met somebody who's really good at lying?
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.940]   And we've all met people who are really bad at lying.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.180]   We're like, "Yeah, I know you're not telling the truth,
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.140]   "so I can tell it's written all over your face."
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.540]   The Bible says that the heart,
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.940]   it's like world-class at lying to you.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.060]   It'll deceive you.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.900]   You won't even realize that you're being deceived
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.300]   in a moment, because the heart, this thing inside of you,
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   has been fractured by sin, and it's utterly sick.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.340]   It says, "Beyond cure, who can understand?"
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.180]   The danger of when you make the heart your God,
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.180]   or what you feel be the determining factor
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.620]   about what you do, is that you and I have sick hearts,
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.620]   and God has invited us to surrender our life,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.140]   to surrender to his spirit, and allow him to walk with us,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.260]   to begin to restore and direct our life.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.300]   But if you just allow your heart
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.380]   to be the direction of your life,
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.660]   you are not gonna head in a direction
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.860]   that you want to end up.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.780]   So the first idea is that we're told
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.620]   that if you follow what your perspective,
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.820]   what you think is real, it will always end up costing you,
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.620]   that your feelings are real, they're not always reliable,
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.660]   and they're not always determining of what is real.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.740]   Not long ago, I got to, I guess it was a while ago now,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.700]   but once upon a time, I got to go in a private jet
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.980]   with a friend of mine.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.060]   And anyone ever been on a private jet before?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.420]   Yeah, this is not a circle that I'd run in very often.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.140]   So I was like, "Dude, this is amazing."
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.620]   And so got to go sit on this private jet,
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.820]   he was flying to St. Louis for something related to work,
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.380]   and he was like, "Yeah, you wanna come with me?"
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.940]   And got in there, and it was all amazing,
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.820]   leather chairs, you're like, "This is incredible."
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.140]   And I start talking to the pilot,
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.580]   'cause I'm just fascinated by the whole situation.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.220]   And the pilot, I'm asking him about flying,
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.380]   and how fast does this thing go, and yada, yada, yada.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.660]   At some point, he's like, "You wanna come up here?"
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.140]   I'm like, "I thought you'd never ask."
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.020]   Okay, so I get in the cockpit,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.220]   and he lets me sit in the cockpit
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.500]   as we're like taking off and flying.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.540]   And what happened when we took off and got into the air
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.420]   was so shocking to me, and terrifying, honestly.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.380]   Because we got into the clouds, and we couldn't see anything.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.340]   I don't know what I was expecting,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.180]   but I guess I was thinking like,
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.140]   "Man, you're gonna go up into the air,
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.180]   "and you can like see the horizon, this is beautiful.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.420]   "Oh, hey guys."
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.260]   And I'd be able to see kind of things that are out there,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.220]   you couldn't see anything.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.100]   It was like someone who just put a giant fog machine
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.020]   in front of the plane and was just blowing smoke.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   You'd just see the clouds in front of you.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.580]   And as we began to talk, it was like,
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.660]   "How do you know where you're going?
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.860]   "How do you make sure that you're not like flying
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.140]   "into another plane that's coming?"
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.220]   It was kind of terrifying.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.520]   And he said, "This is honestly what it's like all the time.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.240]   "The way that you know is you trust the instruments.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.100]   "You can't go based on what you see,
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.380]   "or even what you feel, because it'll lead you astray."
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.720]   Like, "Do you know, this is a crazy thing.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.300]   "Do you know that there's something called
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.700]   "black hole vertigo?"
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.780]   And it basically is a scenario,
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.020]   and this happens if you ever meet a pilot,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.860]   or you know someone who's a pilot,
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.700]   you could ask them about it,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.580]   where basically you will feel like you are traveling
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.900]   in one direction, because all of your senses,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.960]   when they get up in the air, vertigo clicks in,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.840]   black hole vertigo, and it begins to trick you,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.580]   and it makes you think that you're headed in a direction
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.940]   you're not really headed in.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.700]   That's how JFK Jr., if you remember JFK Jr.,
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.100]   that's how he died, is he thought he was flying straight,
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.720]   and he ended up flying right into the ocean.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.140]   That it'll trick your senses to being like,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.580]   "Oh yeah, we're fine," and you're upside down.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.540]   That you can't tell, you're totally disoriented.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.780]   It messes with your senses.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.260]   So if you go based on what you feel,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.820]   you will disrupt, or you're putting your life
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.300]   in an incredible risk, and incredible chaos
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.500]   is likely to happen.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.700]   Or you go based on what the instruments,
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.660]   and the levels, and all the different machines
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.940]   that are part of a jet plane tell you to do.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.080]   They tell you, even when I feel like,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.580]   "Oh man, we're headed upside down,"
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.060]   they'll tell you when it's level.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.300]   Even when I feel like, "Man, we're not headed
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.220]   "the right direction," it tells you exactly
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.100]   the direction that you're going in,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.680]   that you have to trust not what you feel,
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.020]   but the instruments.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.340]   As a Christian, the Bible tells us
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.380]   that we are to take all of the things that we feel,
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.100]   and try to align them with God's word.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.540]   Don't trust the things that you feel,
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.700]   if they don't align with God's word.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.020]   Don't trust them if they don't align
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.780]   with the instrument that is the Bible.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.980]   Which brings us to the second idea,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.540]   the second thing to recognize,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.220]   as it relates to this idea of truth,
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.620]   which is that God's word is truth.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.560]   Recognize that God's word, that means the Bible, is truth.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.940]   Anytime my feelings, my perspective,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.740]   my opinion doesn't align with God's word,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.380]   or contradicts God's word,
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.820]   I either submit to his word, and to his authority,
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.100]   or to my own opinion, and make myself, really,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.220]   the source of truth, of what I think is right and wrong.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.420]   And in doing so, I forfeit what God said
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.500]   is the blessing of the life that he wants to lead me to.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.180]   In Proverbs chapter three, verse three through five,
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.100]   it says this, "Trust in the Lord with all of your heart.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.800]   "Do not trust your heart as Lord.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.500]   "Trust the Lord with your heart,
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.420]   "with everything that you feel."
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.580]   That's what that means.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.080]   "And do not lean on your own understanding,
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.800]   "on what you think is right,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.020]   "on how you think you should date,
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.120]   "how you think you should handle money,
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.540]   "when you think you should leave a job,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.620]   "on how you should talk about people."
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.460]   Whatever seems right to you,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.980]   you say, "I wouldn't lean on that."
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.140]   Lean and trust in the Lord, and trust in his word,
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.540]   with all of your heart, and all of your understanding.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.820]   Submit those to God.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.200]   In all of your ways, submit to him,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.780]   and he will make straight your paths.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.220]   He'll lead you to a life that doesn't look dysfunctional,
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.900]   and broken, and so messed up,
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.420]   but is a life that's full of healthy relationships,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.900]   full of a relationship that is connected to your creator,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.680]   a life full of purpose, and freedom.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.280]   That's what that means.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.140]   That you and I are to recognize God's word is truth,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.500]   that I am told that I am to trust
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.780]   the truth of God's revelation in every single situation.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.400]   I trust the truth of God's revelation,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.020]   that's what the Bible is, in every single situation.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.500]   Whatever is going on in my life,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.260]   that I'm to go, "Man, what would God's word say
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.700]   "about this situation right now?"
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.260]   If I'm insecure about what my boss thinks about me,
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.620]   what would God's word say about that?
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.060]   Well, it would say that, man,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.160]   the heart of kings are those in leadership,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.580]   and the things that they think,
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.460]   it's like water in the hands of the Lord.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.580]   He turns them wherever he wants.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.220]   God, you're in control over what the people above me
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.980]   in my workplace, what they think about me,
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.720]   what their opinions are of me.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.860]   The best thing I can do is surrender and to trust in you.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.400]   I'm not gonna be anxious and insecure
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.380]   and worried about that.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.060]   My singleness, my concern over whether or not
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.620]   I'm gonna get married, God, I'm gonna look to you
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.380]   and I'm gonna surrender and trust in you.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.940]   You have a plan for my life.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.540]   If you want me to be married,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.740]   I don't need to try to maneuver and try to manipulate
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.660]   and get on 75 dating apps and make it all work for myself.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.860]   I can trust you.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.540]   That in your timing, I'm just gonna continue to say,
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.440]   what does God's word say?
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.620]   And I'm gonna look for the type of person in God's word
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.860]   that you tell me I should date,
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.740]   I should be in relationship with, that I can trust you.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.780]   I'm gonna recognize that your word is truth in my life.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.340]   Jesus, in one of his final prayers for his boys,
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.380]   the disciples, in John chapter 17,
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.500]   was praying to his heavenly father for his 12 men.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.420]   And he said this.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   Father, would you make them holy by your truth?
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.020]   Teach them your word, which is truth.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   God's word is the truth and living by it leads to life.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:40.220]   Following Jesus and living according to God's word
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.900]   will make you better at life and will make your life better.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.820]   It's not gonna enrich like we talked about last week.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.140]   This isn't the prosperity gospel,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   but it promises that, hey, when you begin to date,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.420]   think, live, operate, follow the instructions
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.780]   in God's word, it will make your life better
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.700]   and it will make you better at life.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.900]   And he has called us to not just have this thing
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.980]   that we read every now and then or read even in the mornings
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.540]   but to read and to begin to apply it to our life,
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.660]   to take what is the principles that God left here for me
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.740]   to apply to my life.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:17.660]   I think the problem is when we read the Bible,
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.380]   when we read the Bible, it's honestly so confusing.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   I mean, can I get an amen?
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.220]   There's times you pick it up and you're like,
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.100]   "What is he saying right here?
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.780]   "These prophets are cuckoo for go-go buffs
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.700]   "and I don't know what they're saying."
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.540]   And a lot of that is because of the context
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.940]   that you're not reading it with,
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.420]   that you're not understanding exactly what's going on.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.260]   The goal, if you're gonna be a student of God's word,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.580]   'cause in order to apply God's word,
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.860]   you gotta know God's word.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.860]   And the challenge when a lot of us go to know
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.100]   or to read God's word, it's like,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.860]   man, this thing is so confusing.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.700]   And people will say things like,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.620]   "You know, the Bible, it's the roadmap to life."
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.460]   And then you're like, "All right,
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.580]   "well, I gotta pull this thing out
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.860]   "and looking for directions on should I marry her or not?
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.860]   "And okay, here is Kali, the one for me.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.900]   "Huh, men give gifts to all prostitutes,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.580]   "but you gave gifts to all your lovers,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.700]   "bribing them to come from every side with your whorings.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.540]   "What in the world?
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.060]   "God, are you trying to tell me something right now?
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.780]   "Is this an alarm bell that you're letting me know?
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.900]   "We just kind of flip open like it's a magic eight ball
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.740]   "or we're going to work."
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.740]   And we're like, "Man, is God want me to stay in this job
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.580]   "or does he not?
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.660]   "I don't really know what we have me do.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.500]   "Okay, let's just flip.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.620]   "Okay, this is a good one.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.980]   "All right, 44, two, okay.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.080]   "And the Lord said to me, this gate shall remain shut.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.100]   "It shall not be opened and no one shall enter by it.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.660]   "The Lord, your God of Israel has entered by."
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.780]   I'm so confused right now.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.740]   All right, I'll try again tomorrow.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.580]   And that's what we do.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.380]   We look at it like a magic eight ball
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.060]   where we're like, "I'm just gonna kind of flip open
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.620]   "and does he want me to be in this relationship?
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.700]   "I guess not."
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.740]   And, or yes, he does.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.300]   And we're looking for this kind of magical sign
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.460]   and we treat it like a magic eight ball.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.980]   And the Bible says that you and I are the people
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.680]   who rightly handle God's word, who study it, who know it.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.300]   And we, man, I'm so passionate
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.380]   and our team is so passionate.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.660]   We want you to be people
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.620]   who don't have to come to the porch.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.740]   You don't have to hear from anybody.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.120]   There's nothing special about myself
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.660]   or any of our team other than we just look at God's word
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.540]   and try to read what was it saying then?
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.380]   What's it saying now?
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.300]   What's kind of the eternal principle and truth
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.220]   that's inside of here?
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.260]   'Cause all of the different truths
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.940]   that are contained in God's word
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.120]   have principles and things that are relevant to your life.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.620]   It is more relevant to every situation
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.020]   on who you should date, how to handle money,
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.840]   the types of relationships and friendships you should have,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.100]   how you should speak.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.060]   I mean, it goes in so many different arenas
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.140]   that are relevant to your life.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.720]   But in order for you to begin to apply it,
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.020]   you've got to read it and you've got to be a student of it
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.200]   and begin to understand it.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.640]   So for that to happen, some of you,
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.480]   here's what you need to do.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.360]   I want you to take out your phone
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   and write down watermark.org/dallas/ministries/equippeddisciple.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.080]   Actually, just go to watermark.org,
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.640]   type in equipped disciple, equipped disciple.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.680]   It's a class that we offer here
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.480]   to help you understand how to know to read your Bible.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.360]   So you don't just read it and go,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.560]   "What in the world is happening right here?"
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.340]   Another opportunity that you can go to is,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.420]   we have Views from the Porch,
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.180]   which is an alternative podcast that we do.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.460]   It's a podcast that we did specifically,
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.780]   or one of them we did specifically,
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.620]   was on how to have quality time with a creator.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.120]   You can go read about how to have quality time
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.320]   with your creator.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.300]   If you don't have a Bible,
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.380]   there are Bibles that are for free
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.100]   in the Dallas location in the Welcome Center,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.960]   right outside of these doors.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.900]   You can grab one tonight.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.560]   That's our gift to you for free.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.420]   Another thing that you could consider doing
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.700]   is getting a good study Bible.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.460]   We actually have one here that we sell at cost.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.820]   I think we actually sell below cost.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.900]   It's an ESV study Bible.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.300]   It is a tremendous resource.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.700]   It is better than going to seminary.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.020]   And I say that as somebody going to seminary,
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.940]   who's went to seminary,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.340]   that if you read through this entire thing,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.040]   you will be as equipped as you could be
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.700]   if you went to seminary.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.620]   But either way, finding a good study Bible
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.440]   that just contains, like,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.540]   "Man, this helps me understand what was going on,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.940]   "so I don't have this kind of generic,
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.900]   "just rip these verses and words out of context."
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:04.740]   And you just go,
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.220]   "Man, I guess that's what God wants me to do
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.060]   "with a prostitute.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.020]   "Is she a prostitute?
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.140]   "Is that what God is saying?"
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.520]   No.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.820]   You just ripped a random verse out of Ezekiel.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.180]   And he wants you to know and understand.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.380]   And so for you to do that,
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.780]   you gotta recognize this word is true,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.180]   and you have to be a student of it,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.960]   an understanding of it.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.820]   The truth is, many of us don't wanna read the Bible
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.740]   because we just don't want to apply it to our life.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.860]   Like, we kinda like staying ignorant about it.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.220]   We don't want to know exactly all that is in there,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.580]   and we don't wanna have a bunch of rules,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.980]   or we even think of the Bible as a bunch of rules
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.180]   that God has given 'cause he's kind of a buzzkill
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.580]   of this, like, cosmic hall monitor.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.540]   Like, truly, I don't think anyone would say it that way,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.260]   but you, like, there's part of all of us,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.900]   at least myself, I'll say it,
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.420]   that thinks that God is up there and he's like,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.360]   "Hey, look, all right, you're gonna have some fun,
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.060]   "but too much fun, and I am turning the sun off.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.660]   "We are not doing this right now.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.460]   "This is too much, okay?
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.200]   "So if you add one too many to drink,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   "then I'm done with you.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.940]   "You are in timeout for the next three days."
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.100]   Or if I don't do something right,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.820]   that he's out there and he's just some cosmic hall monitor,
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.620]   and he's giving rules.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.260]   Come on, dude, there's so many of you.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.940]   You actually think this, and I want you to think
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.480]   about how illogical it is.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.660]   You think that God is there just giving rules
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.420]   'cause he's got nothing better to do.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.160]   He's like, "I'm God, I'm kinda up here alone.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.040]   "I got the angels over there, but I got nothing.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.100]   "All right, hey, you guys, stop sleeping together.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.940]   "No more fun over there, and no tobacco for you, mister."
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.700]   That's what you think God is doing.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.120]   And the Bible doesn't say that at all.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.720]   It says he gives the law, or he gives instructions
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.960]   and principles from the Bible to lead you to life
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.480]   because he loves you, he cares about you.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.760]   It's not that he has nothing better to do
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.400]   than be a buzzkill.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.240]   He cares about you.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.360]   Any dog parents in this room?
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.200]   Okay, great.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.000]   Think about the different, when, I'll say it this way.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.600]   When in my last house, there was a time in our home
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.160]   where we didn't have a fence in the backyard,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.360]   and not having a fence made it so where I couldn't
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.720]   let the dog go out in the backyard
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.500]   because he could just run away different places,
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.300]   he'd get hit by another car if he escaped.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   He could do different things.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.640]   And then we got a fence, a parameter
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.820]   that was put into his life, and he was given more freedom
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.700]   to go out and chase squirrels
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.860]   and do whatever dogs like to do.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.840]   And in doing so, a parameter led him to more freedom,
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.720]   not less freedom.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.780]   He wasn't in danger of his life being taken
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.420]   by running into a car.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.220]   And as any dog parent here, you love your dog,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.340]   you care about him like a parent loves children.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.260]   You care about them, and you don't give them rules,
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.340]   or you don't give instructions,
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.740]   you don't pull him out of the street
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.420]   or stop him from running in the street
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.020]   because you're there to rip your dog off.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.140]   You're like, no more fun for you, Mr. Sniffles.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:44.980]   Think about that.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.740]   That's what you think about God.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.260]   Like how ridiculous would it be if somebody was like,
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.700]   you know what, I just think these humans
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.140]   really like holding these dogs back.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.300]   That's what some people think about God
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.580]   when they go, man, he's just there to kind of give rules.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.880]   It's a big killjoy.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.140]   The God who's there gives parameters to enhance,
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.220]   to bring more freedom into your life, not less.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.720]   And whenever we live according to our own,
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.200]   just what seems right to me,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.560]   oftentimes we end up exchanging our freedom,
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.000]   or in the name of freedom, handing over that freedom,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.320]   and we're trapped, we're in bondage.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   Is an alcoholic who has the freedom to drink
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.520]   as much as he wants free
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.020]   when he can't go three days without having a drink?
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.780]   Is a pornography actor who has total freedom,
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.100]   he can do whatever he want.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.700]   Is he free when he can't go a month without looking at porn?
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.980]   No.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.700]   God isn't there to give rules to rip you off,
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.940]   and all the parameters that he gives
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.780]   are there to enhance freedom, to keep you free,
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.300]   to keep me free, not to take it away.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.380]   So the second idea is recognizing God's word is truth.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.480]   Your perspective may or may not be truth.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.300]   God's word is truth.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.180]   And finally, recognize when to share your perspective.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.460]   Or recognize, culture would say this is,
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.740]   recognize when to speak your truth,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.540]   'cause here's what is kind of true about that idea.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.280]   There are times the Bible commands you
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.680]   to speak your perspective, or your feelings,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.960]   what you're thinking, your opinion, your emotions.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.800]   You know that?
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.580]   In other words, the Bible, like this is crazy to me.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.420]   There's so many times in Scripture
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.020]   it says you need to speak these things.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.060]   You need to say certain things.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.260]   You need to express with your mouth,
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.940]   or articulate and communicate in different ways.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.140]   Like, if you're gonna follow Jesus,
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.220]   it involves you sharing your perspective on things,
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.380]   and recognizing when to share those things,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.140]   and what to share as relates to my perspective,
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.340]   is a part of following Jesus,
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.800]   and any maturing taking place inside of your life.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.140]   So here's some of the times as it relates
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.060]   to the things that you are commanded to speak.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.360]   They're related to, I'll set it up like this.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.620]   Who's heard the phrase, always, sometimes, never?
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.340]   Good, two of you, okay.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.980]   For the rest of you, let me educate.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.580]   There's things in life you always speak,
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.020]   sometimes you sometimes speak, you never speak.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.020]   That is a phrase that comes from,
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.060]   or the always, sometimes, never,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.860]   comes from really, first thing I've heard about it,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.180]   is it relates to wedding suits.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.840]   So I don't do a lot of weddings really that much anymore,
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.180]   but recently, because my suit that I've had
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.680]   for like 10 years has gotten too small,
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.900]   and I've ripped it in two back-to-back weddings.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.480]   Had it fixed, ripped it again, and it was like,
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.020]   oh man, I need to wave the towel,
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.100]   and I've put on too much weight.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.780]   So I got another suit, and as I was sitting there
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.100]   kind of getting fitted for the suit,
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.020]   it was a two-button suit, and they began to explain
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.380]   that there are certain suits that have three buttons,
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.620]   certain suits that have two,
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.900]   and if you have a three-button suit,
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.400]   it should look something like this.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.980]   That a three-button suit, there's sometimes,
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.400]   always, and never.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.500]   If you have a two-button suit,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.260]   then it is always and never.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.080]   Always and never.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.300]   In other words, just like in that scenario,
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   that's what it means, ladies,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.340]   in case this is just educational for you someday
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.100]   when a guy wears a suit, the bottom one,
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.860]   not even sure why we have it on there,
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.180]   but it's not supposed to be buttoned ever.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.340]   The middle one, apparently, is always supposed
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.440]   to be buttoned, and the top one, sometimes.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.860]   I don't know who makes these rules, but they're out there.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.740]   And if you have a two-button suit, she began to explain,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.820]   that is a always and a never.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.420]   But you never, never, ever button that bottom one.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.400]   In the same way, the Bible has certain things
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.320]   that are always speak and never speak.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.840]   Always speak and never speak.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.120]   There are certain things that you should always speak,
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.200]   always communicate.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.320]   What are some of those things
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.560]   as it relates to what you should share?
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.480]   You should always speak, or these are the truth,
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.060]   this is your perspective you should share.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.180]   You should always speak your hurts.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.880]   Matthew chapter 18, verses 14 and 15 says this.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.680]   We call this keeping short accounts.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.780]   When somebody's hurt you, especially if they're a believer,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.880]   I go to them and I say, hey, that hurt my feelings
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.360]   when you did X.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.200]   And I focus on the specific hurt, or the specific action,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.480]   two things I focus on, the action that they took
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.520]   and the emotion it created inside of me.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.920]   I don't focus on character, I don't focus on motive,
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.240]   I don't focus on this is just who you are, you're a bad apple
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.680]   you always do this type of thing.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.440]   I focus on the specific action, you didn't call me back.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.240]   And it made me feel like you don't care about me.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.440]   I focus on the specific action, the specific hurt,
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.540]   or the emotion that it created with me.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.640]   Proverbs chapter 19, verse 11 says that,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.200]   hey, if you can overlook it, if you can believe the best
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.680]   and overlook it, it is to one's glory to overlook an offense.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.980]   But if I'm hurt and I can't 'cause I keep replaying
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.800]   the tape of what they did, I go to that person
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.640]   and I speak my hurt.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.460]   What's another thing?
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.620]   You should always speak and confess your sins.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.320]   James chapter five, verse 16 says,
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.200]   you should have authentic relationships
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.800]   with people in your life, where you can confess your sins
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.080]   to one another so that you may be healed.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   That God says the healing process involves you confessing
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.280]   to another human, the different areas in your life
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.240]   where you are sinning.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.920]   You should have authentic relationships.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.120]   This is why we harp on small groups
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.000]   and community groups so much, so that if you're a guy,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.440]   you can have guys around you who are going,
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.220]   hey, look, I looked at pornography this week.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.180]   I was tempted to look at pornography.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.040]   I'm confessing where I'm tempted.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.220]   I just have had lustful thoughts running through my head
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.440]   about a past relationship.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.060]   That's a conversation that recently took place from me
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.960]   in my community group.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.200]   There's no perfect pastor up here
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.040]   who has it all together.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.560]   You need to have authentic relationships,
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.800]   and you should always speak and confess at a sin level,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.520]   at a temptation level, and have people in your life.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.800]   The third one, share your story.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.760]   Hebrews chapter 10, verse 24 and 25 talks about
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.640]   how we're to encourage one another and play a role
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.960]   in spurring each other on to loving good deeds.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.260]   How can I do that if I don't know your story?
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.900]   If I don't know the pain that you felt,
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.400]   the ways people have hurt you,
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.720]   the ways there's like a father wound
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.560]   or somebody walked out,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.520]   and just some of the baggage in your story.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.960]   You should share your story.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.840]   If there's sexual abuse, you should share that.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.120]   You don't need to be ashamed of that.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.360]   You need to know that 1 Thessalonians chapter four,
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.400]   verses one through three says,
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.560]   "God is the avenger of such people
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.160]   "and people who do such acts."
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.760]   But you don't need to be ashamed of that.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.720]   And you can bring that out in the light
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.440]   and share it with others so that they can better love
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.080]   and care and know you.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.520]   The fourth one, you should share your feelings.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.880]   Hebrews chapter three, verses 12 and 13 says
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.960]   that as it relates to like your heart and what you feel,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.600]   other people are God's provision for helping you
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.800]   kind of navigate the feelings and emotions
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.960]   that you have inside of your heart.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.100]   And they're the tools that God uses to be those
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.040]   who speak in and are like,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.300]   "Man, I know you're angry right now,
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.120]   "but what does the Bible say about anger?"
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.080]   That you should speak what you're feeling.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.640]   If you feel sexually oriented towards the same sex,
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.920]   you shouldn't feel like, "I can't share that,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.600]   "I'm ashamed of that, I'm embarrassed of that."
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.680]   You should feel the freedom to share that.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   If you feel like someone whose orientation is off
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.480]   or someone whose gender is off and not aligned
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.760]   with who God made you to be,
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.000]   you should feel the freedom to share that.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.600]   Then there's things you should never speak.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.060]   Oh, and then finally, the fifth always speak thing
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.880]   is Proverbs chapter 27, verse six,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.640]   that you should speak hard things.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.040]   You cannot be a good friend
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.360]   without being willing to tell the truth,
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   even when it's hard.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.000]   The Bible says, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend."
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.560]   You cannot be a good friend.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.240]   And you don't have good friends
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.120]   if you don't have people who are willing
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.640]   to tell you the hard truth, even when it's uncomfortable.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.840]   Five things, and I'm wrapping up
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.160]   'cause they're playing music behind me
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.320]   and it's starting to get spiritual in here.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.800]   Hopefully it's actually been spiritual for a while,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.440]   but five things you should never speak.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   When it's slander, Colossians chapter three, verse eight.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.180]   When it's speaking evil about someone, in other words.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.820]   When it's gossip, Proverbs chapter 20, verse 19.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.840]   When you're talking about someone and they're not present.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.480]   Inventing is what you call it and it is sin.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.760]   You should never speak gossip.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.580]   When it tears others down, Ephesians chapter four, verse 29.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.440]   You and I, how crazy would,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.560]   our city would change if this verse got applied.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.480]   Never say a word about anyone unless it's building them up.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.760]   Never.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.700]   When it's out of selfish motives.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.120]   If you're saying it just to make yourself,
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.080]   number four, look better, you shouldn't.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.420]   Philippians chapter two, verse three.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.380]   Do nothing out of selfish ambition.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.080]   Nothing, Paul, nothing out of selfish ambition.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.340]   And number five, when it is reckless.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.960]   Proverbs chapter 12, verse 18.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.440]   This is why we harp on community so much.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.720]   Life is hard, your 20s and 30s are hard,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.080]   but they are so much harder when you are alone.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.600]   And when you don't have a relationship
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.520]   with people that can come around and you can be real with.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.300]   In summary, recognize your perspective
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.500]   may or may not be truth.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.860]   God's word is truth.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.100]   And recognize when to share your perspective.
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.700]   As it relates to the idea of the chicken sandwich,
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.220]   there really isn't like a truth there.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.980]   That's totally opinion.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.620]   But as it relates to that Laurel, Yanny, there is a truth.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.660]   It may not be all the perspectives represented here,
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.660]   but the creator of it said, no, it's Laurel.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.940]   It is Laurel.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.180]   People may hear something different, but I created it.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.020]   I know it, I made it, it was Laurel.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.980]   It was for a script and for like a playwright
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.300]   that had Laurel in it, I believe.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.820]   The point being, you can find out what's true,
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.340]   but going back to the creator
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.620]   and seeking to understand what is true.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.620]   You know what one of the marks of those,
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.900]   Paul says in Romans chapter one,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.440]   who are underneath the wrath of God,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.940]   we're about to land the flame.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.980]   He says, here's how you can know
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.620]   someone is underneath the wrath of God.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.380]   They have exchanged the truth about God
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.260]   for a lie.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.300]   And they worshiped and served,
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.180]   created things rather than the creator
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.900]   who is forever praised, amen.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.700]   They exchanged the truth and they took on a lie.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.260]   They didn't realize they were doing it.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.180]   They may not have even intentionally did it.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.740]   But Paul says, you know what?
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.580]   When someone is under the wrath of God,
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.740]   they pushed aside the truth of what God's word says.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.260]   This is how sexuality should exist.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.100]   This is the purpose in life.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.660]   This is what life is ultimately all about.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.820]   I'm pushing that aside, pushing God's word aside.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.260]   I'm pushing all of that truth aside
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.300]   and in its place, I'm putting my opinion.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:26.620]   Our culture is embodying what Paul said.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.940]   It looks like to be underneath the wrath of God.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.420]   By pushing aside the truth and embracing a lie.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.540]   But here's the good news.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.100]   All over our country right now,
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   there are young adults who are rising up
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.500]   like many inside of this room,
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.940]   like many inside of those who are listening right here.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.820]   And they're saying, we're not gonna,
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.940]   we're gonna live according to what this book says.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.540]   What it says about where life is found,
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.900]   what it says about sexuality,
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.100]   what it says about marriage, how I should date,
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.380]   how I should live, how I should spend my time.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.380]   They're rising up and they're saying,
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.860]   I'm not gonna buy the lie of Miley Cyrus
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.060]   and everybody else who I can clearly see,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.380]   live however you want does not work.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.940]   It doesn't work for them, it's never worked for anyone.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.620]   And I'm gonna surrender my life
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.020]   and I'm not gonna do it perfectly,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.220]   but I'm gonna do it purposefully
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.820]   and I'm gonna try to apply what God says in here
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.300]   and take it and apply it to my life
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.540]   and I'm gonna live that way.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.940]   And many in this room are doing it,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.420]   many in different campuses right now.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.260]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.420]   In Austin, Texas, in El Paso, Texas,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.780]   Tulsa, Sweetwater, Texas, El Paso,
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.340]   mentioned it again, Houston, Nashville, Philadelphia,
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.420]   Cedar Rapids, Menhill, North Carolina,
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.900]   Fayetteville, Woodland Spring, Phoenix,
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.740]   Cincinnati and other locations,
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.900]   young adults by the thousands right now
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   are listening in at various Ports Live locations
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.200]   and their people coming together saying,
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.820]   we're going to live according to what this book says.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.900]   We're gonna follow God.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.140]   God is, my heart will not be my God.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.580]   I'm gonna let God be the Lord of my heart
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.340]   and I'm gonna surrender and walk with him
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.220]   and it is gonna change our country.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:55.740]   This is a generation that will redefine the church.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.340]   It's gonna redefine the church for 100 generations.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.420]   I believe that with all of my heart
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.740]   by realigning with what God's word says,
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.340]   by men and women saying, I'm not gonna,
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.660]   nobody comes with me.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.840]   I'm not gonna date like Taylor Swift tells me to date.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.520]   I'm not gonna live like all of the celebrity culture
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.320]   and Hollywood tells me, this is where life is found.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.000]   Shortly before they overdose.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.260]   Because tragically, they haven't found still
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.000]   what they're looking for.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.640]   But everywhere, and not just at these different locations,
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.320]   just men and women in this generation
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.640]   all over the country saying, I'm gonna follow Jesus
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.320]   and I'm gonna live according to what he says
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.400]   and they're experiencing life.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.660]   And the same God who's there offers that extension
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.020]   and invitation to you if you will live according
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.860]   to his word, that's not how you have eternal life.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.020]   Jesus said in John chapter 14, let me close here.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.020]   He said a really remarkable thing.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.100]   Sitting around, it's one of his last conversations
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.940]   with his boys.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.180]   And he begins to talk about heaven.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.880]   And he says this in John chapter 14 verse six.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:03.740]   I am the way, I am the truth,
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.140]   and I am the life.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.700]   No one comes to the father except through me.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:15.300]   Jesus says, truth is not something you define,
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.640]   truth is not something that changes, truth is a person.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.900]   Truth has a name and it is Jesus, and it is in knowing him
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.580]   and walking with him.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.780]   All of life begins to make sense, everything dysfunctional,
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.600]   it doesn't overnight just snap in perfectly,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.580]   but everything in this world begins to click
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.740]   and I begin to see it more clearly.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.740]   But Jesus says, he puts purpose and all of life in focus.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.540]   Because truth and all of the word in scriptures
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.680]   and the things in God's word were meant to point
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.860]   to God's son, who John chapter one says
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.820]   is the ultimate word of God.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.700]   And in walking with him and in living according
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.860]   to his word, there is life.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:03.180]   Or you can exchange the truth of God for a lie.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.060]   And when you do, Paul says the same thing happens
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.820]   every time you experience distance from your creator
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.180]   and destruction in your life.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.860]   Let me pray.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.500]   Father, thank you.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:27.800]   That you have reached into so many of our hearts
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.600]   in this room, into those listening,
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.500]   and you have allowed us to see the truth of God
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.620]   in the face of Jesus.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:41.940]   Thank you that you have not left us without instruction,
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.120]   but you've given us through your word, principles,
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.760]   teachings, things meant to lead us to life,
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.740]   to help us navigate what it looks like today,
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.420]   to live, to work, to have healthy relationships,
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.620]   to not feel alone, to not be alone.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.980]   Thank you that you love us.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.860]   I pray for anyone in this room who has not experienced
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.260]   encountering the truth of Jesus.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.340]   There's nothing that I could do, no message that I could
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.700]   give, no music that we could play that could allow someone
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.620]   to see the reality and the truth of Jesus.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.420]   He alone is the way to heaven exclusively.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.180]   He alone is the way to life, and he alone,
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.740]   just like truth is exclusive,
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.700]   is the God who is there, who came and put on human flesh
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.740]   to die in our place, and he calls us to truth,
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.860]   and in his word we find truth.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.020]   Would you help any of our friends who've never experienced
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.000]   and trusted tonight, whether they're in this room
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.540]   or in the 20 different locations listening?
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.300]   Tonight is their night, God.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.940]   Would you whisper and do what only you can do,
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.060]   which is stretch out your hand and say,
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   we love you and we worship you now in song,
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.460]   and we believe, and we see a generation rising up.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.100]   It will change the church and call it back
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.220]   to realigning with what the church was always intended
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.340]   to be, the people of God living by the word of God,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.380]   walking with the son of God.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.020]   We worship you now in song, amen.
