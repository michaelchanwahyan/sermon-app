[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.240]   All right, Ports, how we doing?
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.080]   We doing okay tonight?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   Great to see you.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.960]   Welcome back.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   So glad that you would make your time to be here with us this
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.440]   Tuesday and particularly in this series.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   I don't know what it is.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.000]   I just have so much expectation for what God is going to do as
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.920]   we read his word and we work our way through this series.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.000]   And it's not just an expectation for what he's doing here in
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.800]   Dallas, Texas, though we love you and we think he's doing
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000]   something tremendous here.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.160]   It's also an expectation for what he is doing all over the
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.560]   nation.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   So if you're tuning in with us right now, welcome.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.080]   We love that you're a part of the porch wherever it is you
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.280]   are.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.800]   We're firm believers that God can meet with any person at any
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.840]   place at any time, including you.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.200]   Special shout out to Portslide, Springfield, Scottsdale, and
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360]   Fresno.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.760]   Hey, Fresno, give it up, you know.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.680]   Hey, I want to dive into this, but I want to make sure that we
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.360]   take a moment and we pray.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   Again, I'm a firm believer in this space, if you're not
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.040]   familiar, that my goal is not to be the weekly entertainment.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.720]   I do not want to stand up here and just be the man in the
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240]   arena and preach to a large room.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.960]   I really want you to meet with God himself because I'm a firm
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.280]   believer.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   He wants to meet with you.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.600]   So can we just pray for a moment?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240]   Would you be willing to do that?
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.120]   God, we're so grateful that we have a moment here with you.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   It's good to be near you.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.200]   God, we know that we're always near to you, God, that for those
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.040]   that have placed their faith in your son for the forgiveness of
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.840]   their sins, nothing can separate us from your love.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   And yet, God, oftentimes we grow desensitized to the fact that
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   you're close.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720]   More, God, than even that.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.920]   We grow discouraged to the fact that it is in your heart to be
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.120]   close.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.640]   And so, God, right now we just want to quiet ourselves, still
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.440]   ourselves in your presence and be reminded you're here.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   Take a moment, if you would, and pray for yourself.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.720]   Just ask, "God, would you speak to me?"
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.240]   As you talk to him, know that you don't speak to an empty and
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.320]   vaulted ceiling.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.960]   You speak to a living and true God.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   And then if you would, would you pray for me?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.440]   I need the Lord.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.400]   I'm asking that his spirit would help me here.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.920]   I have nothing good to give you.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.160]   Only he has good to give.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760]   So would you pray for me and ask that he would speak through me
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   to be helpful to you?
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:23.040]   Well, Father, we come with a really humble expectation
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   tonight, knowing, God, that there's nothing within us that
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.680]   deserves anything from you, but believing, God, that it's in
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.960]   your heart to give to us because you love us and you gladly
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960]   lavish, God, your favor upon those who seek you.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.840]   We seek you tonight, and it is in your name we pray.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   Amen.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.160]   Well, I'm not exactly the type to relive my football glory days
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.240]   from high school, but there is one moment that I think would
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.840]   make Hollywood very proud.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.400]   Now, this moment is not the moment that you would likely
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.000]   expect.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.920]   It wasn't in the pouring rain beneath Friday night lights
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.000]   against our crosstown rival en route to the state
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.680]   championship.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.360]   It wasn't that kind of moment.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.640]   It was actually in the moment that you would not expect.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.320]   It was in the middle of offseason during conditioning.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.640]   I do not remember why, but for whatever reason, on this day,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.040]   our coaches collectively decided that we had not worked hard
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   enough and we clearly needed to do a lot of conditioning.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.280]   Now, the choice in conditioning for my coaches
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.560]   was always in a tune of up-downs.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.440]   I don't know if you know what up-downs are.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   If you don't, consider yourself blessed.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.320]   Up-downs are exactly as the name implies.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.640]   You're up, and then you're down.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.360]   And then you're up, and then you're down.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.000]   You throw yourself to the ground,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.960]   and then you pick yourself up back up off the ground.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.520]   I'm convinced that if ever I get into a fist fight,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.720]   all I need to do is throw that person to the earth
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   and have them get up, and then throw them to the earth
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.720]   and have them get back up.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.920]   Because it is exhausting.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.440]   There's nothing quite like this form of conditioning.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.320]   And the thing is, you do them until either your coach
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.920]   tells you to stop or you die.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.320]   It's kind of the way that this sort of conditioning works.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.760]   And for whatever reason, my coach was nowhere close
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.400]   to blowing the whistle in this moment.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.600]   He just continued to whistle over and over and over
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.440]   and over and over again, calling us to continue
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.540]   in this form of conditioning until the sun had gone down,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.080]   guys had lost their lunch, and I was convinced
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.240]   this is the place that the Lord was gonna call me home.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.540]   All hope seemed lost.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.080]   That is, until a guy standing one row in front of me,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.320]   where the captain's always stood, decided to yell out,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.720]   "We want more, coach!"
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.140]   I know you're captain, but that's not in fact true
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.960]   for the rest of us.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.000]   "We're hungry, coach!"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.640]   It is past dinner time, but I don't think
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.220]   that's what you mean.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.440]   "We ain't tired!"
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.720]   If you're not looking around you,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.180]   perhaps you've missed the fact that we are exhausted.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.600]   That guy hasn't been up for the last 15 minutes.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.280]   He's laid out flat.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.640]   "We want more!"
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   Dude, I think you think this looks cooler
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.800]   than it actually is, but it is not cool at all.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.840]   At least that's what I thought, until the guys around me
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.440]   started agreeing with him, joining him,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.920]   chanting alongside him, "More, more, more, more,"
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.080]   and I felt like a man on an island all by himself.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   Because I did not want more, but what I noticed
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.080]   in this moment, as we all collectively unified
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.000]   around this common cry for more, stirred about
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.280]   by a great movement within our heart,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.000]   something moved within my coach's heart.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.600]   I could see it in his face.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.400]   I looked at him very specifically,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.760]   and what I saw was a look of pride cast across his gaze,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.520]   as we gave him exactly what he wanted.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.440]   We played right into his hand.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.240]   He was looking for his team to become united
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.380]   under the common bond of a unifying desire.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.880]   Now, why do I tell you all of that?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.560]   Because when it comes to revival,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.160]   God often works through a people
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.800]   found not in the expected places,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.820]   not in massive stadiums with packed out crowds
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.760]   and star-studded lineups and all the high drama
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.920]   of an amazing event.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.960]   He can work in that space, yes,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.360]   but where he most often works
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.120]   is he works in the unexpected places,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.600]   the proverbial equivalent of off-season.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.020]   He works in the ordinarity, the simplicity,
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.440]   the mediocrity of life, and it's in those places
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.440]   that he is looking for a very specific group of people.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.920]   He's looking for a group of people
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.480]   that, like my teammates and I,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   were united by a common bond and cry for something more,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.280]   which begs the question,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.360]   "What more, Kylan, should I want for?"
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.640]   You should want for more of him.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.300]   You see, God is looking for a people
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.100]   that are looking for him,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.480]   that are hungry for his presence,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.360]   that are longing for his power,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.260]   that are seeking after his person.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.500]   You see, the degree of our desire for God,
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   not always, but often, determines his response to us.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.480]   So how do we deepen our desire, our longing?
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.240]   How do we stir up our yearning for more of God?
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.480]   How do you cultivate hunger?
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.840]   That's what I wanna talk to you about tonight.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   And the way that we're gonna do it
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.800]   is we're gonna work through a few verses
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.160]   in Isaiah chapter 55.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.480]   So if you have a Bible, you can grab it,
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   you can turn with me to Isaiah 55.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.720]   If you don't have a copy of the scripture, don't worry.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.040]   It's all gonna be on the screens behind me.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.220]   We're in the middle of a new series called Revive,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.640]   where we're exploring all of the concepts
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.660]   that surround this idea of revival.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.640]   I don't know if you're aware,
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.500]   we unpacked it a little bit last week,
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.280]   but we're standing in the middle
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.720]   of a really interesting and unique moment of history
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.680]   where there's a surge of spirituality
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.120]   that is spreading across not just our country,
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.720]   but really the globe.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.980]   I won't unpack all of the data for you again,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.160]   but what's being called the quiet revival
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.600]   has been distinguished by a particular rise
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.740]   in commitments to Christ, church attendance abroad,
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.520]   higher levels of satisfaction within those
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.240]   that claim Christ as opposed to those
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.880]   that do not claim Christ,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.360]   lower levels of anxiety and depression,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.480]   and young men outpacing women in their return to the faith,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.840]   which is just wild.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.320]   Ladies, take this as an encouragement.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.720]   If you haven't met him yet, he might in fact be on his way.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.880]   Gentlemen, take this as a word of warning.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.680]   The competition's about to get stiff.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   So if you haven't made your move, they're coming.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.260]   I don't know if you've seen, but the tide has turned
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.600]   and the men are on the return.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   You need to make your move, take your shot
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.260]   as soon as I speak.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.340]   We are in the early phases of a new move of God.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.460]   And here's the thing.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.100]   I desperately do not want us to miss it.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.340]   Now let me be very, very clear,
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.200]   because this was a great concern of mine
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   as I knew we were going to kind of engage this topic.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.540]   I am not angling for us to be the apex moment
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.380]   in awakening history,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.780]   but I am aiming for us to be a part of awakening history.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.500]   Like, I want God to do in here what he's doing out there.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.100]   I'm asking the Lord, begging him still to actually move,
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.060]   not just in our day, but in this room and in your lives.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.100]   I'm praying that God would give us greater intimacy
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.300]   with Jesus, that we would see conversions
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.740]   of the least likely, that he would release you
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.780]   into your destinies, that we would see generational sin
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.220]   broken on the anvil of what Christ has come to accomplish,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.420]   that we would see his kingdom come here to Dallas
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.660]   and wherever it is you're tuning in, as it is in heaven.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.720]   That's what I'm praying he would do.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.540]   But here's the thing that we have to know.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.660]   Though we would unapologetically want
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.900]   to see more of God move,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.260]   the way he moves in meaningful change
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.700]   at a broader level comes through meaningful change
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.780]   at an inner level.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.600]   You do not find revival by seeking revival.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.460]   You find revival by seeking renewal.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.540]   At least that's the way that Mark Sayers,
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.180]   who's been a great influence to me on this topic
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.580]   as I've been studying, puts it.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.020]   I like the way that he actually writes this
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.540]   in his book, "Reappearing Church."
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.540]   He says, "Revival is when renewal occurs on a large scale,
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.920]   "bringing significant advancement, growth,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.660]   "and kingdom fruit to a city, a people group,
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.780]   "a movement, region, or nations."
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.380]   He says, "Revival is renewal gone viral."
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.100]   If we want to see a widespread change,
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.940]   then there needs to be an individual change.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.860]   Do you get that?
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.980]   And so what we're trying to walk through in this series
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.520]   is what do those steps look like?
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.900]   How do we produce personal renewal?
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.780]   How do we change what's happening in the inner man
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.140]   or inner woman so that way God might change
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.740]   what's happening in the outer world?
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.340]   We can't move his hand in terms of how it affects
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.340]   everyone here, but we can change what's happening in here.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.140]   And the history books would agree with this philosophy.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.540]   Like by and large, outpourings of the spirit
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.740]   or moments of awakening or revival or revolution
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.140]   or renewal, whatever you want to call it,
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.300]   whatever your preferred terminology is
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.100]   when it comes to this topic, all throughout history,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.460]   they have been marked first and foremost,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.080]   not by technique, not by charisma,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   they have been marked by two things, humility and hunger.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.180]   Humility and hunger.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.700]   In the Welsh Revival, which saw 90,000 people
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.980]   come to Christ in just one year,
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.260]   its origins can be traced back to a small prayer gathering
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.460]   of one coal mining preacher named Evan Roberts
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.340]   and 16 teenagers who wanted God.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.820]   And the social impact was crazy.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.240]   Like just to give you some perspective
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.940]   of what happened there in Wales,
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.580]   like crime rates plummeted to the point
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.100]   that there was no one for the magistrates to try.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.180]   In court, police officers, they ran out of work to do,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.300]   that they started creating singing quartets
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.100]   to perform in pubs.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.460]   They found that alcohol sales dropped so dramatically
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.140]   as thousands gave up drinking.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.260]   And in one instance, some of the coal miners
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.380]   who used pit ponies to resource their sort of materials
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.260]   in and out of the mines could not actually communicate
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.700]   with the horses because, well, the horses were so accustomed
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.640]   to really vile language.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.520]   They were used to expletives and cursory language.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.080]   And these coal miners had stopped speaking
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.280]   in such an inappropriate way
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.560]   that the animals couldn't even understand them.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.880]   That's how massively God moved in the Welsh Revival.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   In the Ulster Revival, there were 100,000 people
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.200]   that came to faith.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.080]   And guess where it originated?
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.780]   Within four Sunday school teachers
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.960]   that agreed to pray together in Ireland.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.220]   It started in the humble place.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.340]   The Hebrides Revival was an outpouring of the spirit
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.060]   that struck the Scottish Hebrides after two sisters,
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.020]   one 82-year-old named Peggy
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.580]   and one 84-year-old named Christine Smith
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.660]   started praying for God to move in their parish.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.500]   They looked around their church
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.540]   and they saw no young people
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.980]   and they felt a deep need for God to move in
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.260]   and bring young people to their church.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.560]   And what they found as they began to pray
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.680]   is that an awakening would come to the Hebrides,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.620]   the likes of which people could not explain.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.980]   There were spontaneous outpourings of the spirit
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.140]   where entire villages would awaken in the morning
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.300]   and men and women would be on their knees in repentance.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.620]   You would drive down the road
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.380]   and the roadsides would be filled with people
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.660]   on their knees crying out to God in mercy.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.740]   One famous story recalls a dance hall
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.880]   where a group of young adults like you and I
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.940]   were gathered together
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.740]   and yet they felt such conviction from the spirit
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.000]   that they all left the dance hall
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.740]   and they went to the church to pray instead.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.180]   This was the Hebridean revival, the businessman's revival.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.460]   10,000 to 30,000 people
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.100]   began attending regular prayer meetings in New York
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.420]   because one businessman organized
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.940]   weekly noontime prayer meetings
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.080]   for anyone that would want to attend.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.880]   And this led to hundreds of thousands of converts
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.540]   in only one year's time as estimated by historians.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.100]   The English revival was John Wesley famous, his companions.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.460]   They prayed until the entire country
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.420]   was aroused by the gospel again.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.880]   And the Moravian revival,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   which began as a 24/7 prayer movement by refugees,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.700]   ultimately was moved so powerfully by the spirit of God
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.500]   that what was originally just a week long's worth of prayer,
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.580]   24/7 within a week's time,
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.380]   extended to 110 years nonstop 24/7.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.560]   This is what God does
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.780]   when the humble and the hungry seek after him.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.380]   Why would God use teenagers and old ladies
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.020]   and refugees and coal miners and business people
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.340]   to produce revival?
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.060]   Why would he do this?
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.820]   Because they want for him.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.380]   We should want for him too.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.220]   What do you think God might do in your spheres of influence
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.300]   if you actually want for him in a very similar way?
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.700]   God cares about the level of your longing.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.100]   And so for the rest of our time,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.860]   I want to talk to you about how you deepen it.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.100]   There are three things that you need to know specifically.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.860]   The first of which is we are creatures of desire.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.620]   We are creatures of desire.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.140]   That's at least how Isaiah begins to unpack it
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.220]   when he gets into verse one.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.940]   He says this, talking about creatures of desire,
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.940]   "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.520]   "And he who has no money, come buy and eat.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.540]   "Come buy wine and milk without money and without price."
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.980]   Don't you hear it in the text?
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.260]   God is speaking to a people who hunger and who thirst,
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.780]   which are representative of a people
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.740]   that long for something, that want for something,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.220]   that yearn for something, that are seeking after something.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.460]   And the reason for that is intrinsic within the heart
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.460]   of all people is that quality which bases its decisions
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.940]   on an internal desire.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.140]   Like every decision you make in life
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.420]   is rooted in what you desire most,
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.700]   not in what you've disciplined yourself for
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.700]   or what you feel called to be dutiful in.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.180]   You may hear that and think, "Kylin, no,
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.260]   "I make plenty of decisions where discipline and duty
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.780]   "are the primary motivating forces
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.060]   "behind why I do what I do.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.900]   "I don't wanna pay my bills."
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.780]   You think I desire to do that?
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.700]   "I don't wanna get up and go to the gym."
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.300]   No way.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.340]   Blind date?
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.180]   That's not exactly fun when a friend wants to set me up.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.780]   You think I wanna mow my grass?
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.380]   There are plenty of areas of your life
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.100]   where you may look and think, "I don't desire that thing.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.020]   "I am disciplined for it and I feel a duty to it."
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.180]   And yet, though you may not desire the object itself,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.500]   you desire what it produces.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.820]   You may not wanna mow the grass,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.300]   but you do want to avoid the watchful HOAI
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.620]   or that nosy neighbor living next door.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.300]   You may not necessarily wanna go to the gym,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.600]   but you really do desire the benefits that the gym produces,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.760]   the kind of body that it actually creates.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.140]   You may not wanna pay your bills,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.200]   but you like the comfort that paying your bills produces.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   Blind dates are tough.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.140]   You don't know who you're sitting across the table from,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.940]   and yet we all wanna find love.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.140]   You are driven by desire when you boil it down
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.980]   to its most essential place.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.500]   You see, every decision we make,
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.980]   every action we take, every word we speak
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.940]   is all driven by your greatest desire in that moment.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.580]   And it's the reason why.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.680]   All throughout the Gospels,
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.620]   whenever Jesus engages with people,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.340]   he does so on the basis of their desire.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.740]   You ever notice this?
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.160]   It's fascinating, because when you study the Scripture,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.980]   not every interaction,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.300]   but any time someone approaches Jesus,
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.940]   most often he is engaging them
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.860]   with some sort of interaction that is testing their desire.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.180]   If they come to him,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.620]   he may confront them with a question about their desire,
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.860]   or he may commend them with some encouragement
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.860]   for their desire.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.900]   In Mark 10, he talks to a guy named Blind Bartimaeus.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.300]   Bartimaeus, being blind, wants what a blind man would want.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.500]   Give me my sight, Jesus.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.900]   And yet Jesus looks at Bartimaeus and says,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.260]   "What do you want?"
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.780]   Jesus says, "Obvious."
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.620]   He wants to see.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.020]   And yet Jesus wants to know what Bart desires.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.940]   When Jesus encounters the first disciples
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.340]   in the first chapter of John,
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.460]   he looks at them and he asks them the question,
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.140]   "What are you seeking?"
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.980]   Do you hear it?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.260]   That's a question testing desire.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.060]   When James and John want to sit at the right hand of Jesus,
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.120]   he looks at them and he asks them,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.240]   "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.640]   Another question of desire.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.300]   When he finds Mary at the tomb following his resurrection,
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.220]   weeping, he comes to her and he asks, "Whom do you seek?"
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.460]   Well, it's obvious.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.420]   She's at your tomb.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.900]   He wants to know what it is she desires.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.540]   Zacchaeus, that wee little man,
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.820]   he climbed up into a tree.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.660]   Why?
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.940]   Because he sought to see him.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.080]   He wanted to see Jesus, the Canaanite woman
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.180]   that wanted a few morsels of crumbs from Jesus's table.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.580]   What did he do?
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.380]   He kind of dodged her for a minute until she pursued him.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.460]   And then what he realized is her desire was so great
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.900]   that he had not seen a faith like hers.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   Whenever you get to the two men
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.780]   that were both blind seeking after Jesus,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.240]   they cry out, "Son of David, have mercy."
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.500]   And yet Jesus, he dodges them as well
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   because then they seek him more.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.180]   And he realizes these men, they want,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.360]   not just for the blessing, they want the blessed sir.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.100]   The rich ruler, what did he do?
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.200]   He comes to Jesus and Jesus looks at him and says,
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.460]   "Hey, give everything away and follow me."
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.300]   Why?
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.820]   "I want to test the depth of your desire to be with me."
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   Bleeding woman pushes through a crowd.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.380]   Jesus could have moved on.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.780]   He had given power plenty of times before.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.720]   And yet in that moment, he engages with her.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.560]   Why?
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.020]   To commend her faith.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.800]   People that brought their paralytic friend to Jesus
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   and they dug through the roof
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.460]   and they lowered him on a mat.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.260]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.660]   Like Jesus, he says he saw their faith.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.840]   What does that mean?
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.400]   They didn't show up with shovels
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.900]   and excavation tools at hand thinking,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.740]   "You know what?
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.640]   We're gonna have to lower this guy through the roof."
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.480]   No, they showed up thinking,
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.460]   "We're gonna just bring him to Jesus."
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.460]   And yet they couldn't get to Jesus
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.860]   until they decided to hop up on the roof
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.900]   and start clawing their way through
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.460]   until they could get their friend down.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.180]   They had a deep desire to get to Jesus.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.420]   What is the point in all of those explanations?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.780]   All of which are not actually cumulative.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.660]   Jesus responds to the degree of our desire.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.900]   And based on verse one,
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.260]   he gives us a really good reason to desire to be near to him.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.980]   He gives you three incentives.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.020]   As he unpacks it, he offers water, milk, and wine,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.980]   which at first glance may not stand out.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.740]   But those three things are very different
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.620]   from one another.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.100]   And so too is that which they offer.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.460]   If you think about it, water does what?
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.900]   Water provides refreshment.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.120]   If you're thirsty, you don't want a tall glass of milk.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.660]   Ron Bergen, he said so himself.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.060]   Milk was a bad choice.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.140]   You don't want milk, you want water.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.960]   Why?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.900]   Because it's refreshing.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.300]   It's reviving.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.260]   It's restoring to a person.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.980]   Ever be outside on a really hot day,
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.020]   take a drink of cold water and feel it
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.380]   move from your mouth down your throat and into your stomach?
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.460]   It is the greatest feeling in the world.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.540]   Try it sometime.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.100]   But he doesn't just simply decry milk.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.340]   He also says, no, milk serves a different purpose
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.500]   because where water serves for your refreshment,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.620]   milk serves for your nourishment.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.220]   Just last week, my wife and I,
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.380]   we took our newborn son, Cash, six months,
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.820]   and he had his six month checkup.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.580]   What we found out from that meeting
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.720]   is that he's north of the 90th percentile
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.260]   in both weight and height,
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.420]   which just means he's a very big boy.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.060]   Why is he so big?
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.340]   Because he's never missed a meal in his life.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.700]   Some of you are not growing
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.820]   because you are spiritually malnourished.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.740]   You are not feeding on that which will actually
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.260]   provide for your nourishment.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.180]   Instead of taking in more of God's word,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.840]   you're focused on taking in season three
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.280]   of the White Lotus.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.960]   Not condemning your favorite show,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.700]   but what I am saying is you are starving your spirituality
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.820]   when you mistake entertainment for nourishment.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.840]   You have to take in the milk that he offers.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.080]   And then the last one that he offers is wine.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.680]   And he's certainly not talking about the cheap stuff
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.560]   that comes in a box.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.960]   Water is for your refreshment.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.920]   Milk is for your nourishment.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   Wine is for your enjoyment.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.280]   Have you ever thought about this?
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.300]   Christianity is supposed to be fun.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.760]   Like in the sense that it should free you
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.660]   from living a solitary life of pragmatism,
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.240]   stoicism, and chillness.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.720]   Like you should actually feel a deep sense of delight
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.640]   in the world.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.480]   Like it should free you to a childlike wonder
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   where you adventure things the way that God intended
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   for them to be experienced.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.320]   Like it should catapult you to actually see in the world
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   all the goodness that God has imbued
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.480]   within every single individual element.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.440]   You're supposed to enjoy life
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.680]   in a godly way to be very clear.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.240]   Friends, we are creatures of desire and Jesus knows it.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.480]   And so he has given us every reason to desire him.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.920]   As C.S. Lewis puts it,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.560]   "If I find in myself a desire which no experience
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.960]   in the world can satisfy,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.400]   the most probable explanation is that I was made
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.920]   for another world.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.560]   If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.400]   that does not prove that the universe is a fraud.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.740]   Probably, earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.760]   but only to arouse it to suggest the real thing."
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.320]   You see, your desire points to a greater satisfier.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.160]   And all of our satisfaction is found in Christ.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.960]   If you want to cultivate your hunger for more of God,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.440]   to see where it is,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.160]   you have to see where it is you're wanting
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   and realize he's the answer for it.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.600]   So if you feel weary,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.960]   like if you're looking into your life
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.360]   and you feel a deep sense of weariness
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.880]   over the fact that, man, you can't keep a job,
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.520]   or you're facing chronic illness,
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.320]   or you're stuck when everyone else seems to be racing ahead,
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.240]   you should know where you're weary.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.800]   He has water.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.720]   He can refresh you.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.280]   Where you feel weak, tired of your singleness,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.880]   wondering why God has left you
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   in this specific relationship status
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.400]   when everyone else seems to be moving forward,
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.640]   overwhelmed by how behind you feel.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.160]   If you feel weak, he has milk for you,
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.320]   that which will strengthen you.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.800]   If you feel waned,
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.600]   just discouraged by where you're at in life,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.360]   apathetic on your best day,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.720]   coping nightly just to get through the week,
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.040]   he looks at you and he says, "Hey, I have wine for you.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.440]   I have enjoyment for you.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.240]   I can give you delight,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.440]   the likes of which this world cannot provide you."
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.160]   This is the heart of Jesus towards you.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.400]   He has everything you want and more.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.840]   We're creatures of desire,
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.280]   and all of our desire should drive us deeper into God,
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.640]   and yet often, they do not drive us deeper into God,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.960]   do they?
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.280]   Often, our desire leads us further from God
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.320]   rather than near to God.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.640]   That's what Isaiah says.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.120]   He moves into verse two, and he says,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.200]   "Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.120]   and your labor for that which does not satisfy?
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.920]   Listen diligently to me and eat what is good.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.800]   Delight yourselves in rich food."
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.240]   I think this verse paints a really profound picture
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.560]   when you inspect it for what it's saying.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.120]   Like what you see in this verse,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.360]   it's not a picture of an angry judge banging a gavel
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.440]   and casting his verdict.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.360]   You don't see someone that is muttering under his breath,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.560]   disappointment, "Oh my gosh,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.000]   when are they just gonna finally realize
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.920]   that I am the one that gives all satisfaction?"
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.160]   You don't see in this verse a picture of God
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.200]   clasping his hands and begging you to believe
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.280]   that he's the source of all your joy.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   That's not what you see.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.960]   What you see is a picture of an inquirer.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.980]   You see God ask a question.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.440]   He just asks why.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.380]   Like why is it that you spend your money
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.200]   on that which is not bread yet want to be filled?
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.280]   Why is it that you work, you labor
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.880]   in an area that does not produce your satisfaction?
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.600]   You see, he doesn't make an emotional appeal to you.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.440]   He makes a logical appeal.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.180]   He's looking at you and he's saying,
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.600]   "Hey, why are you doing that which is really unproductive?"
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.240]   Anybody in here hate getting to the end of your day
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.360]   and feeling like, "Man, this was just
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.680]   the most unproductive day."
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.760]   He's looking at you and he's saying,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.400]   "Hey, come on in.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.000]   Why don't you take a seat?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.480]   Why don't we talk about what's been happening here?
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.560]   It seems like you're spinning your wheels
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.680]   and you're not making the kind of progress
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.780]   you want to be making when it comes to your satisfaction."
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.820]   I remember in my first job right out of college,
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.720]   there was a guy in the company,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.040]   who he was a mid-level management.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.480]   He'd been around for a really long time.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.080]   He's kind of grandfathered in.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.700]   That just sort of meandered around the office space
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.400]   every single day.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.680]   Full of activity, but not a lot of productivity.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.280]   Like to the point that everyone noticed
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.360]   and so we just started making wagers
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   on what he was gonna do next.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   Like it sort of became this kind of spectator sport.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.460]   So we'd look at him and we'd wonder.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.640]   Maybe he's going to the kitchen
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.140]   to grab another cup of coffee.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.420]   You know what, perhaps he's going by HR
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.380]   because he really likes the girl
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.360]   that works at the front desk.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.560]   You know what, no, maybe he's gonna swing
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.400]   by product development because he just wants to test
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.760]   whatever the newest, latest, greatest thing is
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.880]   that they've been cooking up.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920]   We would always wager because this guy,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.360]   he was really accustomed to being,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.580]   he was full of movement,
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.200]   but he really wasn't going anywhere.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.840]   He was full of activity, but not a lot of productivity.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   God is looking at you when it comes
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.680]   to your pursuit of desire and he's saying,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   hey, it looks like maybe you and he have something in common.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.020]   There's a lot of busyness, but not a lot of traction.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.400]   You seem like you're seeking satisfaction,
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.720]   but you're not really accomplishing it.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.880]   You see, God is not making an emotional appeal
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.840]   in this moment because he doesn't need
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.680]   to make an emotional appeal.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.240]   He's making a logical appeal.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.920]   Why doesn't God need to make an emotional appeal?
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.760]   Because we don't need to be emotionally convinced
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.040]   that the things of this world will not satisfy
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.840]   because we feel that in our inner being.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.120]   It doesn't matter if you believe in Jesus
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.920]   or you don't believe in Jesus.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.680]   Go out with friends, black out drunk, you feel shame.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.260]   You want to feel something nice,
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.840]   you look at porn, but it leaves you feeling empty.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.560]   You want to find some success,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.720]   measure up in the eyes of others,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.280]   so you work really hard at the office
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.320]   and yet it leaves you feeling exhausted.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.120]   You want desperately to be accepted by other people
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.600]   and so you'll go out and you'll do whatever it takes
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.520]   to be accepted by them,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.400]   and yet it leaves you feeling compromised.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.720]   You see what I'm saying here?
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.120]   Like we know that often when we try to seek satisfaction
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.180]   in the things of this world,
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.640]   it doesn't necessarily move us to a place
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.000]   where we feel great about it.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.420]   But here's the thing, why then do we do it?
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.720]   Because although we don't feel great about it,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.980]   we also don't feel bad enough about it.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:01.120]   You see, in fact, oftentimes when we do this,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.760]   when we satisfy ourselves through sin,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.300]   it still feels good.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.100]   Like if you think about it,
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:14.100]   sin wouldn't really be that useful of an obstacle
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.860]   from the enemy if it didn't evoke some pleasure,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.620]   garner some satisfaction,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.700]   leave you feeling some kind of way.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.220]   You would just look at it and be like, I'm good, thanks.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.700]   Satan doesn't come up to Eve
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.100]   in the very beginning of the Bible
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.620]   with a smoking vial of poison.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.740]   Mm, doesn't this look yummy?
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.900]   That's not what he does.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.380]   He approaches her with what?
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:39.340]   Fruit from the tree that was quote, a delight to the eyes.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.020]   That which looked desirable probably was even enjoyable
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.820]   and yet ultimately was wasteful.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.020]   You see, if you wanna cultivate a hunger for God,
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.460]   then you need to know that pursuing the wrong desire
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.940]   is wasteful.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.820]   Pursuing the wrong desire is wasteful.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.220]   That's why God is appealing to our logic here.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.500]   Like he wants us to reason to the reality
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.740]   that while the things we often seek our happiness
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.160]   and feel good, they're not good.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.820]   Like only in him is there that which is good
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.740]   and rich to the soul.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.660]   That's how James, Jesus' brother,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.620]   recalls it in his first chapter.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.740]   He says, "Every good and perfect gift is from above,
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.460]   "coming down from the Father of lights
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.880]   "with whom there's no variation or shadow due to change."
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.460]   Now you may hear that and think to yourself,
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.060]   Kylan, I get it, man.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.620]   But listen, I'm not openly sinful.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.740]   Like yeah, man, I struggle with pride
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.200]   and I want the acceptance of others,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.100]   but I'm not just like egregiously addicted to something.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.540]   Like it's not like I'm sexually deviant.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.900]   I'm doing pretty good.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.460]   Like I'm not bottling out,
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.100]   I'm not bottoming out at the bottom of a bottle
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.580]   every single weekend.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.460]   That's not who I am.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.700]   And yet here's what I would say,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.500]   though you think you're in the clear,
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.320]   you would be mistaken.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.940]   Satan's greatest scheme isn't to get you
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.820]   focused on the worst thing.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.140]   His greatest scheme is to get you
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.660]   focused off of the best thing.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.700]   That's what he wants to do.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.220]   He doesn't need you to
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:20.540]   get hooked on meth and sell kidneys on the black market.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.700]   Like that's not his goal.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.940]   His goal is to lead you to a place
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.820]   where you find more happiness in your job
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.560]   than you do in Jesus.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.980]   Because then your focus will be more focused on your job
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   and will be on Jesus.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.660]   His goal is to get you to a place
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.620]   where you have deeper happiness in your relationship,
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.500]   that guy, that girl, than you do in Jesus.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.100]   Because as you're more focused on them,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.060]   you will be less focused on him.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.520]   His goal is to get you so happy in your social status
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.040]   that your focus is fully set on your friends
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.380]   and your fans and your followers,
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.780]   more so than it is on Jesus.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:02.300]   You see, this is the danger of Dallas, Texas.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   We are at risk of comfort, materialism, status,
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:15.460]   acceptance, approval.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.960]   And it's not just in our city, it is for our generation.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.300]   Satan would love to lull you to sleep
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.960]   with the meager pleasures of a nice life
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.980]   so that you never awake to the major pleasure
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.260]   of a godly life.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.960]   He wants to keep you asleep.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.240]   He doesn't need to drown you out.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.980]   He just needs to quiet you down.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:48.540]   John Piper said this in his book, "Hunger for God."
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.620]   "The greatest enemy of hunger for God
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.560]   "is not poison, but apple pie.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.240]   "It is not the banquet of the wicked
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.620]   "that dulls our appetite for heaven,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.120]   "but endless nibbling at the table of the world."
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.640]   That's not the X-rated video,
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.860]   but the prime time dribble of triviality
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.120]   that we drink in every night.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.580]   The greatest adversary of love to God
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.580]   is not his enemies, but his gifts.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.260]   And the most deadly appetites are not for the poison of evil
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.580]   but for the simple pleasures of earth.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.960]   For when these replace an appetite for God himself,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.840]   the idolatry is scarcely recognizable and almost incurable.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.160]   That's why God is trying to reason with you here.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.640]   He knows you're already well acquainted
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.560]   with the dissatisfaction this world actually has to offer.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.740]   He just wants you to wake up to the realization
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.120]   that you deserve more than dissatisfaction,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.300]   for he has come to give you more in Christ himself.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.120]   That's why he continues as he moves into verse three.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.960]   He says, "Incline your ear and come to me.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.400]   "Hear that your soul may live,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.560]   "and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.380]   "my steadfast, sure love for David."
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.260]   Like notice throughout this passage
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.440]   that God doesn't dismiss our desire.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.620]   He doesn't belittle the fact that we want for happiness,
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   that we long for some kind of fulfillment,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.140]   that we seek after satisfaction.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.860]   He just tells us where those things are found.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.140]   He says, "They're found in me,"
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.620]   which is why we have to cultivate a greater hunger for God
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.660]   because Jesus is the only one worthy of wanting.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.900]   He's the only one worthy of wanting.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.140]   Like it's interesting.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.420]   After bringing us to a place where we've already answered
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.260]   why we seek after that which will not satisfy,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.880]   he moves us to a place where he answers why
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.880]   or where we can seek that which will satisfy,
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.500]   which is in him.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.180]   He says, "Seek me that your soul may live."
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.580]   Now to be abundantly clear,
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.100]   that's certainly talking about salvation,
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.220]   but it's also talking about so much more.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.780]   Like the promise that your soul may live
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.660]   is not just so you can get eternal life one day,
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.980]   but so that you can have fullness of life right now.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.700]   Like that's what he's trying to pull you into.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.780]   And yet as I was thinking through that,
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.380]   I cannot help but wonder in a room this size,
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.220]   how many of us actually think we're already living?
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:09.460]   Like you got the great job,
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.940]   the fancy position.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.700]   You've got someone that loves you.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.660]   You've got a million followers that want to be like you.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.980]   You're the object of all of your friends' envy.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.260]   You've got time every single weekend to get out there
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.380]   and play golf with the boys.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.940]   And you've really dialed in your swing.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.540]   You've found the perfect place to live
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.240]   and the perfect people to live with.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.820]   Like life according to you
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.620]   is everything that it should look like.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.980]   You have actually found that,
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.700]   which will bring your soul to life.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.020]   But if you actually drill down
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.980]   and you look deep within yourself
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.580]   into the inner recesses of who you are at a soul level,
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.180]   I would reckon, nay, I would actually wager
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.660]   that many of us are sitting here thinking to myself,
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.300]   is this all there is?
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.420]   Is this it?
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.820]   No, there's more.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.500]   There is more on the table for you.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.940]   Like the beauty of revival is this idea
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   that Jesus has actually come to set you free
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.300]   to a life that is so much bigger than we often settle for.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   He's just trying to wake us up so we actually realize it.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.540]   He wants to bring you to a place
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.380]   where you know there is one worthy of wanting
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.660]   that surpasses everything else I've ever wanted.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.860]   Psalm 63, three says,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.940]   "Because your steadfast love is better than life,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.500]   "my lips will praise you."
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.520]   You see, there's one that you can have
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.620]   which will not cost you,
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.500]   one you can have which will never fail you,
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.020]   one you can have that will satisfy you forever.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.820]   He has come that your soul can live.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.940]   The question is, will you come to him
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.020]   so your soul might?
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:57.460]   Just a couple of weeks ago, not even two full weeks,
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.940]   2.1 million people gathered on Copacabana Beach
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.060]   in Rio de Janeiro for a Free Lady Gaga concert.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.740]   Y'all heard about this?
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.300]   The pictures are insane to look at
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.700]   because it is a crowd the likes of which
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.020]   I could never imagine myself being numbered,
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.780]   not because I don't like her music,
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.940]   but because it is insanely crowded.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.540]   Like, can you think about what it took
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.220]   to be a part of these photos?
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.380]   Massive inconvenience,
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.740]   people waking up at the crack of dawn to get a good seat,
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.100]   though the concert would not begin
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.500]   until 10 p.m. later that night.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.640]   2.1 million people, twice the size of Dallas, Texas,
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.240]   showed up for this thing.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.900]   One spectator recalling the event,
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.300]   remembered it as religious.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.900]   What would compel people to do this,
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.620]   to suffer the inconvenience, to fight the massive crowd,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.340]   to endure all the problems
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.300]   you know this had to have produced?
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:04.540]   They saw one worthy of wanting.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.700]   As I was reading the article,
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.900]   trying to understand what could compel people to this place,
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   what was remembered about this crowd
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   is they cried together.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.220]   She came, she came, she came,
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.740]   talking about Lady Gaga.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.180]   You see, they came because she came.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:38.140]   Friends, how convicting is it for us
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.420]   that we have one so much worthy of wanting
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.900]   that has in fact come,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.140]   yet we will not come to him?
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.140]   Jesus is so worthy, so deserving of our desire.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:55.820]   And the beauty of him
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.020]   is that he has produced no cost to come near.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.100]   Like in fact, he has removed the cost
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.780]   by bearing it in himself,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.100]   by dying your death upon the cross.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.340]   Like there's no waiting to be done.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.100]   You don't have to wake up and stay late.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.500]   No, you can have him right now in this room,
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.620]   in this moment, here today.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.860]   And there's no inconvenience to be his.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.260]   That greatest inconvenience
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.500]   that stood in the way of you belonging to Jesus,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.820]   he has removed.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.340]   And to call it an inconvenience
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.820]   is to grossly underestimate what it was,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.700]   because it was sin.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.500]   It was a massive blasphemy against the God of the universe,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.380]   a perfect, holy, and right God that said,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.860]   "We don't want you, we want ourselves."
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.660]   And yet what he did is he removed that inconvenience
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.540]   from his presence by bearing the full weight of it
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.980]   in his own death,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.900]   so that way you would never feel inconvenienced
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.820]   to be near to him.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.620]   You can be near to him right now.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.700]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.020]   Golly, this is something that I just have been begging God.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.460]   Like I want us to wake up to the reality
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.140]   that this is all real.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.220]   Like that's why I yell at you every single Tuesday,
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.140]   because I just want you to get it.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   There is something realer than reality in this space,
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.780]   and it's God.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.300]   He is not distant.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.340]   He is not dormant.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.500]   He is not dead.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   He is not a concept to study
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.820]   or something to intellectually fascinate about.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.300]   He is not one to emotionally feel good over
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.820]   and solely feel good over.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.180]   No, he is one to experience,
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.300]   to engage with, to encounter.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:46.580]   And the way you find that is you hunger for more of him.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.100]   You are a creature of desire.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.540]   He is the fulfiller of your desire.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.540]   We often desire that which is wasteful,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.220]   but he desires that which is worthwhile
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.900]   to be with you forever.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.700]   And we, my dear friends, are so unworthy of wanting,
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.980]   but he, the only one worthy of wanting,
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.420]   he wants you.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.020]   Do you want him?
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:24.020]   Cultivate your hunger and have him beginning tonight.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.700]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.380]   Father, we love you.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.380]   We wanna be with you.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.180]   I just, God, in my sincerity,
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.940]   as I was sitting in service earlier tonight,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.340]   I'm just looking for you.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.580]   I'm just wanting for you.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.380]   I'm trusting God, the plan we've created.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.260]   I'm believing God and the program we've crafted,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.620]   but Lord, this whole room,
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.060]   all these people in what we do,
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.660]   now it is yours.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.140]   We follow you.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.300]   That means, God, we sing all night.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.140]   We'll sing all night.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.020]   That means we pray until we lose our voices.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.620]   We will pray until we lose our voices.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.060]   That means, God, we must confess that final 1%,
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.780]   the very thing that we have held on for so very long, God,
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.740]   that we will do it.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.460]   We want to go where it is you are
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.620]   because it is you, Jesus, that we want.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.660]   We don't want from you.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.300]   We want more of you.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.940]   We want more of you.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.860]   And so we wanna sing to you now
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.100]   in an honest declaration that that is true.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.180]   Some of us, we need to sing until we believe,
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.460]   and we gotta sing until we start singing.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.380]   Some of us, we need to pray until we start praying.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.820]   We've gotta get ourselves to a place where we believe,
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.740]   and often we have to believe
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.540]   until we start believing, God.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.300]   We must labor.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.060]   We must seek.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.500]   We must strive.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.780]   We must desire because you are worthy.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.780]   And it's to you we pray right now.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.780]   In Jesus' name, amen.
