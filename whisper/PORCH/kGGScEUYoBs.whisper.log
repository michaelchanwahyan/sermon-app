[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.980]   Let me just start by telling you
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.340]   how the porch is set up a little bit.
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.500]   And so we have about 250 volunteers
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.140]   that make this happen every week.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.740]   And so as we gather with those 250 volunteers,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.260]   they're divided up on about five teams.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.100]   Those five teams have a male and female leader
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.340]   over each one of those teams.
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.060]   And so those are our porch leaders,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.140]   kind of the elders of the porch, if you will.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.620]   And so every year we get away with those porch leaders.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.540]   We go out of town, we go on a retreat,
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.860]   usually to a lake house.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.940]   A couple of years ago,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.460]   we went to my in-laws lake house on Lake Whitney.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220]   And so we went out there to Lake Whitney.
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.460]   And what this looks like is,
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.260]   is usually a lot of praying, a lot of dreaming,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.620]   asking God what he wants from the ministry,
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.520]   how we can best minister to you guys.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.620]   Those kinds of things.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.260]   And at night we're usually sitting around a campfire.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.980]   And so we're sitting around a campfire,
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.660]   the guys and the girls, and we're talking.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.980]   And there's this big field out there, okay,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.060]   where my in-laws place is.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.980]   There's this big field, some public land, if you will.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.700]   And I asked the leaders, I just said,
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.160]   "Hey, have any of you never been snipe hunting?"
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.860]   And about half of them raised their hand.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.700]   They had never been.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.980]   And so let me just ask you guys,
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.340]   how many of you have never been,
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.600]   or you don't know what snipe hunting is?
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   Would you just raise your hands real high?
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.960]   Okay, so that's a lot of you, okay?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.800]   That's a lot of you.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.680]   So come back with me.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.400]   If you have been snipe hunting, or you know what it is,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.680]   would you raise your hands real high?
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.480]   Okay, so that's some of you too.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.380]   So a little more than half on that first one.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.760]   And so this is kind of what was there.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.320]   It was like half of us had been, half of us hadn't been.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.880]   And I'm like, "Guys, we gotta go.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   "We gotta go snipe hunting."
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.340]   Like, it's gonna be so much fun.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.040]   And everybody that's been, like, "Yes, it's so fun."
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.720]   You know, and so here's the thing.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600]   I know, don't tell them, I know, I know.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.500]   And so here's the deal.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.280]   We go out there, and I'm explaining to them.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.880]   So a snipe, if you don't know what it is,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.760]   it's like this little white bird,
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.760]   and it runs on the ground.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.320]   It comes out at night, kind of like a,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.480]   runs on the ground like a quail, if you will.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.500]   And it comes out at night, and you can catch them.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.160]   They're actually pretty easy to catch.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280]   And so the way that you do it is you get this headlamp,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.520]   you know, 'cause the light,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   they're attracted to the light,
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.400]   and you get a little bag, like a burlap sack,
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.960]   and you have to be out there all by yourself in the field.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.920]   It's the only way to catch them,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.120]   and you have to call them.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   And so the call is irresistible to the snipe.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.300]   And so my friend, Chantal, she's out there.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.320]   She's like a legend with our porch leaders, you know.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   And I'm telling Chantal, I'm like,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   "This is how you catch a snipe."
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   And she's out there in the field.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000]   So I teach her the call.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.080]   I'm gonna teach you guys the call so you can use it.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.320]   And so you go, I mean, like, you go out there,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.520]   and you go, "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!"
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760]   And you got this headlamp, and it's pitch black.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.040]   And so she's out there, you know,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   and so we leave, and she's out there in the field.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.400]   "Ooga-loo-ga-loo-ga-loo!"
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200]   She's holding the bag.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   "Come on, little snipe."
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320]   And we kind of drive around the corner.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   Those of us who had been, we drive around the corner, right?
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   And there's like this big shed there.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.680]   And we drive around the corner,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.780]   and we're just watching and laughing.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.400]   Because here's the deal, right?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.320]   And this is what they don't want me to tell you.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.240]   Snipe aren't real.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.800]   There's no such thing.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.760]   There's no such thing.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600]   And so I know, and, you know,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.440]   and so it's funny, right,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.920]   when you're looking for something that's not real.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680]   And it's even a little entertaining
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.520]   if the way that you're looking is foolish.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.320]   And so many of you came in here this evening
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.240]   in search of love.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.880]   Everyone wants love, and I have to break it to you
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   just like I did for friends about this silly animal.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.640]   The love that you're looking for, it's not real.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.740]   It doesn't exist.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.840]   You've defined it incorrectly.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.080]   And furthermore, for so many of you,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.840]   the way that you're looking is foolish.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   It's foolish.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   And I think the enemy is laughing at you,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   watching you hurt yourself and bring pain into your life,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   remaining single, having unsatisfied desires.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.040]   He's watching you and he's laughing at you.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.640]   And so I want to, from the scriptures tonight,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.240]   show you that it's not real,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.000]   that to find love, you have to,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   to find love, you have to define it in the right way.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   See, actually, it turns out,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.420]   I did a little Google search on the snipe hunt.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.640]   It turns out there is a real bird called a snipe.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.400]   And so this has been a long time, since the 1930s,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.560]   this has been a prank that people pull.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.120]   And so here's a picture of a snipe, right?
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.160]   It looks nothing like I described.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.640]   It turns out it's nowhere near where we were looking.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.800]   It lives near the beach and the sand on the shores there.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.720]   And the way you catch it certainly isn't with a bag
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   and a flashlight and a silly call.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.600]   To find a snipe, you'd one, want to know what it looks like,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   and two, you'd want to know where it is,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.480]   and then three, you'd want to know how to find it,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.040]   or how to attract it, how to catch it.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.680]   And so in the same way, we can make this so simple.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.200]   You're searching for love.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.800]   To find love, you have to know what it is,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.280]   you have to know where you find it,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.680]   and then you have to know how to look.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.760]   Like if we can just solve those three mysteries,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.000]   that's gonna send you out of this place
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.460]   with such a major upper hand than you came in here with.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.800]   You're gonna be so much better off
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   if you know what it looks like and where to find it
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.840]   than when you came in here,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.440]   or when you started listening this evening.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.880]   And so we're talking about finding real love.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.060]   We're in this series called Fantasy.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.520]   The subtitle is Finding Real Love in a Fake World.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.640]   And you might say, well, what do they mean by a fake world?
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.920]   A fake world is what has defined love for you
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.820]   before you came in here.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.340]   It's social media, right?
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.060]   It's the highlight reel of everybody else's life.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.180]   It's the airbrushed images in magazines, they're not real.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.260]   It's the movies and the TV shows
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.640]   that are painting the picture of, hey, this is love,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.080]   yet it doesn't last, it never lasts,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.320]   and yet that's where you have gone
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.420]   to be educated on such topics.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.240]   It's the dating profiles and getting catfished
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.560]   and tender out there, swiping right or left.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   This is not going to lead you to biblical,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.960]   sustaining, sacrificial love.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.640]   It's going to lead you exactly where you've been before,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.380]   like a dog to his vomit, hurt.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.340]   Crying in the middle of the night, sad, going back to check.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.860]   Has he texted me, has she texted?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.100]   Wonder why, wonder what they're doing,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.260]   wonder where they're at.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.440]   Lost, confused, crying out.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.500]   And I want something better for you.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.140]   I believe your Father in heaven
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.100]   wants something better for you.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.180]   And so I want you to look for something that's real.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.780]   I want you to look in the right place.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.800]   I don't want the way that you're looking to be silly,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   like you're standing in a field making some silly sound
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.440]   with an enemy laughing at you.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.900]   As we think about love, as you defined it
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.780]   when you came in here, let me just ask the question,
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.140]   is it even necessary?
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.200]   I'll read to you two statistics.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.680]   These come from Aziz Ansari's book, Modern Romance.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.580]   The first one just says,
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.860]   "Waiting for true love was a luxury
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.300]   "that many, especially women, could not afford.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.900]   "In the early 1960s, a full 76% of women
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.560]   "admitted that they would be willing
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.140]   "to marry someone they didn't love."
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.420]   The vast majority of people said
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.700]   they would be willing to marry someone
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.620]   that they didn't feel romantic love towards.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.240]   Crazy, crazy, right?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.620]   And then it says, "Then the generation that came of age
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.700]   "during the '60s and '70s rejected companionate marriage
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.260]   "and began to pursue something greater.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.520]   "They didn't merely want a spouse, they wanted a soulmate.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.880]   "By the 1980s, 86% of American men
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.140]   "and 91% of American women said
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.540]   "they would not marry someone
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.540]   "without the presence of romantic love."
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.660]   So one generation, you have, say, the vast majority say,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.820]   "No, romantic love's not necessary."
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.000]   And then in one generation later,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.140]   you have the vast majority of Americans saying,
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.940]   "I wouldn't even consider marrying someone
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.980]   "without romantic love."
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.860]   My hunch is you are firmly in that second camp, right?
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.740]   What happened between the generation that existed
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.940]   in the '60s and the '70s and '80s?
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.500]   What happened in between there?
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.540]   Something called the sexual revolution.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.340]   We thought we got so much smarter when it came to sex.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.160]   You had the invention of birth control.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.260]   You had the invention of Playboy magazine.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.460]   You have, the very wave was created
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.700]   that we're still coasting on today.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.260]   And we think we're better at it with all of our new,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.880]   like we're like, "Of course I wouldn't get married in love."
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.180]   Let me ask you guys a question by raising my hand,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.020]   by show of hands.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.460]   How many campuses, you can participate as well,
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.460]   how many of your grandparents were divorced?
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.860]   Would you raise your hand if your grandparents were divorced?
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.260]   Now, not if they were widowed and they remarried,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.900]   but if they actually got a divorce.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.320]   Would you raise your hands? I wanna see them.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.220]   Okay, okay, got it.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.620]   How many of your parents are divorced?
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.360]   Wow, wow.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.200]   Okay, can I tell you something too?
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.900]   You have twice as many grandparents as you do parents.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:28.800]   So in theory, that first question
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.720]   should have been twice as many hands,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.680]   but it was much less than half as many hands.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.140]   Are we getting better at this?
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.480]   And you can answer this for yourself
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.060]   if what your grandparents had is true love or real love
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.320]   or more real love than what your parents have
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.160]   if you know them.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:56.800]   And so I'm gonna be jumping around more topical
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.120]   this evening, but there's one verse
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.080]   I wanna look at up front.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.840]   It's Romans 12 verse nine.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.400]   And it says, "Love must be sincere.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.600]   "Hate what is evil, cling to what is good."
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.520]   Very simple verse.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.340]   You can look at me.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.320]   "Love must be sincere.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.660]   "Hate what is evil, cling to what is good."
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.240]   To say that, like love must not be fantasy.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.560]   Love must not be fake.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   Love must be real and true and honest and authentic.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.400]   Love, if it's real love, it has to be sincere.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.840]   And I think the problem is we have not hated what is evil.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.880]   We've clung to what is evil and we've hated what is good
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.080]   and we've settled for a fake love.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.000]   We've settled for an insincere love.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.020]   And so as I move through this,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.240]   we're gonna look at what is fake love,
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.480]   what is real love, and how to find it.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.320]   And let's just start with what is fake love.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.380]   What is fake love?
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.800]   So many people find fake love
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.200]   because you have no idea what you're looking for.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Right?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.320]   You're just out there and you're trying to find something,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.040]   but you don't know what it looks like.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.440]   How can you find something that you don't know what it looks,
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.360]   and you hear this phrase, right?
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.760]   People try to help you with this phrase.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.300]   Well, you just know when you know.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.920]   Isn't that so helpful?
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.800]   You just know when you know.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   Or you could know when you find what it is
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.140]   that you set out looking for.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.360]   Wouldn't that be a better plan?
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.520]   See, like just this, it was yesterday actually,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.760]   my friend texted me and was like,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.480]   hey, I'm gonna go to the Allen Outlet Mall.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.360]   Do you wanna go with me?
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.640]   I'm like, of course, I wanna go with you.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.480]   And I like to shop.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.120]   And so he picks me up and I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   He's like, well, you know, I'm looking for a rain jacket
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.920]   'cause it's been raining for like seven months here.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   And so he's like, I'm looking for a rain jacket.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.880]   My rain jacket got a hole in it
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.240]   and so I was gonna go to the North Face Outlet.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.480]   And I said, great, I'd love to go with you.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.600]   And so it was interesting, our shopping experiences,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.680]   because I wasn't really looking for anything,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.640]   which is to say I was looking at everything,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.120]   just kind of wandering around.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.760]   I'm like, oh man, Zoomies, skateboard.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.000]   I think I need a, oh no, and then over here,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.720]   this coat, jacket, how about this shirt,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.160]   these shoes though, right?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.200]   And so I'm walking around looking all this,
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.820]   but his experience is so different.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.400]   He's like, rain coat, okay, do they have this?
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.120]   And this side, okay, rain, okay, North Face,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.680]   I'm gonna go check out Columbia.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520]   And then he goes to Columbia
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.200]   and just goes to the rain coat racks.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.160]   Like he's on a mission, he's focused,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.200]   he knows exactly what he's looking for.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.080]   Meanwhile, I'm just running around,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.200]   wandering around with a little bit of money in my pocket,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.060]   thinking, hey, I don't know what I'm gonna take home.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.120]   You know, and that's how some of you date.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.800]   Right?
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.880]   Right, I don't know what I'm gonna take home.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.060]   Who I'm gonna take home.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.080]   Or who I'm gonna go home with.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.720]   I know it's so simple, and I'm sorry,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.580]   I know a lot of you missed it.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.760]   What if right now you just said,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.260]   hey, I'm gonna look for exactly this,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.300]   and I'm not gonna settle until I find that?
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:16.500]   What if you left here with that reality, with that idea?
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.200]   See, we're getting married later.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.160]   We're training for divorce, jumping into a relationship,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.880]   jumping out, jumping in, jumping out.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.440]   As soon as something goes wrong, jump out.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.080]   That's not training for marriage.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.080]   We're not getting married at all.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   More than any other generation before us.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.400]   And I think we have to ask the question, why?
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.500]   And so what is fake love?
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.600]   Fake love is defined by fake sources.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.000]   Fake love is defined by fake sources.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.620]   Fantasy begets fantasy.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.800]   If your teacher is fake, then your results are fake.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.520]   If what they've taught you is fake,
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.720]   then what you're looking for is fake.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.600]   And so you have to ask the question,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   what defines love for you?
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.560]   Do you want what your parents have?
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.280]   Do you want what your grandparents have?
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.640]   Do you want what Kim and Kanye have?
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.240]   What is it that you're actually looking for?
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.000]   Who's defined that for you?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.640]   Do you want what Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have?
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.760]   Or Ariana and Pete had?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.180]   What are you looking for?
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.780]   And what's crazy is it's not even
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.500]   the celebrity relationships you're looking for,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.780]   it's the relationships that they have on a show
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.060]   where they're playing a part,
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.020]   that's what you're looking for.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.460]   I want what I saw on the notebook.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.260]   I mean, really, that's confusing.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.980]   I mean, which one, right?
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.560]   You really have been taught this by people
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.520]   who are playing a part from a script,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.120]   acting for money, and you say, that's what I want.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.080]   I want what the 27 failed bachelor or bachelorettes want.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.620]   Really, that's confusing.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   That's what you want.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:24.500]   That's confusing.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.880]   What's defining your source of love
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.100]   that will help you know if it's fake?
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.180]   See, biblical love is sacrificial.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.280]   It's not self-serving, right?
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   It's not something that reality shows would be made of.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.560]   See, you've been fed this lie of the man at Kais
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.360]   and the man at Klos, and in a really strange way,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.740]   because we've met and we've talked, me and you,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.440]   you want something that's incredibly broken.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.900]   And you say, no, I don't want something that's broken,
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.800]   but in here, you're like, no, I kinda do.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.340]   I kinda want him one minute to tell me he loves me
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.660]   and the next minute to tell me he hates me.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.400]   I want him to bring me close and then throw things at me.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.700]   No, I would never want that.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.800]   Yes, you do, because that's what you've been entertained by.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.220]   And in a really weird, twisted, broken way,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.980]   somewhere inside of you, that's what you want.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.060]   And I hate, the enemy's laughing at you
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.940]   in a field holding a bag with a flashlight
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.360]   making crazy sounds.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.860]   He's laughing at you.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:36.300]   And God wants something better for you than that.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.660]   But they won't make any movies about it.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.420]   Like when a man loves a woman
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.620]   and he gives himself for her,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.420]   and a woman loves a man and she gives herself for him,
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.680]   you know what it is?
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.480]   Like, can I just be honest with you?
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.300]   You're gonna think I'm crazy on this.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.440]   I'm gonna lose all credibility with you.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.660]   Try to listen after I say this, okay?
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.680]   You're gonna have to try.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.660]   It's boring.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.160]   That's the truth.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.360]   It's not entertaining.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.460]   It's just, it's amazing, it's beautiful, it's sacrificial,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.860]   it's incredible, it's godly.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.980]   But honestly, you really, what you want,
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.200]   you want a boring marriage.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.420]   A marriage that no director or producer's calling you
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.140]   saying, hey man, can we come over and film?
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.340]   Because that was, I heard you from three blocks away
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.380]   yelling at each other.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.780]   No, no, you don't want that.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.140]   You want, no, I didn't hear you,
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.220]   I've never heard you guys yell or even raise your tone
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.660]   or anything, it just seems like you guys love each other.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.780]   That doesn't sell.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.360]   Nobody came in here tonight thinking, man,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.020]   I really want a boring marriage.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:50.740]   But I hope you leave here wanting a boring marriage.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.360]   Fake love is self-serving.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.420]   See, fantasy is all about the pursuit of ecstasy,
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.560]   you know, the fantasy suite or fantasy island, right?
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.060]   That's fake love.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.720]   If you're thinking about what they can do for you
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.520]   or what you can do to them, that's fake love.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.360]   And so we think about sex all the time.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.500]   This is a big felt need you came in here with.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.180]   You want to have sex, you want to experience intimacy.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.980]   And I get that, I've been there, okay?
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.980]   I have had all of the bad expectations that you guys have.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.500]   Like I thought marriage, I was like,
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.960]   man, you just have sex all the time.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.940]   Like that's what it is.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.220]   I mean, I thought that.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.780]   I'm like, she's gonna wear lingerie every single night.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.460]   Just like I've seen in the Victoria's Secret magazines,
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.960]   you know, before I was a believer.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.620]   Like that's what she's gonna do
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.840]   because that looks comfortable, right?
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.380]   I'm sure that's what she wants to do.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.180]   And so, and then you get married.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.020]   And can I tell you something?
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.800]   It's not like that.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.580]   And I know, here's what you just thought
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.580]   'cause I heard it, it was so loud.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.080]   That's just you, JP.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.460]   Okay, can I tell you something?
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:07.460]   I spent the last 12 years meeting with hundreds of women
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.860]   and hundreds, maybe thousands of couples.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.900]   I've seen the ones that are really successful.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.060]   I've seen the ones that have failed.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.320]   People will talk with a pastor about very intimate issues.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.120]   It's the reality.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.460]   It's not going to be what you think.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.060]   Marriage is not one big hookup session.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.040]   It just isn't.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.540]   In fact, I'll come behind that with some data.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.220]   My friend's a CPA and so he did a little research for me.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.340]   And it's couples that have a lot of sex,
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.420]   couples that have a lot of sex,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.420]   they have 3,240 minutes of sex a year.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.580]   That's a lot, 3,240 minutes.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.660]   That's a lot, right?
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.500]   Okay.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.300]   I was gonna make a joke, but I'm not, okay?
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   The Holy Spirit interceded there and saved you all.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.360]   Thank God for that.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.420]   There are 526,600 minutes each year.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:14.420]   That means that this couple who has 3,240 minutes of sex,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.220]   they spend less than 1% of their time having sex.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.180]   In fact, it's 0.62%.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.220]   Here's what that means.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.020]   Is a couple who has lots of sex
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   spends 99.38% of their time doing not sex.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.260]   Everything else.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.140]   Like I'm just gonna go with you for a minute.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.900]   Maybe I shouldn't, but I think my wife and I
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.460]   are better than average.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.860]   And I'm just shooting you straight.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.540]   And here's the deal.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.100]   We spend a lot of time, like okay,
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.700]   can you take him to that soccer game?
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.460]   No, I got this soccer practice over here.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.300]   Okay, you go over there.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.300]   No, I'm actually speaking over here.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.900]   Okay, I'll see you Thursday.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.420]   All right, maybe Thursday, okay.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.420]   And then, and so you go here.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.660]   Okay, grocery store, okay.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.940]   And then dinner, is it, okay.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.020]   No, I'm gonna eat, okay.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.700]   I got the, oh, it's Tuesday.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.700]   I have the porch, actually.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.860]   I'll be there till about 10.30, okay?
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.300]   You see, that's real life.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:28.260]   That's what it, and so if she was just great at intimacy,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.140]   then that means she potentially would not be great
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.140]   at 99 point most of marriage.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:44.700]   Make sure you're looking for what matters.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.380]   And it's not sex.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.860]   As my friend says wisely, you don't even wanna have sex.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.420]   You wanna experience godly intimacy.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.460]   And that's available for people who know
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.620]   what godly love is, and it's available exclusively for them
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.060]   and not anybody else.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:08.260]   In fact, where the scripture talks about marriage,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.660]   in 1 Peter 3, Colossians 3, or Ephesians 5,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.780]   it tells you, hey, this is how to be married well.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.140]   Nowhere does it say, and here's how you be a better lover,
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.020]   or here's some tips and tricks.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.320]   It's all about, hey, you lay your life down as Christ did,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.540]   sacrificial service, strive to live in an understanding way.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.740]   These are from those verses.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.180]   The verses that are about marriage,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.540]   they don't say anything about improving your intimacy,
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.300]   but improving your service to one another.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.740]   Even intimacy is not about receiving.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.580]   It's not about you experiencing pleasure,
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.940]   but it's about serving in the scripture.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.580]   And so fake love is rooted in how they make you feel.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.380]   If you're going about thinking about
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.880]   how they make you feel, right?
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.180]   This is fake love.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.820]   I do weddings every now and then,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.060]   and every couple I marry, I ask this question,
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.100]   hey, why do you love him?
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.260]   Why do you love her?
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.300]   And there's this pattern in their response.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.540]   Sometimes they'll say, well,
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.500]   I love the way he makes me feel.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.700]   And I just call them out on that,
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.480]   'cause I'm like, man, that's incredibly selfish.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.740]   What you love about him is about you.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   What you love about her is about you.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.180]   Like, that's what you're chasing
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.520]   is how someone can make you feel.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.160]   What about when they can't make you feel that way anymore?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.280]   Right?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.180]   Love is serving.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.160]   It's giving.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.360]   It's sharing.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.020]   Man, and so what you love about them
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.120]   is how they make you feel.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.620]   If we're chasing someone to make us feel a certain way,
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.020]   and this is, this is,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.320]   so what so many of you came in here thinking,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.260]   and it's not your fault.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.100]   That's the truth.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.140]   It's not your fault.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.260]   You've been fed this lie, man.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.320]   This is the lie that they're feeding you slowly
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.620]   and meticulously and strategically.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.980]   The people who are really bad at love
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.340]   are coming alongside you saying,
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.580]   hey, let me coach you up.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.900]   Let me teach you what love is.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.980]   Love is like a drug.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.300]   This is the popular message.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   In fact, let me just show you something crazy.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.600]   We're coming out of our lyrics and lies series.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.360]   And so just as a little overlap tonight,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.160]   let me read to you some lyrics, which is always awkward.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.220]   And so let me just,
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.580]   this is, these are the songs you're listening to, okay?
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.580]   The big idea, love is a drug you use, okay?
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.440]   And so Camila Cabello, she says this.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.080]   Something must have gone wrong in my brain.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.260]   Got your chemicals all in my veins.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.640]   Feeling all the highs, feel all the pain.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.480]   Let go of the wheel, it's borderline.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.680]   Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.960]   Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me,
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.400]   just like nicotine.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.180]   Rushing me, touching me.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.680]   Suddenly I'm a fiend and you're all I need.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   You're to blame, just one hit of you,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.480]   I knew I'll never be the same.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.880]   Kesha just says it outright.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.600]   Your love is my drug.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.340]   It's the name of her song.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.640]   Justin Timberlake's Push Your Love Girl says this.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.240]   Tell me, can I get a light, roll you up,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.920]   and let it run through my veins?
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.680]   'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.120]   I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.960]   Now you got me hopped up on that push your love,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.920]   so high I'm on the ceiling, baby.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:28.400]   We'll go Camila again with Machine Gun Kelly.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.760]   She says, and we're both wild and the night's young
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.960]   and you're my drug.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.440]   Breathe you in 'til my face is numb.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.720]   Which reminds me of another one.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   I can't feel my face when I'm with you.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.600]   And so The Weeknd, right?
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.840]   That's what the song is all about.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.020]   You're a drug, I wanna use you.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.000]   Even Fifth Harmony got in on this, man.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.700]   Fifth Harmony, say it ain't so.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.840]   I'm like that drug, drug, drug.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.820]   He trip when he on it.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.740]   One taste and he want it.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.720]   This just in, okay?
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.240]   Public service announcement.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.680]   Love is not a drug.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.280]   You don't use it to get high.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.520]   You don't use people.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.720]   Dating is not a drug.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.400]   And if you have bought into that lie,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.160]   if you're chasing the next high, chasing the next feeling,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.880]   it's also gonna come with the hurt and the hangover,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.680]   the withdraw, if you will.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.040]   When you begin to try to learn how to do it right,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.280]   it's going to be painful 'cause all you know
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.980]   is what's wrong and you're hooked on it.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.840]   You're addicted.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.640]   What happens with drugs?
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.720]   What do we do with drugs?
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.520]   We use drugs, we get addicted to drugs,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.900]   and we get hurt by drugs.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.640]   And what happens with the way that you date?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.080]   You use people, you get addicted to people,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.300]   and then you get hurt by people.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.440]   And I know that as you look in your rear view mirror,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.040]   I just described a lot of your dating lives.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.960]   And the enemy's laughing at you while you're in a field
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.400]   making silly noises with a bag and a flashlight.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.660]   And your heavenly Father, He never, ever meant
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.920]   for you to experience the heartache and the pain
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.760]   that you've experienced.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.440]   He didn't want that for you.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.880]   And you're mad at Him.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.680]   Why did He let me date Him?
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.400]   He didn't want you to.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.700]   You didn't ask Him.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.560]   You never asked Him.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.880]   And then when you did, you did the things
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.680]   He asked you not to.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.360]   And you're mad at Him.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   That's insanity.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.660]   That's insanity.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.920]   I'm not gonna listen to a word you said.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.360]   I'm not gonna do it your way.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.460]   I'm gonna do it my way.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.420]   But when it goes south, you're to blame.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.520]   Are you sure?
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:12.600]   Love is a verb.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.720]   And so if you're looking for it,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.220]   look for people who live out the verb, who serve.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.080]   Someone who enjoys serving others.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.360]   My wife and I were watching this movie on VidAngel.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.520]   If you don't know what VidAngel is, find out.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.880]   And so we're watching the breakup on VidAngel.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.640]   And there's this scene, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.720]   It's so intense.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.840]   They're in this fight.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.680]   So intense.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.920]   And he's like, "You want me to do the dishes?"
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.280]   And she's like, "No, I want you to wanna do the dishes."
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.680]   And he's like, "Who wants to do the dishes?"
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.920]   And I would just say, people who love serving.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.080]   People who love serving want to do the dishes.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.640]   That's what you're looking for.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.880]   Someone who loves serving others.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.000]   And so what is real love?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.960]   It's this.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.800]   I'm gonna read it to you.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.360]   This is real love.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   It's straight from the Bible.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.320]   It's so clear.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.720]   It's like God loves us so much.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.840]   And so close your eyes as I read this to you.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.660]   Let me just read it.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.520]   You just picture it.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.840]   You see it if you will.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.640]   Love is patient.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.020]   Love is kind.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.840]   It does not envy.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.940]   It does not boast.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.280]   It is not proud.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.080]   It does not dishonor others.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.720]   It is not self-seeking.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.880]   It is not easily angered.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.840]   It keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.400]   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.920]   It always protects, always trusts,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:56.000]   always hopes, always perseveres.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.680]   Love never fails.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:06.260]   Real love is defined as sacrificial service.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.720]   Real love is defined as sacrificial service.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.520]   And so here's the simple assignment for you.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.080]   You can compare what you're looking for to this list.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   This should be your list.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.720]   I want her to be tall and brunette.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.440]   No, no, this is your list.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.760]   I hope he's a doctor.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.160]   No, this is your list.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.420]   It doesn't say doctor.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.320]   It doesn't say that.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.800]   She better be a virgin.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.640]   No, no, no, this.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.240]   This is your list.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.160]   All that other stuff is silly.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.120]   I want you to make sure you could just,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.160]   so you're not tempted to email,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.820]   I wanna be really clear, okay?
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.360]   All that other stuff is silly.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.200]   Is that clear?
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.020]   Like are we clear?
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.860]   Am I clear?
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.680]   Am I being clear as I say?
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.560]   It's silly.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.880]   It's silly.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.240]   This is your list.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.160]   This is what you're looking for.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.120]   So how do you know when you found,
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.280]   it's not you just know when you know.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.400]   You know when, it's this.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.160]   Now I know, it's this.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.080]   Are you saying I can just marry anybody that meets that?
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:16.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.920]   I am crazy.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.200]   I know, crazy.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   Let's keep going.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   Understanding first that you have been loved.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:35.540]   You are loved right now, perfectly.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.700]   I get so sad when I see my single friends,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.280]   both male and female,
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.440]   when they don't find someone or their heart gets hurt,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.640]   they turn from God.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.920]   The one who has said he's never going to leave you
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.680]   or forsake you.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.280]   And you're upset because you're alone.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.080]   And what he wants you to realize is you're not alone.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.960]   You'll never be alone.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.320]   You've never been alone since you've known him.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.580]   And you don't need to be mad at him.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.640]   Okay?
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.320]   He's not the one that brought sin into the world.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.200]   The world we live in is broken
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.640]   and there's heartbreak here.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   The world that you've been reserved for,
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.880]   the world that you were meant for,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.080]   there's no heartbreak there.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.640]   There's no breakups there.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.160]   There's no divorce there.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.120]   How many, and so many of you raised your hands
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.160]   and you, I hate that, I hate that.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.060]   Like my heart hurts when I see that.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.080]   'Cause I know that that didn't come easy, right?
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.460]   To live in that home, to see the things thrown about.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.800]   Maybe it happened after you left
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.840]   and you got the phone call and it's like, what?
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.480]   But you guys promised.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.560]   If you define love as giving of yourself
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   for the good of others, then you can look for that.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.200]   You can look for someone who is constantly giving
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.760]   of themselves for the good of others.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.960]   John 15, 13 says this, "Greater love has no one than this,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.600]   "to lay down one's life for one's friends."
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.120]   And this isn't just a Jesus juke, right?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.640]   This is the reality that God has demonstrated love for us.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.960]   He's the author of love.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.200]   I'm gonna show you in a minute that love comes from him.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.000]   He's the one that invented love.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.560]   He gets to define love.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.300]   If you're not looking for his love,
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.620]   then you're not looking for love.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.440]   What you're looking for is not love if it's not God's love.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.380]   Like God is the author of love.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.000]   Not Hollywood, not the movies,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.520]   not the songs you're listening to,
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.360]   the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.340]   And so he says, "Love is sincere.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.280]   "Real love is sincere."
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.360]   It's Romans 12, nine, I gave it to you up top.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.920]   "Real love is sincere.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.540]   "Love must be sincere."
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.280]   And so guys, what this means
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.700]   is you can just be honest and truthful.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.300]   And you don't have to like text message
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.500]   and hint around or play games
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.620]   or slide into DMs with something crazy.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.780]   Like you can just be honest and speak from your heart.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.800]   And this removes all the complications.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.980]   Imagine if everyone left here and you were just honest
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.100]   and you didn't play games.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.540]   Like what is games?
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.380]   What do I mean by that?
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.860]   You can receive a text message and you see it
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.740]   and you wanna text them back,
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.980]   but you don't because you want them to feel,
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.840]   what, that's love?
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.920]   I mean, really?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.200]   That's what you think the creator wants from you?
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.960]   It is for someone to be sitting
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.160]   on the other end of the phone wondering?
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.200]   Like that's what you thought was going to get you
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.980]   a real solid marriage, one grounded in truth.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.220]   Guys, are you serious?
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.240]   He has better for you than that.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.400]   No need to play games.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   Like so many of us, we've learned to love selfishly.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.880]   In fact, the only question we ask
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.640]   when considering an opportunity is what's in it for me?
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.400]   And to you, I would say serve,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.080]   like get out there and give of yourself
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.280]   because in marriage, you have to do a lot of serving.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.720]   If you don't enjoy doing the dishes,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   you're not going to enjoy marriage, okay?
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.440]   You're gonna be doing the dishes as often
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.600]   or maybe even more than you're going to be making love.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.880]   Think about that for a minute.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.060]   You better like doing the dishes.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:27.000]   Right, my marriage friends are getting whiplash,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.940]   nodding their heads so hard, I see you.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.000]   And the enemy's so good, he makes me so mad,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.920]   he makes me so angry because he keeps those of you
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.880]   that are selflessly serving single
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   and he allows the people that are selfish
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.680]   and stuck on themselves and narcissistic
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.760]   and all concerned about the way they look
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.880]   and he allows them to get married.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.720]   But can I tell you something?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.400]   He allows them to get married five times,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.200]   two times, three times, four times.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.720]   And I promise, I've been doing this for a while.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.680]   The one who's selflessly serving wins.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.900]   They win every time.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.680]   Winning looks different,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.240]   but they're always better off than the selfish one.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.540]   They're always better off.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.280]   Let's don't play games.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.960]   We'll make it complicated, keep it simple.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.920]   If you like someone, tell them you like them.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.820]   If you don't like them, tell them why.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.640]   Be honest.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.960]   Real love is not motivated by fear.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.040]   Real love is not motivated by fear.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.760]   Are you looking for love out of fear
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.360]   or are you not looking for love out of fear?
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.560]   Both are wrong.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.440]   Real love is not motivated by fear.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.560]   First John 4:18 says, "There is no fear in love,
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.120]   "but perfect love drives out fear,"
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.080]   because fear has to do with punishment.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.040]   The one who fears is not made perfect in love, right?
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.800]   And so if you're here and you wanna be married
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.160]   because you're afraid to be alone,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.640]   you don't have to be afraid to be alone.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.200]   Like I said before, you've never been alone.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.720]   And you need to know that your singleness
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.800]   is not a punishment.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.120]   In fact, we did an entire message,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.920]   messages on this reality that singleness is a gift.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.080]   Please go listen to 'em,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.520]   because after I finished that message,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.400]   churches from around the country literally said,
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.280]   "Hey, can you come and give that message here
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.920]   "because we love our single people
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.140]   "and we want them to hear that."
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.040]   The scripture says that singleness is a gift.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.140]   Please go back and listen to that message.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.640]   And here's the truth.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   I gotta tell you the truth about marriage.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.300]   And if you hear me and you believe me,
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.320]   if you don't believe me, that's fine.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   But prove it, you know what I'm saying?
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.040]   Like leave here and test it and wrestle with it
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.860]   and think about it.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.040]   That's what I want to do tonight.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   I almost wanna leave you with questions.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.960]   I want you to begin to question the things
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.120]   that you knew to be true when you came in here.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.280]   Not the gospel, but the things about love
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.880]   and what the world has taught you about love.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.120]   And here's the truth about marriage.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.000]   I love marriage, it's a gift.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.080]   Some of you need to hear that.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.900]   Marriage is good.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.200]   Those of you that are like afraid of it,
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.080]   I want you to know it's really, really good.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.740]   Those of you that can't wait to get married,
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.420]   I want you to hear it's really, really, really hard.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.800]   It's really good and it's really hard.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.460]   Both are true.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.620]   All right, here's the truth about marriage.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.820]   It's much more practical than any of you
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.060]   want to believe it is.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.040]   It's a partnership on life.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.700]   It's like hey, life is hard.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.220]   Like let's go through this together.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.060]   It's not about all the feels.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.940]   Like all the feels aren't gonna be there
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.160]   for a lot of the days that you're married.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:40.440]   We heard in the '60s they weren't there
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   for 76% of people who got married
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.560]   at a time when we even learned in this room
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.160]   that the divorce rate was lower.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.920]   That should challenge your thinking.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.900]   See, here's the reality.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.800]   Once upon a time, like in the '50s and in the '60s,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.660]   the beginning of the '60s, marriage was the foundation
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.380]   of your adult life.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.580]   Here's what this meant is you graduated
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.180]   from high school or college and you looked out
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.920]   and usually you would marry someone
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.820]   within a five block radius of where you lived,
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.840]   which challenges the whole one mentality.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.460]   Like the one was your neighbor, you know,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.520]   right down the street.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.480]   That was the one.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.780]   And so you would get married
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:30.180]   and it was this reality of like man, life is really hard.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.900]   Like I've gotta go to work now, I'm in debt, you know,
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.940]   I need help with these things.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.060]   So let's come together and help each other.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.460]   And it was the foundation and you would build the house
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.540]   on that foundation.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.880]   This is how it used to be.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.980]   Now you feel the pressure.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.740]   When you came in here, you feel the pressure.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.140]   You need to build the house.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.320]   It needs to all be there.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.420]   You need to have the job, make this much money.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.060]   You gotta be able to afford a ring, you know,
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.700]   get out of debt, get everything all polished up.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.000]   And then marriage is the furnishings.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.620]   Once the house is built,
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.500]   I'm gonna put the furniture inside.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.180]   You view marriage like the sofa that you buy
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.100]   after the couch is, sorry, after the house is built.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.180]   It's not that.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.580]   It was never meant to be that.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.400]   What are we doing?
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.500]   We're waiting longer and longer and longer to get married.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.340]   Some of us aren't getting married at all.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.940]   Like if you want marriage,
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.400]   I believe God is a fan of young marriage.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.060]   And if you wanna challenge me on that,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.700]   I would just look at biology.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.400]   When your body begins to prepare itself to procreate,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.200]   and I believe that we obey the laws of the land.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.420]   I believe that, you know,
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.780]   this is an area we've been heavily influenced by culture,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.920]   but I will go on record and believe
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   that God is a fan of young marriage based on his design.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:53.500]   And it's not a capstone.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.080]   It's the cornerstone.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.960]   It's not the furnishings.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.220]   It's the foundation.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:04.840]   And so how do you find real love before we leave?
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.140]   How do you find real love?
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.120]   We do, Monica and I do premarital counseling,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.460]   and we have the couples take this test
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.600]   called the Prepare and Enrich Test.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   And it asks them all these questions.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.880]   And every, I believe this to be true.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.800]   I think every couple that we've met with
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.600]   has missed one of the questions.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.480]   Every one of them, I mean, they miss different questions,
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.440]   but every one of them has missed one question in particular
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.640]   that talks about love and how you define it.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.480]   And it shows us as we look at the results,
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.920]   it says, hey, you need to help this couple
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.880]   with expectations.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.720]   And that's what I believe.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.400]   If I can help you with expectations tonight
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.680]   from the scriptures, if we can look at what love is
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.140]   from the one who invented it,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.720]   then you're gonna leave here better off than you came in.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.680]   That's gonna help you find what it is.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.760]   And so if you know what it looks like and where to find it,
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.560]   you are set up for success, at least more success
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.920]   than you came in here with.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   If love is serving,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.420]   then where you find it is among the servants.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.820]   Like that's where you look for it.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.280]   And here's what's ironic to me is,
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.040]   my friend told me about this term today
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.200]   called missionary goggles.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.080]   Anybody heard of this, missionary goggles?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.920]   I hadn't either.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.680]   And I'm, that's, okay, so some of you.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.640]   Like girls, I'll just talk to you for a second.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.620]   Like you're so concerned with what you look like
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.800]   and the makeup and the hair and all of that
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.840]   and like just making sure everything's in order.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.680]   And that's cool.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.240]   Like God has made you that way.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.820]   And I think that's fantastic.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.560]   But I just, I wanna tell you an observation
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   that my friend said today.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.960]   And I was like, that's so true.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   Is what I see is, we go on these overseas trips,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.480]   we go to a third world country.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.600]   The girl doesn't leave,
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.640]   like she leaves her blow dryer behind, you know?
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.880]   And I mean, we're lucky if she brought deodorant,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.160]   you know, hadn't taken a shower in three days.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.400]   And she's out there serving people
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.160]   on the side of the Amazon River in the Amazon jungle,
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.640]   caring for widows and orphans.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.320]   And some dude is across the way,
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.960]   like man, I never noticed her before.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.300]   Like wow, she's hot.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.880]   Like literally, she's hot, like pit stains and all.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.720]   Like no.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.640]   [congregation laughing]
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.060]   No, I mean, but it's like, and they come back
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.000]   and the relationship takes off.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.840]   Like I've seen that.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.600]   Somebody's on launch retreats the same way.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.520]   I know it's not like serving like that,
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.960]   but you get out there and people,
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.460]   like the sparks don't fly
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.940]   when you're all dolled up for the party.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.040]   It's like when you're all sweaty on the field, you know,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.000]   and everybody's nasty and it's just like,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.240]   but man, we're just running together
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.400]   and we're having fun together
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.240]   and we're experiencing the body of Christ
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.440]   and fellowship together.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.480]   Like, just think about that.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.600]   Like, okay, I may be wrong,
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.240]   but just think about it for a second.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.780]   And so you look among the saints,
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.480]   you look among the servants.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.160]   Second Corinthians 6, 14 says,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.620]   "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers."
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.860]   What does this mean, yoked together with unbelievers?
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.260]   We were on vacation this past weekend
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.340]   and we were in a museum, walking through a museum,
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.020]   and I saw a literal yoke.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.420]   And so a yoke is something that you would use
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.260]   to put oxen in, two oxen.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.220]   And so they would be yoked together
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.620]   and they'd have to go the same direction at the same speed.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.460]   And so I took a picture,
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.000]   here's my daughter and her friend.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.140]   Doesn't he look like just the average married guy?
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.340]   And she looks like the average married girl.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.760]   And I thought that was funny
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.300]   'cause he's like, "Why are you taking a picture of me?"
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.100]   And so this thing right here, this yoke,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.940]   that's what it's saying,
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.260]   don't be yoked together with unbelievers
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.580]   because if someone goes right,
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.860]   like you're going to have to go right with them
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.180]   or you're going to break your neck.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.580]   And in fact, you want to be yoked to someone
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.680]   who's going the same direction at the same speed.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.660]   That's what you're looking for,
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.100]   someone going the same direction at the same speed,
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.260]   someone pursuing Christ at the same pace.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.380]   Like, and let me say this in case you're confused.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.720]   You should be recklessly,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.420]   you should be pursuing Christ with reckless abandon,
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.380]   with everything you got, hard and fast,
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.900]   and you should find someone who's pursuing Christ that,
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.300]   "Hey guys, listen, 'cause I know this stuff is hard.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.360]   "I know Christian dating is complicated.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.780]   "I know we've complicated it with all these made up rules
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.040]   "that aren't even in the Bible,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.160]   "and I just want to make it simple for you.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.200]   "What if, like just challenge me on this,
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.540]   "what if it's just that simple?"
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.600]   Like, what if you're just to leave here
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.120]   and find someone who's pursuing Christ
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.460]   as hard and fast as you are,
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.860]   and you're to be pursuing Christ hard and fast?
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.380]   What if, guys, what if the creator of the heavens
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.700]   and the earth, like want you to leave here
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.140]   and it just to be that easy?
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.880]   Like not more complicated than that.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.300]   Now we can, you know, you're gonna leave here
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.140]   and think about that and say,
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.020]   "But what about chemistry and this and that?"
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.900]   And I just say, "Let's just consider,
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.620]   "I wonder what the success rate,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.420]   "like let's just say we took 100 people
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.580]   "and they have wild chemistry.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.400]   "Like let's say we made up this show, just pretend.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.340]   "We took a guy and we took about how many girls?
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.840]   "15, 17 girls, 12 girls, how many?
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:28.160]   "25 girls, and we said,
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.000]   "Hey, we want you just to go on dates.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.260]   "In fact, we're going to pay for some crazy dates,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.960]   "helicopter rides and whatnot.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.220]   "And we're gonna throw parties
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.460]   "and we're gonna create chemistry."
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.940]   And we saw, "Hey, how many of those at the end of,
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.380]   "let's just say we did that like 27 times,
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.780]   "hypothetically speaking."
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.260]   And we saw how many of those were successful
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.940]   versus over here, we just took a man and a woman
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.640]   who loved God and we put them together and said,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.620]   "Hey, y'all be married."
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.500]   But they both loved God.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.160]   You know that the divorce rate among a man and a woman
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.960]   who are recklessly pursuing Christ, you know what it is?
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.260]   Zero.
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.020]   There's never been a divorce between a man and a woman
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.260]   who are recklessly pursuing Christ.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.700]   It's never happened in the history of the world.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   Divorce rate's zero.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:25.060]   And so girls, I know you're thinking,
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.480]   "But it's not that easy."
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.220]   I know you are.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.100]   I want you to know that God controls the hearts of kings
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.220]   and of boys.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.740]   And you,
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.780]   and you not getting asked out
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.420]   may be his incredible mercy in your life.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.580]   Okay?
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.100]   It may be his incredible grace.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.800]   And this is not a slam at the guys, but I see a lot of boys.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.100]   And so the Lord who loves you may be protecting you
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:00.940]   from something.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:07.780]   And boys, men, men, I wanna help you.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.580]   If I can help you in any way, prepare yourself for that
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.420]   'cause I've also see a lot of men.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.460]   And that's the truth.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:21.740]   And so men, find someone godly.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:27.620]   If you want marriage, find a godly woman and ask her out.
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.180]   That's your assignment.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.060]   You can even say, "Hey, I was at the porch
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.700]   "and he told me I had to do this."
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.540]   Find a godly woman and ask her out.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.460]   Okay?
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.940]   The one that you're like, "Man, I wish, you know,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.020]   "my friend should date her."
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.860]   Like that one.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:53.460]   And girls, when a godly guy asks you out, say yes.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.300]   'Cause can I tell you something?
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.500]   'Cause he's scared, you need to know that.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.320]   You're like, I know you're like,
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.620]   "Man, why don't godly guys ask girls out?"
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.380]   Here's why, because they're scared.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.380]   Because you guys are terrifying, okay?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.500]   Because when we ask you that, it's truth, man.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.960]   You're terrifying.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.800]   You're terrifying.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.260]   In that moment, what we've done is we've taken
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.220]   all of our strength and authority and any power that we have
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.060]   and we just set it in your hand.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.340]   And we sit there vulnerable,
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.420]   waiting for you to say yes or no.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.100]   And if you say no, you are rejecting us.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.080]   Like you say, this is what you're saying.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.500]   You look at us and you say, "You know what?
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.220]   "I don't choose you."
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.700]   And we go, "I know, it hurts."
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.060]   And we go like this, you know?
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.260]   And it feels like we can't recover from that.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.700]   And so you're like, "Man, I wish guys
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.580]   "would ask more girls out."
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.720]   Well, guys are like, "Man, I wish girls would say yes."
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.200]   And so girls, if a godly guy asks you out, say yes.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.680]   And if you have to say no, say why.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.160]   The girls email me all the time.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.840]   I mean, truly, like, "Hey, what do I say
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.040]   "if I'm not interested?"
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.480]   Say you're not interested and say why.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.440]   But that feels mean.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.800]   Listen, we'll bounce back, okay?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.160]   We're gonna call our community group.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.680]   They'll rally around us, pray, you know?
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.600]   James 5, 16, the prayers of righteous
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.960]   are powerful and effective.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.400]   We'll come back from that, okay?
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.380]   The spirit of God will move.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.880]   But guys, ask a godly girl out.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.080]   Girls, if a godly guy asks you out, say yes.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   And what if it's that simple?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.480]   And you say, "Well, what if I'm not attracted to them?
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.200]   "What if attraction comes later?"
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.000]   Like, I can't tell you how many marriages I've done.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.480]   I'm like, "Man, I was not into him, but man, today."
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.120]   You know? (congregation laughing)
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.520]   I hear it all the time.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.120]   And so men, be agents of God and ask out godly girls.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.700]   And girls, if you feel like, "Man, I just feel so helpless.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.160]   "I can't, there's like nothing."
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.000]   You know what you can do?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.400]   There's one simple thing that you can do,
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.000]   and you can do it every single day, is you can pray.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.560]   And some people will say, "Well, JP, you know,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.120]   "but there's that mess with my heart."
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.400]   I'm like, "Man, I trust God in that."
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.840]   Like, as you pray, God is gonna align your heart
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.160]   with what he's doing.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.780]   But before you get angry at God,
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.280]   like, make sure you prayed every single day
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   for the past three years, or ever long, right?
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.840]   And if you haven't prayed,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.020]   like, I wouldn't waste any time being angry.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.320]   I'm just gonna end with a verse.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.120]   It's 1 John 4, seven.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.440]   It says, "Dear friends, let us love one another."
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.520]   It really says in the Greek, it says, "Beloved,"
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.240]   or loved ones, those who are loved,
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.880]   "Let us love one another, for love comes from God.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.820]   "Everyone who loved has been born of God
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.880]   "and knows God.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.180]   "Whoever does not love does not know God,
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.000]   "because God is love.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.920]   "This is how God showed his love among us.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.420]   "He sent his one and only Son into the world
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.580]   "that we might live through him."
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:49.720]   And so, I want you to leave here.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.600]   And I want you to, it says, "Cling to what is good."
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.400]   I want you to cling to the Father.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.200]   Love comes from the Father.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.500]   Those that know him, here's the reality.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.340]   No one who, someone who doesn't know God
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.100]   cannot live out 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:04.940]   They can't.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.580]   What I'm saying, so I'm clear.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.760]   Your atheist friend cannot love
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.300]   like God calls them to love.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.020]   It's impossible.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:15.420]   And someone who has been born of God,
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.060]   they know God, they're walking with him,
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:17.980]   they're pursuing him.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.140]   They can't not love that way.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.380]   That is how they love.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.660]   And that is why God, I believe God,
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.980]   the scripture says, "Hey, this is all you need to know.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.660]   "You've made it so complicated.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.920]   "You've been listening to Kim and Kanye too long."
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.760]   It's more simple than that, simpler than that.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.920]   It's this simple.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.000]   This is what you need to know.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.080]   And so, in summary, fake love is defined by fake sources,
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.640]   is self-serving, and is rooted in how they make you feel.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.680]   Real love is defined by sacrificial service.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.960]   It is sincere, and it is not motivated by fear.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.920]   So find real love, knowing what it looks like,
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.680]   and where to look.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:06.780]   We were at the fair this past weekend on Sunday.
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.620]   We went out to the fair.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.800]   Anybody been to the fair?
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.400]   Okay, wow.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.700]   Wow.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.420]   You're like, is it really that simple though?
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:16.660]   Anybody been to the fair?
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.500]   Yeah?
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.600]   Okay, cool, good.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.780]   So you've been out to the fair.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.140]   So we were out at the fair,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.820]   and so I went with my kids.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.280]   Like, the fair is like the only place
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.920]   where you pay a bunch of money to go in
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.760]   and pay a bunch of money.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.400]   And so we went in there, and no, it's so true.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.880]   And the rides, they were doing the rides and whatnot.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.980]   And then I was like, "Hey, okay, let's go.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.320]   "We gotta go do something else."
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.440]   My kids too, my kids were complaining,
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.680]   "No, Dad, we still wanna do rides."
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.120]   I'm like, "No, Daddy's broke, we can't."
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.320]   And I'm like, "Let's go do something else."
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.680]   And so two of them were really complaining.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.520]   I've got three kids, and so my oldest, she wasn't.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.340]   She was cool with that.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.420]   "Hey, guys, we can trust Daddy."
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.360]   I'm like, "That's right."
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.420]   And so we went, and so what I did then is I said,
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.020]   "You know what, we're gonna come back and do one ride."
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.900]   And I said, "And you get to decide what it is,
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.400]   "but we're gonna go do other things."
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.540]   And she was like, "Oh, Daddy, I wanna do that ride.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.020]   "It's like a roller coaster, but it goes in a circle.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.960]   "It kinda goes in a room and comes around.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.860]   "It's called the Love Bug.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.840]   "I don't know if you saw it,
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.720]   "but they play that music in there,
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.940]   "and it's just like this roller coaster.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.280]   "It goes up and down, but it's not really a roller coaster.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.600]   "It's these cars that are on a track,
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.180]   "and it just goes around in a circle real fast."
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.540]   And she's like, "I wanna do that one."
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.700]   You know, and I was like, "Great."
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.620]   And so then we went and saw the animals,
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.740]   and we went to the car shows, but she just kept,
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.000]   "I can't wait to do that ride.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:26.840]   "We're gonna do that ride.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.660]   "It's gonna be great."
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.500]   And I was like, "Hey, listen,
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.240]   "like enjoy where we're at right now.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.700]   "And we're going to do that,
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.720]   "but like right now, let's enjoy where we're at.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.000]   "You know, look, look, that car,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.160]   "and look, there's a, you know, 600 bunnies,
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.400]   "and there's a cow."
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.900]   And I'm like, "Hey, enjoy where we're at."
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.800]   And she's like, "But I can't wait to do that ride."
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.140]   And so it became time before we were gonna leave,
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.140]   we go back into the Midway, and we're gonna do that ride.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.900]   And so we get some more tickets, you know,
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:51.740]   more to the house.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:56.680]   And, and, and, and we're, she's standing in line.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.920]   I'm just gonna send the kids on it.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.020]   And so Monica and I are watching,
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.300]   and they get on to go onto this ride.
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.200]   And you know, my son, my youngest, is the smallest,
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.600]   and then my middle, and then the oldest.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.680]   And, and, and so what they did is they said,
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.580]   "Well, the youngest needs to be on the inside,
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.180]   "and you, because the ride, the centrifugal force, like."
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.500]   And so they put the youngest on the inside,
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.200]   and then the middle, and then my oldest,
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.900]   the one that wanted to ride the ride, she's on the end.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.260]   And they start the ride, and it starts going around.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.660]   And at first, it's that look of pure joy,
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.140]   like she's just having so much fun,
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.700]   'cause it's not a scary ride.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.540]   And she's just having so much fun, and laughing.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.320]   It's like everything she thought it was going to be.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.540]   Well, then the guy's like, "Let's go faster."
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.180]   And they, as they're going faster,
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.980]   like her brother and her sister are coming toward her,
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.260]   and I'm watching, 'cause I'm even filming on slow-mo,
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.620]   you know, so I can Instagram it.
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:49.500]   And, and, and I watch her face,
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.180]   as her face changes from joy,
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.060]   and she starts trying to push them off of her,
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.420]   like, "Get off of me."
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.780]   And then it kind of turns to like sadness,
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.060]   and then it kind of turns to terror, you know?
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.940]   And, and she starts in the middle of the ride,
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.060]   she just starts weeping.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.040]   And I'm, it's hard to watch as a dad, right?
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.860]   I'm like, "Oh my goodness, stop the ride, stop the ride."
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.200]   And, and she just starts crying.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.500]   And I'm watching it.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.140]   And, and the ride comes to a stop,
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.740]   and Monica and I are like, "Oh no," you know?
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.460]   And she gets off, and she runs off, and she runs to me,
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.580]   and she just buries her head in my stomach.
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:28.460]   And she just holds me, and she says,
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.160]   "Daddy, they were hurting me.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.180]   Daddy, they were hurting me.
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:38.300]   They were hurting me, and it wouldn't stop."
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.540]   And there's this thing that you're,
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.380]   you're so looking forward to,
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.820]   you're so excited about.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.060]   But if you've defined it incorrectly,
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.860]   you're going to get on that roller coaster,
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.500]   and it is going to hurt you,
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.680]   like it has so many people.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.780]   And some of you, you've been in that roller,
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.540]   on that roller coaster, you said, "I love you,
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.940]   I love you too."
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:11.740]   Long conversations, the text message is late at night,
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.540]   "Goodnight, I love you."
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.860]   And you've been hurt.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:21.380]   And some of you, you're on the ride right now,
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.580]   and you need to get off.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.620]   And those of you that came in walking with a limp,
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:31.020]   because you know you've been hurt, there's heartbreak,
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.580]   you're losing hope in love.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:38.060]   You need to do what, exactly what my 12-year-old daughter
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.620]   did, is you need to run to your father,
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.620]   and embrace him, cling to what is good.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.100]   And he understands, he understands loss,
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.940]   he lost his son for you.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.260]   And there is no greater love than that.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.460]   And love comes from him.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.900]   And he's never left you, nor forsaken you.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.300]   Forsaken you.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.340]   He's crazy about you, he is crazy about you.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:11.420]   And if you're wanting to know how to love,
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.100]   you leave here, and you start with him.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.820]   We pray that you would.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.780]   Father, help us to know what love is.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:25.420]   Help us to cling to what is good, and hate what is evil.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.860]   And help us to leave here with a sincere love.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:33.060]   Thank you for the example that you've given us
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.820]   in Jesus Christ.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.220]   For all that you've done for us in Jesus Christ.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.540]   Father, help us to live for you, through him.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:46.020]   Help us to be sincere with one another,
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.620]   and kind, and honest.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:51.060]   Father, would you take the things that we came in here with
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.740]   that are not of you, and would you leave them,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.300]   help us to leave them behind.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.580]   And the things that are of you, God,
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.420]   help us to cling to them, to know them,
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.180]   to look for them, to search them.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.220]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.060]   Amen.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:15.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
