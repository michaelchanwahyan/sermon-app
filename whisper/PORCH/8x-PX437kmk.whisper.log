[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.120]   - All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.960]   We doing okay?
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.920]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.400]   Great to see you.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.080]   Man, I love the energy.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.160]   Welcome, it's so good to be with you this Tuesday night.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200]   Not just those of you here in the room.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.520]   It is always a joy to see you here,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.800]   but also everyone that's tuning in online.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.440]   Like thanks everybody here and there,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   just for making time to be a part of what God is doing.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.680]   We just came out of a worship set that was really powerful.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120]   And it's not just because we got talented people up here
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.920]   or because man, the band sounds awesome.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.680]   They got the PA tuned in perfectly.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.320]   The reason it's powerful is because,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   is because the presence of God
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.560]   delights to meet with his people.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.320]   He delights to meet with you.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.760]   And so I hope if you haven't experienced that already,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.000]   you can expect that for yourself tonight
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.640]   because that is absolutely what he wants.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.320]   Davy said it, but we choose him
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   in response to him choosing us.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.120]   And so are you gonna choose him tonight?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.240]   That's the question on the table for you.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.760]   To help you get to that place,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.620]   we've got a very special friend
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.200]   that's going to be teaching the word of God to us.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   I could not be more excited to introduce to you this person
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.400]   for the first time to the porch.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.960]   He is one of the humblest men that I know.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.840]   Genuinely, if you spend any time around him,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.800]   you know he delights to lower himself
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.560]   so that way he might lift Christ on high.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.160]   He is one of the most trusted voices I know.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.840]   He is revered for the wisdom he offers in rooms.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.500]   Oftentimes whenever he speaks,
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.360]   the conversation just kind of concludes
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.520]   because that was the right thing
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.480]   that we were all waiting to hear.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.920]   And he faithfully serves as the executive director
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.400]   of discipleship here at Watermark Community Church.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   So porch, would you do a really good job
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   in helping me welcome for the very first time
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.680]   Dave Bruscus to the stage.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.020]   (congregation cheering)
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.280]   - Love you, man.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.680]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.100]   Hey friends, great to be with you tonight.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.960]   Tonight has already been meaningful to me,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   just our time of worship together.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.840]   Found myself tearing up being emotional.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.720]   I don't know how I'm gonna get through tonight,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.760]   but I am glad to be with you.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320]   I was on a road trip years ago with my dear friend, Randy.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   Randy brought his eight-year-old son with us, Truett.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.880]   Truett was in the backseat.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.080]   We had a dual cab pickup truck
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.600]   and Truett was obsessed with Pokemon.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.080]   Anybody been there before?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.480]   And Truett, some of you, it's okay to come clean tonight.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.160]   Truett had a three-ring binder
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.880]   with plastic dividers of every Pokemon card he collected.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.760]   And he began to run me through every character's strengths,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.720]   weaknesses, uniqueness.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.480]   So I learned all about Pikachu and I learned all about Psyduck
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.320]   and I learned all about Snorlax.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.280]   How cool is it that you could change the world
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.440]   just by sleeping?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.560]   That's my favorite, is Snorlax.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.800]   So we went through the characters,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.720]   but Truett's presentation began to lag a little bit.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   And we were now in 30 minutes of him talking nonstop.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.480]   And finally, his dad looked back at him and said,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.000]   "Hey, son, listen, I'm not so sure
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.680]   "that Pastor Dave is as interested in Pokemon as you are.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   "Why don't we wrap this thing up?"
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   And Truett looked defeated, he looked angry,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.160]   and he also looked determined.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.380]   He said, "Dad, you give me 30 more minutes with Pastor Dave
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.920]   "and I promise you he will love Pokemon
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.320]   "every bit as much as I do."
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.120]   So here's the deal tonight.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.320]   Kylan gave me free reign to talk about
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.040]   anything I wanted to talk about.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.080]   So I have chosen my favorite passage in all of Scripture.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.720]   And if you give me the next 30 minutes,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.840]   I'm pretty confident that it will become
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.780]   your favorite passage of Scripture as well.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.980]   If you have a Bible, turn with me to Colossians chapter one.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.960]   We're gonna look at verses 15 through 21 tonight.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.200]   And as we look at these verses,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.260]   I think they're so critically important
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.280]   because they answer what I think
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.760]   is the most important question a Christian can answer,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.640]   and that is, who is Jesus to us?
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.880]   So that's what I wanna talk about tonight
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.040]   as we look at this text.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.160]   I want to answer the question through the lens
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.260]   of this passage of Scripture, who is Jesus to us?
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.800]   And after we come to that answer,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.320]   I wanna give you one specific action item.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.020]   So glad to be with you, let's pray together.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.360]   Father, thank you for tonight.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.240]   Thank you for everyone who's in the room here in Dallas.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   Thank you for all those who are joining us online.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.900]   Father, we know that according to Jesus, there's no one,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.460]   no one in this space that's here by accident tonight
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.380]   because Father, you are seeking worshipers
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.340]   who will worship you in spirit and truth.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.500]   And tonight is not so much about us getting ourselves here,
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.560]   it's you bringing us here that we might experience
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.000]   the joy of your presence, of knowing you, of worshiping you.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.740]   Father, I praise we open up the Bible tonight.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.860]   Through your Holy Spirit, you would open up our eyes
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.940]   in a fresh way to who Jesus is,
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.300]   that we would see him clearly.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.220]   Father, you know our tendency to downsize Jesus,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.400]   to make him smaller so he fits into our lives,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.100]   to make him in our own image.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.460]   I pray you would break apart all the things
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.260]   that we've constructed that are false tonight.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.540]   And I pray that we would see Jesus as he truly is.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.700]   Holy Spirit, I pray if there's anyone in this room tonight,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.420]   anyone joining us online who doesn't yet know Jesus,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.820]   that you would arrange an introduction,
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.100]   that lives would forever be changed,
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.380]   that Jesus would be worshiped and glorified.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.580]   In his good name we pray together, amen.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.380]   Colossians 1, we're gonna jump right into verse 15.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.340]   Simple question tonight, who is Jesus to us?
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.180]   Here we go.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.580]   He is the image of the invisible God,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.260]   the firstborn of all creation.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.220]   Listen to this.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.660]   For by him, all things were created in heaven and on earth,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.980]   visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.740]   or rulers or authorities.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.780]   All things were created through him and for him.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.540]   And he is before all things,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.720]   and in him all things hold together.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.700]   I wish we could take these first few verses
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.180]   and spend hours unpacking them
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.980]   'cause they're so rich with meaning.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.560]   But I wanna highlight a couple things as we get started.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.600]   First thing I want you to see as we speak of Jesus,
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.960]   he's the he we're referring to here,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.660]   is he is the image of the invisible God.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.220]   If we were to look at the original language
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.580]   of the New Testament, you would recognize this word
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.140]   because it is the word that we use for icon.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.620]   Jesus is the icon of the invisible God.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.280]   Now when we think of icon and think about this,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.220]   think of the most iconic image you can come up with.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.980]   An icon can do one of two things.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.380]   An icon can be a representation of something
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.080]   or in the biblical sense,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   it can be a manifestation of something.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.720]   Here's what scripture is telling us.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.100]   When you and I look into the face of Jesus,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.620]   we see far more than just a representation of God.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.540]   We see the very face of God itself.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.880]   I don't know if you did this during the pandemic.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.420]   Some of you might not have been old enough back then too,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.260]   but I binge watched, I'm so bored.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.780]   I binge watched so much TV.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.100]   Now, my wife, Kara loves musicals
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.180]   and because I love Kara, I have to love musicals as well.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.020]   And I had wanted to take her to see "Hamilton" at Fair Park,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.940]   but everything shut down in the pandemic.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.300]   We had binge watched everything we could binge watch.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.100]   And I thought, okay, I'm gonna splurge.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.140]   I'm gonna break my budget.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.180]   I'm gonna go ahead and buy the Disney Channel
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.060]   and we are going to watch the music "Hamilton."
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.360]   As I was, and it was a great musical.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.820]   You should see it if you haven't seen it yet.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.860]   As I was watching "Hamilton,"
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.900]   I would tell you I saw an icon,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.140]   an image of Alexander Hamilton.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.420]   Now, what I didn't see
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.880]   was a manifestation of Alexander Hamilton.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.380]   What I saw was a representation.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.560]   Lin-Manuel Miranda did a beautiful job
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.340]   of representing Alexander Hamilton,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.860]   but I didn't see a manifestation of him.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.820]   The only way I could have seen a manifestation
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.740]   of Alexander Hamilton is had his eternal spirit
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.420]   somehow been embodied in Lin-Manuel Miranda's body,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.060]   then I would have said I could see Alexander Hamilton.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.980]   God is a triune God.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.820]   The God of the Bible is three persons, one God,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.860]   co-eternal, co-worthy of worship,
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.100]   God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.860]   God the Son took on human form.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.500]   His name is Jesus.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.060]   When you and I look into the face of Jesus,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.300]   we see the very face of God.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.380]   Not only is Jesus the image of the invisible God,
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.140]   I want you to see the next thing it says about him.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.520]   He's the firstborn of all creation.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.220]   Does that seem confusing to you?
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.540]   Do you think for a second, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.740]   Dave, if Jesus is eternally God,
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.860]   then how can he be firstborn?
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.300]   How can he be connected to creation in any way?
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.740]   Well, if you look at the context of this passage,
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.580]   you understand that Jesus is not a creature, he's creator.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.020]   The text has already told us that everything that exists,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.220]   visible, invisible, things in heaven, things on the earth,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.100]   were created by Jesus, through Jesus,
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.460]   and ultimately are for Jesus.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.060]   And when we use the term firstborn,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.300]   what we mean is he's not just first in sequence,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.340]   he's first in significance.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.540]   We see this in the Bible, right?
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.820]   You read those Old Testament stories,
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.700]   and there's this weight of value
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.820]   that's placed on firstborn animals, firstborn children.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.140]   Any firstborns in the room, raise your hand.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.380]   All right, congratulations.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.460]   According to the Bible, you're more significant
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.360]   than the siblings that came after you.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.320]   Right, I love to bring this, I have one little brother.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   I love to bring this to him up all the time.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.360]   Hey man, how are you doing?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.760]   Just wanna remind you, I'm the firstborn,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.120]   and if we really wanna be biblical,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.700]   we should hope that mom and dad take the inheritance.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.040]   They split it three ways, and I get two shares,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.600]   and you get one, you know,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.760]   because that's the way things should be
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.640]   if mom and dad are gonna follow Jesus through the Bible.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.840]   And then when he gets angry, he's telling me,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.160]   "Hey man, don't be a hater, I'm just the messenger.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   "I'm just telling you what the truth is."
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   Jesus is more significant than the entirety of creation.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.280]   He's the agent of creation because everything that exists,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.600]   everything that we see and everything we don't see
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.920]   that we know exists in our world was created by Jesus,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.040]   through Jesus, and ultimately exists for Jesus.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.400]   But there's this last phrase I wanna get to
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.040]   that's so important here.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.280]   Look at it with me again, verse 17.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.000]   And he is before all things.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.560]   Here we go, ready for this?
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.440]   And in him, all things.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.960]   All things, not a few things, not most things,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.040]   all things hold together in him.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.520]   He holds all things together.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   What does that mean?
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.000]   It means Jesus is the fabric
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.680]   that gives meaning to everything that exists.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.840]   Jesus gives meaning to everything.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.980]   Everything has meaning in as much as it relates to Jesus.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.960]   Jesus is the single thread of meaning
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.880]   for everything that exists visibly and invisibly.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.760]   So if we go back to our question that we began with,
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   and that is who is Jesus to us,
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.320]   first thing I want you to think about is this.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.780]   Jesus is our meaning.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.840]   Jesus is our meaning.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.320]   You ever look around the world?
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.240]   You ever look around your neighborhood?
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.520]   You ever look around your workplace?
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.000]   You ever look around your classroom and you think,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.600]   "I can't make sense of this."
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.260]   It's really hard to piece together significance
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.260]   and meaning based on what I see.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.300]   Well, the reason for that is nothing makes sense
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.940]   apart from Jesus.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.380]   If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.300]   you're saying, "I can't make sense
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.580]   "of what's going on around me."
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.060]   That makes sense according to the Bible
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.140]   because the only way the world makes sense
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.020]   and everything in it is in relationship to Jesus.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.700]   Jesus holds all things together,
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.060]   meaning that Jesus gives meaning
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.200]   and significance to all things.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.380]   I want you to understand this clearly about the Bible.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.540]   The Bible isn't a collection of countless stories,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.160]   it's one story.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.340]   The Bible isn't 1,000 principles to live by,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.940]   it's one person to live for.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.140]   His name is Jesus.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.060]   The Bible's a story in four acts featuring one character.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.500]   It's as simple as that.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.860]   The featured character of the Bible,
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.620]   it's not the story of you and me,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.780]   it's the story of Jesus.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.900]   But here's the four acts.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.260]   The first act is creation.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.060]   God created the world through Jesus.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.860]   And when he had finished creation,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   he declared, "This is good."
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.940]   He made humankind to live in relationship with him,
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.180]   to worship him and enjoy him forever.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.340]   And everything got off to a great start.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.060]   But before we even get past the third chapter of Genesis,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.260]   everything comes undone.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.180]   Our common parents, Adam and Eve,
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.860]   they rebelled against God.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.100]   They did the very thing God said they couldn't do
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.900]   and because of their sin, their treason, their rebellion,
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.220]   everything is corrupted.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.580]   Everything is broken.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.980]   That's chapter two of the Bible.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.180]   First chapter is creation, second chapter is fall.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.860]   Humankind and the world around us is fallen, it's broken.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.980]   But here comes the third chapter.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.180]   And this is when the story really starts to get good.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.180]   God in his mercy, God in his patience,
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.100]   God in his kindness, God for the sake of his glory
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.180]   sends his son Jesus on a rescue mission.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.820]   Jesus takes on human form.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.580]   He lives the perfect life that no one else can live.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.060]   He goes to the cross and there he dies a brutal, painful,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.500]   God-forsaken death, the death that you and I deserve to die.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.820]   He's put in the grave.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.780]   But friends, here's the good news tonight.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.500]   You're not gonna ever find the bones of Jesus.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.580]   He is risen from the grave, physically, bodily.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.540]   He's at the right hand of God the Father.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.220]   One day he'll come and he'll rule and reign forever.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.900]   And as we enter in this third chapter,
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.780]   the chapter that you and I find ourselves living in today,
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.900]   it's the chapter of redemption.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.180]   You know what God is doing in the world?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.460]   God is drawing together a people from himself,
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.580]   a people from every tongue, every tribe,
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.500]   redeeming a people for himself,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.700]   promising to forgive them of their sin,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.900]   free them from their sin, live life with them,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.740]   and ultimately look forward to the fourth chapter,
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.580]   which is still in front of us.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.500]   We're not there yet.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.700]   It's the chapter of restoration or recreation.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.540]   The day will come when God will restore all things.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.820]   And you and I, as followers of Jesus,
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.780]   will be with him forever.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.060]   There'll be no more sin.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.340]   There'll be no more suffering.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.740]   There'll be no more death.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.420]   But friends, today we find ourselves in chapter three.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.720]   And if you're here tonight, even as a follower of Jesus,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.100]   perhaps especially as a follower of Jesus,
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.420]   and you're thinking life is hard, you're right.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.140]   We haven't entered into chapter four yet.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.340]   Jesus has forgiven us.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.660]   Jesus has come to live in us through the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.180]   And he is not only forgiving us
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.900]   from sin and rebellion and brokenness,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.260]   he's freeing us from it.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.720]   But we're not entirely there yet.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.600]   We're gonna sit.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.060]   We're gonna experience suffering.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.620]   We're gonna live in a world that's broken,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.740]   and yet God promises never to leave us or forsake us.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.440]   He's gonna be with us.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.700]   We will be his people and he will be our God.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.140]   And together we'll walk towards the fourth chapter,
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.940]   anticipating with hope the day when Jesus returns
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.940]   and makes everything right.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.820]   Until then, it's gonna be hard.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.480]   Is your life hard tonight?
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.900]   Are you struggling tonight?
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.860]   Do you find yourself in a season perhaps of suffering?
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.500]   Perhaps a season of fighting sin
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.540]   and you just feel like you're not gaining any ground?
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.060]   I've got four daughters.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   My wife and I have been married 38 years
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.140]   come this December.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.100]   Four daughters and four sons-in-law
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.180]   and now eight grandkids.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.100]   I love them dearly.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.140]   Our youngest daughter, who's here tonight,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.500]   at 20 years old was diagnosed with stage four lymphoma.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.780]   And it was devastating.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.860]   The good news was from the doctors
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.860]   that this is a treatable form of cancer.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.020]   The tough news was it's gonna be hard treatment
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.220]   to get better.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.280]   And so she began chemotherapy.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.340]   Perhaps some of you in the room
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.780]   have had a similar diagnosis.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.700]   Maybe you've suffered through cancer.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.820]   I'll never forget the first day we took Jillian
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.340]   to her chemotherapy appointment.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.660]   And she went into this large room
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.700]   and she was the youngest person in the room.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.740]   The room was filled with people that looked very sick.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.500]   And everyone caught her eye
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.620]   because they thought to themselves,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.940]   why is the person that young in this room?
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.340]   She got hooked up to her chemotherapy treatment
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.740]   and she sat there for a few hours.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.620]   And as we left, she physically looked different
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.260]   than when she walked in the room.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.060]   Skin tone had changed, her countenance had changed.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   And so we went home and I know my little girl well,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.320]   when she's not feeling well, she's just gonna sleep it off.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.460]   And I know even when she's depressed and sad,
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.540]   she's just gonna sleep out her feelings.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.220]   And so she goes to her room,
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.620]   Karen and I are sitting there at the table
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.700]   and we're just overwhelmed by what she's experiencing.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.820]   And I'm really thinking through,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.020]   Lord, how do I make sense of this?
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.980]   Jesus, I know you love us, I know you're with us,
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.140]   I know we're in the third chapter,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.620]   there's a fourth chapter to come.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.300]   I know this is a time of redemption,
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.980]   the time of restoration isn't here yet,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.060]   but would you please help my little girl?
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.780]   And then I begin to think back
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.340]   about all the times I failed as a dad.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.660]   And I began to think why she's laying in bed,
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.460]   suffering from the effects of chemotherapy, fighting cancer.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.020]   I began to think, I hope my voice
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.580]   isn't rattling around in her head saying,
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.220]   hey, suck it up, do more, try harder, tough it out,
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.620]   you can do this.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.020]   So I remember just praying, Lord,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.260]   I know in this chapter of the story of the Bible,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.680]   you promise to be with your people,
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.060]   you promise to minister to people.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.340]   I said, Father in heaven,
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.420]   would you please overcome my deficiencies
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.260]   and my failures of my little girl?
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.660]   And would you care for her in ways that I can't?
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.820]   A few hours later, she emerged from her room,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.140]   we had a quiet dinner together, she wasn't feeling well,
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.900]   her appetite wasn't there, she kind of picked over her food,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.780]   there wasn't much to say.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   And right before we finished the meal,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.460]   she said, very casually, matter of factly,
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.020]   oh, God spoke to me.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.820]   We're like, wait, what?
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.380]   Like that deserves a better introduction,
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.780]   but please tell us what it was he told you.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.440]   And she said, I was right in that place
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.380]   when you wake up and you've been asleep for a while,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.500]   and as soon as I woke up,
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.180]   I heard this voice that said, my daughter.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.800]   And she said, Dad, I looked around the room
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.180]   thinking that that must be you
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.460]   because you're the one who calls me that,
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.900]   and I looked around the room and there was no one there,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.780]   so I think the Father was just reminding me
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.860]   that I belong to him and he is with me
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.420]   in the midst of this suffering.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.700]   Friends, that's the meaning that Jesus gives life.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.260]   All of life, the good things, the bad things,
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.420]   the in-between things,
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.940]   the things that are visible and invisible,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.820]   every experience you have, all of who you are,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.180]   all your thoughts, all your feelings, all your words,
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.100]   all your actions, all your relationships
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.720]   have meaning in as much as they relate to Jesus.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.260]   Jesus is our meaning,
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.500]   which raises the question for us tonight is,
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.660]   are we living meaningful lives?
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:02.280]   Are we understanding and viewing the life
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.040]   that God has assigned us to live
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.860]   through the meaning that we have in Jesus?
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.000]   I want that for you tonight.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.400]   I want that for us tonight.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.440]   Let's go back to Colossians.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.960]   Verse 18, "Who is Jesus to us?
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.400]   "And he is the head of the body, the church.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.520]   "He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   "that in everything he might be preeminent."
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.280]   I love that statement about Jesus.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   Jesus has done something that no one else has ever done
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.120]   in the history of the world.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.360]   And because Jesus has risen from the dead,
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.640]   he has manifested and claimed his victory over death
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.560]   and sin and Satan.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.600]   And by doing so, he is preeminent in all things.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.440]   He's the head of the church.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   Every church in our city and in our state
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.640]   and in our country and around the world that loves Jesus,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.220]   if they had an org chart,
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.280]   guess who would be at the top of that org chart?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.400]   Jesus, why?
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.540]   Because it's his church.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.320]   It's not yours, it's not mine, it's his.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.480]   We are his people.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.400]   He deserves the top space.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.240]   He is preeminent in everything.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.240]   He is first, he is foremost, he is supreme.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.800]   That's who Jesus is.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.520]   Second thing I want you to know about Jesus tonight is
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.600]   Jesus is our mission.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.800]   Now let me explain that.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.400]   'Cause I know some of you are gonna know the Bible
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.160]   well enough to say, "Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.760]   "I got you on this one, Dave."
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.460]   No, no, our mission is to make disciples.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.420]   You would be right.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.120]   But I want you to understand what the end point
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.080]   or the destination are,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.360]   what it means finally to make disciples.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   And I want us to look at Jesus's words themselves.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.380]   Look with me, if you will, at Matthew 28.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.560]   We're gonna pick up in verse 18, the words of Jesus.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.600]   Jesus is about to ascend into heaven.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.080]   It's some of his final words to his disciples
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.320]   as they remain on earth.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.120]   Listen to what he says.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.420]   Verse 18, Matthew 28, "And Jesus came and said to them,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.120]   "all authority in heaven and on earth
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.000]   "has been given to me."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.040]   What does that sound like to you?
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.640]   That's Colossians 1, isn't it?
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.080]   All, that word comes up again.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.220]   "All authority in heaven and on earth, Jesus says is mine.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.860]   "I am now in charge of all things
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.000]   "and will be forever in heaven and on earth."
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.880]   So he states his position first.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.520]   Then he says this in verse 19.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.540]   "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.600]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.560]   "and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.480]   "all that I have commanded you."
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.600]   I love this tagline.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   "And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age."
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.080]   I want you to see what Jesus is saying here.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.440]   He's giving his people marching orders.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.120]   He's about to ascend into heaven.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.540]   And he proclaims, it's like he has this sandwich.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.640]   The two pieces of bread are,
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.360]   "Hey, all authority has been given to me."
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   And the other piece of bread is,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.480]   "And I'll be with you forever."
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.140]   But between that sandwich is the meat.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.600]   I want you to make disciples.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.520]   But I want you to see what it means to be a disciple.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.240]   It means that we are baptized
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.000]   and that's the right of initiation
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.100]   into the family of Jesus.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.700]   Let me say something real quick.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.000]   I never cease to be surprised
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.240]   by how many professing Christians have not been baptized.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   I want to encourage you to not.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.200]   If you've not been baptized, would you let somebody know?
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.760]   If you're a part of another local church,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.200]   if you're a part of this church, Watermark,
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.040]   you're not a part of this church,
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   would you let somebody know
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.400]   it's very important you be baptized?
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   Not so that God will love you.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   He already has in Jesus, but it's an act of obedience.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.960]   Baptism is the initiation point,
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.880]   but what does culmination of discipleship look like?
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.200]   Jesus says, "Teach them all things so that they may," what?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.680]   "Know everything about me."
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   No, he says, "So that they will obey me."
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.640]   So they observe all that I've commanded.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.960]   In other words, the very essence of baptism
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.560]   is bringing as many people as we possibly can
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.880]   under the preeminence of Jesus.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.840]   So that Jesus rules over every thought, every word,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.200]   every feeling, every action,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.120]   every relationship over everyone, everywhere.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.480]   That's the mission.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.840]   Jesus is our mission.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.200]   I was a part of a church that was started
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.280]   near the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.120]   and it was a dynamic neighborhood.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.440]   If you've ever been in a college setting
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.840]   and the neighborhoods around the college
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.240]   are usually pretty wild, right?
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.720]   People that live there tend to not like organized religion.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.040]   They tend to be very progressive
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.960]   in their political persuasions.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.320]   And this was that setting.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.760]   And so as we started the church there,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.000]   I just decided I'd spend some time
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.880]   walking up and down the street by where we met.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.040]   We met in an old Route 66 movie theater.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.960]   It's a really cool setting.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.640]   And I was just gonna walk up and down the street,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.000]   move in and out of stores and bars and restaurants.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.200]   And I was gonna pastor people
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.400]   whether they wanted me to or not,
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.920]   like with a degree of respect.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.000]   But hey, I just wanna care for you.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.880]   I wanna tell you about Jesus.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.720]   I was just gonna do that.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.760]   I struck up a relationship with a young woman
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   who had a store that exported rugs from Afghanistan.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.640]   Really cool store.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.140]   Also had some fine art from South Asia.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.440]   I got to know her.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.680]   Let's just say her name was Flo
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.320]   because that's what her name was.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.800]   And so I got to know Flo
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.880]   and we began to have conversations about Jesus.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.160]   And I was surprised at how open Flo was.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.960]   And so I would go by once or twice a week
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.880]   and when customers weren't coming in
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.840]   and needing her attention,
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.320]   she was the sole storekeeper,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.400]   we'd have conversations.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.440]   And I began to realize like her heart
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.120]   is growing tender towards Jesus, right?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.400]   She was moving towards Jesus in a significant way.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.640]   And as we begin to have conversations about Jesus,
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.800]   she was growing closer and closer to knowing him.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.880]   And as we, and I'll pick up the story in a minute
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.440]   'cause it fits later, so hold on with it, okay?
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.480]   I almost got ahead of myself.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.500]   I'll tell you the end of that story in just a minute.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.840]   But that's our mission, right?
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.680]   That's what we want.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.560]   The mission isn't about Flo.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.160]   The mission is ultimately about Jesus.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   It's about you and I knowing Jesus personally.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.240]   It's about Jesus having rule and reign over our life
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.880]   in every capacity, over every relationship,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.700]   over every work endeavor, over all that we are.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.760]   We want Jesus to be preeminent.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.440]   He is preeminent in the church.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.320]   I want you to think about mission differently.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.960]   Going back to this church that I was a part of
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.440]   in this neighborhood that was a little bit eclectic,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.920]   is a little bit avant-garde.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.480]   I used to park behind a car that had a bumper sticker.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   I love bumper stickers and really creative parts.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.000]   It's like, you ever go look at bumper stickers in Austin?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They're just weird because Austin is weird,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.180]   but they're really entertaining.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.880]   Well, this is a place like that.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.560]   And so I parked behind this car every day
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.720]   that had a bumper sticker that said, get this,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.200]   I want you to think about this for a minute.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.080]   What if, what if the UFO is the alien?
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.320]   That's a really interesting question, isn't it?
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.400]   Like, what if we shouldn't be looking for little green men
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.840]   to come out of a spaceship?
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.160]   What if the spaceship in and of itself is the alien?
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.320]   Like if it's a robotic AI thing?
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.220]   I don't know.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.800]   I just found that fascinating.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.200]   It made me think about UFOs differently.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.840]   I want you to think about mission differently tonight.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   What if the ultimate point of mission is Jesus himself?
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.240]   What if mission ultimately culminates
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   in people knowing and loving and trusting
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.280]   and obeying Jesus in all their lives?
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.520]   And mission took root all over the world
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.680]   so that in every tribe, every tongue,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.760]   every place among every people,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.520]   Jesus rightly held the preeminent place
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.860]   that he deserves to have.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.120]   Wouldn't that be amazing?
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.040]   Here's what one theologian says about this idea
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.360]   of Jesus being preeminent.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.760]   Theologian from the past century,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.400]   a Dutch theologian named Abraham Kuyper, he said this,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.680]   "There is not a square inch in the whole domain
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.920]   "of human existence over which Christ does not cry, 'Mine.'"
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.680]   Jesus is preeminent over everything.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   He's the head of the church in that he's preeminent.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.780]   He's first, he's supreme, he's foremost over everything.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.520]   Are we living on mission tonight?
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.160]   Mission begins with you.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.080]   And it begins with you living
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.840]   with the preeminence of Jesus over every aspect
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.240]   and every dimension and every relationship
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.080]   in every facet of your life.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.400]   And then it extends into the lives of others.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.880]   Now, one last thing, and I'll pick up the story with flow.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.800]   Look, if you will, with me back at Colossians 1.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.200]   Jesus is our meaning, Jesus is our mission.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.320]   One more thing I need you to know about Jesus.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.880]   Verse 19, "For in him, all the fullness of God
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.900]   "was pleased to dwell and through him
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.720]   "to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.920]   "whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.080]   "making peace by the blood of his cross."
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.840]   Here's the third thing I want you to see about Jesus.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.320]   Jesus is our message.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Friends, that's the message of the Bible.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.200]   That's the storyline, start to finish of the Bible.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.880]   It is message about Jesus, it is a story of Jesus.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   Four acts that we already went over,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   but the central figure of the Bible isn't me, isn't you,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.640]   it's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.240]   And he is the message that we've been entrusted with
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.620]   to share to others.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.760]   Specifically, I want you to see a couple things here.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.520]   First of all, the fullness of God
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.680]   was pleased to dwell in Jesus, isn't that amazing?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.920]   Jesus isn't some afterthought of God saying,
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.120]   "Oh no, this thing has gone terribly wrong.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.480]   "How am I gonna pull this out of the ditch?
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.200]   "Oh, I know, Jesus."
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.960]   The fullness of God is pleased to dwell in Jesus.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.840]   Jesus is fully God and he's fully human.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.960]   And he was God's plan from the very beginning.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.800]   Why?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.240]   'Cause God has great purpose in Jesus.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   What is God's purpose in Jesus?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   To reconcile to himself, not some things,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.000]   not a few things, not many things, but what?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   All things.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.160]   All things.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.680]   All things will ultimately be reconciled to God
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.520]   through Jesus.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.540]   In chapter two of the Bible, when humankind fell into sin,
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.880]   the whole world, visible and invisible, was corrupted.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.520]   Everything was broken.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.040]   Everything was antagonized in its relationship to God.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.440]   You and I, here's the bad news tonight in the Bible,
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.240]   you and I, by being human beings,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.040]   are born in an antagonistic, broken relationship with God.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   God considers our very first parent's sin, Adam and Eve,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:42.880]   as our sin.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.840]   We are born guilty.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.120]   We are sinners by birth and you know what?
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.800]   As we grow older, we get really good at it.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.760]   We begin to excel at living a life
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.160]   independent from God, apart from God,
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.000]   not honoring God for who he is,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.720]   trying to mold God into our own image,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.240]   to make our lives work, to try to use God
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.280]   to be some sort of delivery system
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.120]   so that we can have all that we want.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.520]   The second part of bad news is,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.580]   in this estranged relationship we have with God,
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.920]   there's absolutely nothing we can do to fix it.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.720]   You can try as hard as you want, you can't do anything.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.420]   It is broken beyond repair, but here's the good news.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.760]   God became a man.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.220]   His name is Jesus.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.880]   He lived the only perfect life that's ever been lived.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.260]   And then he went to the cross,
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.280]   our perfect, blameless substitute,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.340]   and he died in our place.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.220]   He died the death that you and I deserve to die.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.380]   The grave can contain him.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.980]   He's risen from the bed, bodily, physically,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.340]   at the right hand of the Father,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:51.940]   and God offers us, through Jesus, reconciliation.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.740]   God takes this sentence that's been proclaimed over us,
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.940]   has condemned, and estranged, and said,
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.180]   "I reverse that now.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.960]   "I am going to take your sin and put it on Jesus.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.680]   "I'm gonna take the righteousness of Jesus
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.140]   "and give it to you as a free gift.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.580]   "Will you receive it by faith?"
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.660]   And you and I, through the blood of Jesus,
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.780]   the Bible tells us, without the shedding of blood
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.340]   there is no forgiveness of sin.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.440]   You and I, through the blood of Jesus,
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.500]   we can be made right with God.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.900]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.800]   We can be reconciled with God.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.140]   That's the message of the Bible.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.420]   That's the message of those of us in the room
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.500]   who follow Jesus.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.220]   That's the message of the porch.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.400]   That's what we just sang about.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.380]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.780]   That's what we're gonna leave with.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.940]   That's the good news we have for the broken world today.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.200]   Be reconciled to God.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.900]   It's possible.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.260]   The worst thing that could ever happen to you has happened.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.500]   You're unreconciled to God, but the good news is
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.740]   God offers you reconciliation through Jesus.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.740]   Will you turn away from living a life independent of God
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.100]   and will you turn and run to Jesus and trust in him?
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.340]   Will you do that tonight?
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.900]   Maybe you're here tonight in this room.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.520]   Maybe you're joining us online.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.220]   And if you were really honest, you would say,
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.860]   "You know, Dave, I am not reconciled with God.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.820]   "We're not okay.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.580]   "I know we have a broken relationship.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.400]   "It's estranged.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.000]   "I now realize there's nothing I can do to fix it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.720]   "If you're in that place and I, oh, run to Jesus."
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.400]   He loves you.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.680]   He's willing to receive you.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.240]   He is willing to take your sin from you
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.200]   and in exchange give you his right
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.800]   standing before the Father forever.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Would you take him up on that offer tonight?
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.960]   Would you trust in him?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.700]   When we think about reconciliation,
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.400]   I want you to think through four levels.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.080]   If you've never read a guy named John Perkins, you should.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.560]   He has an amazing story.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.160]   He speaks a lot about reconciliation.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.280]   John Perkins was born in rural Mississippi in 1930.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.240]   His parents died quickly after he was born.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.440]   He was raised by his grandparents that were sharecroppers.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.200]   And being a young black man in the South,
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.520]   his family said, "You've got to get out of here.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.880]   "This isn't a safe place for you."
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.540]   So he ended up in California.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.920]   He came to know Jesus and he has spent his entire life
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.840]   talking about reconciliation.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.560]   He would say that through the cross of Jesus,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.100]   there's four levels of reconciliation.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.560]   The first is what we just talked about.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.720]   Through Jesus and his blood,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.040]   you and I can be reconciled to God.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   That relationship that's broken can be repaired forever.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.760]   But that's not the only place reconciliation happens.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.560]   Through the cross of Jesus,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.160]   we can be reconciled to each other.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.480]   I get to serve here on Monday nights, this very same space,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.600]   and we get to see reconciliation happen all the time.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.040]   And it's the craziest stories.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.840]   People do horrible things to people.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.640]   Have you realized that yet?
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.600]   Maybe sadly, you've been the recipient of that.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.840]   Maybe you have been the perpetrator in that.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.080]   There's not a week that goes by that we don't hear of
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.040]   unfaithful spouses being reconciled one to another.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.240]   There's not a month that goes by that we don't get to see
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.360]   a child that was abused by a parent
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.480]   be reconciled to that parent.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.600]   We get to see friends who betrayed each other
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.200]   and hurt one another come back together.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   We get to see the most amazing acts
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.560]   of forgiveness and reconciliation.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.120]   How is that all possible?
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.040]   It's through the blood of Jesus.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.080]   It's because God forgives us in Jesus
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.200]   and because his forgiveness is so thorough, so pervasive,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.760]   you and I can extend that same forgiveness one to another.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.720]   So four levels of reconciliation.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.200]   The first is people to God, people to people.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.320]   Then you see this other level of reconciliation,
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.360]   the Bible, I love this.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.480]   It's people groups to people groups.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.520]   Don't you love that?
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   In the anthropology of the New Testament,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.520]   there's only two kinds of people in the world.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.280]   There are those that come from Jewish heritage
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.880]   and everybody else is considered a Gentile.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.360]   And those two groups of people did not like each other
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.720]   in the ancient culture of the Bible.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.600]   They were at odds.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.800]   Yet when the church was formed, guess what happened?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.720]   Jews were reconciled as a people group to Gentiles.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.280]   How did that happen?
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.520]   Through Jesus.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.880]   Think about what that could look like in our world today.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.520]   Could you imagine a world where men
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.880]   are reconciled to women?
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.480]   How about white people being reconciled
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.160]   to non-white people?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.840]   Let's take it even deeper.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.200]   How about Democrats being reconciled to Republicans?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.760]   You wanna blow your mind tonight?
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.600]   What if Aggies could be reconciled
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.560]   to Longhorns through Jesus Christ?
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.400]   Whoa!
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.200]   Some of you need to repent and believe.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.000]   I hear that, isn't it?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.760]   It's always the Aggies too, I'm sorry.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.080]   But man, you talk about a people group far from God.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   It's all right, nobody's beyond his reach.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   Nobody's finding an Aggie and share the gospel tonight,
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.760]   would you?
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:53.520]   Jesus is our message.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.840]   Let's go back to Flo.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.880]   So I'm there in Flo's store.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.320]   And I leave the day thinking like,
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.520]   "Oh, she's so close to coming to know Jesus.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.080]   "Her heart is so tender."
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.680]   So I go home, sleep on it, wake up the next morning,
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.560]   and I just have this sense.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.720]   I don't know if it's from the Holy Spirit
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.040]   or spiritual indigestion.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.720]   Sometimes it's hard to discern, but I'm like,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.800]   "Today's the day that Flo meets Jesus."
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.080]   So I walked up to her store.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.760]   I waited for there to be an opening.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.920]   I walked in.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.360]   I said, "Flo, do you wanna trust Jesus today?"
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.720]   And she began to tear up.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.640]   And I thought, "Okay, that's a good sign."
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.960]   She said, "Oh, I'm so close, but I don't know."
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.600]   I said, "Okay, let's talk about the gospel again."
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.280]   And we went over it, and she agreed with everything.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.760]   God is a holy God, and I'm a sinner separated from him,
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.240]   and the only way I can know him
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.680]   and be forgiven is through Jesus.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.480]   And I walked through all the presuppositions of the gospel.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.800]   She said, "I believe, I believe, I believe."
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.760]   And I said, "Why not trust him today?"
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.040]   And she began to weep.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.360]   She said, "I just can't."
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.040]   And I said, "Flo, I don't understand.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.760]   "You profess to believe all the tenets of the gospel.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.540]   "Why not trust Jesus today?
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.120]   "Why not give your life to Jesus?"
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.400]   She looked at me through tears, and this is what she said.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.060]   She said, "Dave, I am so ready to become a Christian.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.460]   "I'm just not ready yet to be a Republican."
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.360]   Flo, Flo, like, "Where did you see that in the Bible?"
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.080]   Please tell me.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.520]   Where did, you know, what,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   what intertestinal book does that come from?
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.240]   What is happening?
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.400]   And you know what she said?
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.320]   She said, "It's not in the Bible."
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.200]   But she said, "I've been watching Facebook posts."
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.480]   Back then it was Twitter.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.400]   "Twitter posts, Instagram.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.780]   "I've been watching the people that go to your church,
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.160]   "and my understanding from them is
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.820]   "you've got to be a Republican to be a Christian.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.100]   "Listen to me, friends.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.680]   "I want us to be politically active.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.740]   "I think we have a responsibility to love and serve
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.420]   "people that are marginalized.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.860]   "I think that's the calling of the gospel.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   "I think the gospel has application.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.880]   "We're to care for the unborn.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.980]   "We're to care for the vulnerable.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.520]   "We're to care for the poor.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.900]   "We're to care for the widow and the orphan.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.140]   "We're to care for the sojourner.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.280]   "We're absolutely to do all that,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.180]   "and we need to speak into culture.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.820]   "We need to speak into it.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.440]   "But let's not hijack our main message.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.120]   "The primary message that you and I should be majoring on
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   "is be reconciled to God through Jesus."
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.460]   Friends, are we living on message tonight?
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.560]   Here's what I want you to see as we wrap up.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.480]   Jesus is our meaning.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.880]   Jesus is our mission, and Jesus is our message.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   That's who Jesus is to us.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.840]   This is why this passage is my favorite passage
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.920]   in all of scripture.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.640]   But if these things are true,
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.420]   and I firmly believe they are
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.220]   because they're right on the Bible,
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:10.300]   then I think it's worth building our lives
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.960]   around knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.340]   What might that look like?
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.760]   There's a book that went around about 15 years ago.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.380]   Every now and then a new book comes through the church
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.640]   that everybody says, "Hey, you gotta read this.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.520]   "This is amazing.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.680]   "This will change your life."
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.720]   And then it passes quickly,
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   and this was one of those books.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.240]   It was called "Blue Like Jazz."
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.160]   Maybe you're old and you read it.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   A guy named Donald Miller wrote it.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.000]   It's not a bad book.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.760]   It's just, it was a fad book.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.240]   But in this book, he tells this story that I really love.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.080]   Listen to it.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.640]   He says, "A guy I knew named Alan went around the country
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.180]   "asking ministry leaders questions.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.280]   "He went to successful churches
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.640]   "and asked the pastors what they were doing
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.100]   "and why what they were doing was working.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.280]   "It sounded very boring."
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.120]   I agree.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.200]   "For one visit, except for one visit he made
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.180]   "to a man named Bill Bright,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.920]   "the president of a big ministry.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.380]   "Alan said he was a big man full of life
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.160]   "who listened without shifting his eyes.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.400]   "Alan asked a few questions.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.240]   "I don't know what they were, but as a final question,
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   "he asked Dr. Bright what Jesus meant to him.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.740]   "Alan said Dr. Bright could not answer the question.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.720]   "He said Dr. Bright just started to cry.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.820]   "He sat there in his big chair behind his big desk
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.940]   "and wept.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.420]   "When Alan told that story,
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.080]   "I wondered what it was like to love Jesus that way.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.120]   "I knew that I would like to know Jesus like that
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.040]   "with my heart, not just my head.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.340]   "I felt like that would be the key to something, friends.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.320]   "That's the key to everything."
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.740]   As we close tonight,
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.140]   I wanna invite you to build your life
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:59.120]   entirely around knowing Jesus.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.380]   The simplest way to begin,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.020]   if you don't know where to start,
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.460]   before you go to bed tonight,
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.820]   as you wake up tomorrow,
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.340]   open up your Bible,
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.400]   pick a gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.700]   and just begin to read,
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.660]   and just ask Jesus to make himself known to you.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.180]   A relationship with God is different
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.400]   than a relationship with a person,
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.580]   but there are some similarities.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.220]   And the way that we get to know Jesus
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.540]   is through conversation.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   Jesus speaks to us through his word and his spirit,
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.980]   and you and I respond to him in prayer.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.260]   Will you build your life around knowing Jesus?
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.100]   Let's pray.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.680]   (gentle music)
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:54.060]   Lord Jesus, thank you that you give our lives meaning.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.580]   Thank you that you give our lives purpose,
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.020]   and that you call us to a mission of making you known,
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.060]   of knowing you, and making you known to the nations.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.140]   Thank you that you give us a message to lead with,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.260]   that people can be reconciled to God and each other
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.700]   through who you are and what you've done.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.140]   Lord, I pray for my friends tonight.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.340]   I pray for those that are hurting and struggling,
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.980]   that they would find comfort in you, Jesus.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.960]   I pray for those that are trying to make sense
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.460]   of what's happening, that they would make sense
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.420]   of all that they see in their lives
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.340]   through the lens of you, Jesus.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.640]   I pray for those that are looking for direction
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.660]   and guidance as to what to do next with their lives,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.360]   that they would find purpose in your mission.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.820]   Lord, I pray for those who've not yet believed
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.980]   that tonight they would hear the clear message,
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.220]   you can be reconciled to God through Jesus.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.060]   Will you believe?
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.780]   Lord Jesus, you are the creator of all things.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.540]   All things were created by you, through you,
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.060]   and ultimately for you.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.820]   We want to live our lives completely and entirely
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.600]   for your glory, together in your good name we pray, amen.
