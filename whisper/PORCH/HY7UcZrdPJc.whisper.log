[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.900]   Wish that I could dance alone.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:35.340]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.140]   Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.340]   Let me hear from you.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340]   Man, so glad you are here.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.240]   Man, I hope you know we never take for granted an evening
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.940]   where we get to gather together, not only here
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.260]   in the city of Dallas, but all across the nation
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.380]   in our Porch Life location.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.500]   So thanks for trusting us with your time,
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.300]   joining us here tonight.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.380]   Special shout out to Porch Life Boise, Porch Life Scottsdale.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.300]   Love you guys.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.940]   Thanks for being a part of what God is doing here,
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.620]   as well as there, as well as all of our other Porch Life
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.740]   locations.
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.620]   Hey, just a few years ago, I decided
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.900]   to take up a new pastime.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.100]   I decided to take up the game of golf.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240]   Show of hands, anybody taking up the game of golf as of recent?
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.660]   It's sweeping the nation.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.340]   Yeah, I don't really understand why.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.620]   A few years ago, it was COVID.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.340]   And so I knew I needed to find some way
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.920]   to pass the time in my own personal isolation.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.260]   And so I thought this would be a great use of it.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.940]   And so I set off to learn what is a really difficult sport.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.380]   If you've never played it, what you need to know
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.500]   is this is anything but an easy game.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.620]   Like we've all played mini golf.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.260]   It's hard.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.500]   That's a microcosm of how much more difficult
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.820]   the game of golf actually is.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.500]   And yet I thought, sure, you know what?
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.700]   I'm willing to take this challenge on.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.920]   Like I'll forge my own path to greater golf glory,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.540]   even if it means I have to do so by myself.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.300]   And so I set out to do it.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.920]   I decided that I was going to teach myself
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.620]   because here's the thing, the game is extremely difficult.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.980]   What you need to know is it requires you to refine
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.380]   a very specific skillset over the course
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.780]   of a really long time.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.620]   That's the point.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100]   And you should do so with the help of instruction.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100]   But because it was COVID and everybody's social distancing,
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.180]   there was no instruction for me to be able to find.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.020]   I couldn't do it.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.820]   So I had to do it all by myself.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.020]   So how did I do it?
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.320]   How did I make my way through the game of golf?
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.240]   I did it like this.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.660]   I would go and I would play.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.980]   I would identify what was broken in my game,
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.520]   which was a lot.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   And then I would come back home
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.680]   and I would type into YouTube whatever my issue was.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.280]   I would listen to a variety of online coaches
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.800]   tell me their proposed solution.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.400]   And then I would get back out there and I'd try it again.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.640]   And I would rinse and repeat the process
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.060]   over and over and over again.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.920]   What do you think happened to my game?
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.440]   It didn't get any better,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.420]   but I got a lot busier, I'll tell you.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.040]   You know, I had plenty of different proposals
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.200]   to get out there and try.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.160]   Different of many different options
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.780]   that had been offered to me that I should go out
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.000]   and I should try to apply to improve my game.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.220]   But I was not improving.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.040]   I was only getting worse.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.580]   And so my in-laws intervened.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.340]   They decided after having watched me struggle
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.820]   for a couple of years time that at last it made sense
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940]   for me to go and see a golf instructor,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.380]   a certified golf coach.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.840]   And so they bought me as a gift,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220]   a 30 minute private lesson, which I'll be honest.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.840]   I received, it was extremely kind of them,
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.660]   but it felt like too little too late.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.820]   You know, I mean, it's 30 minute lesson.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.620]   I, by this point have consumed hundreds of hours of videos.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.740]   I have listened to dozens of online coaches
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.940]   and I have spent plenty of money playing this game.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.100]   What is a 30 minute lesson
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.420]   and your special certified golf instructor
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.580]   going to tell me that I don't already know?
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.020]   But hey, what I had to lose, you know,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.220]   I wasn't getting any better.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.100]   So I decided to take the lesson.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100]   I made my way out to the course.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.220]   I met the instructor.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.380]   I hit a couple of balls for the guy
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.100]   where immediately he stops the practice.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.580]   He pulls me over to the side.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580]   He looks right into my eyes and he goes,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.020]   "There are a couple of things you need to know
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.860]   about this game.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.020]   Number one, it's much easier than people think.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.820]   Number two, you are making it much harder
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.860]   than it needs to be.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.740]   Forget everything you've learned
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.620]   and listen to my voice alone."
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.060]   And so I did.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.540]   I continued through the practice.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.020]   He showed me a variety of different things
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.820]   and by way of applying myself,
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.860]   not to all of these different competing voices,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.600]   but merely listening to the one voice
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.460]   that actually knew what it looked like to grow.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.160]   You know what happened to my game?
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.860]   It did.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.780]   It got better.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.860]   It's not great, but it did get better.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.940]   (congregation applauding)
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.900]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900]   Because as we journey through life
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.260]   and we mature along the way,
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.980]   there are so many competing voices telling us
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.220]   how we should do it.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.060]   Like how we should progress as a human being,
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.060]   how we should advance as individuals.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.860]   So many so-called experts all propositioning us
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.340]   to follow their philosophy,
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.180]   to trust their teaching, to endorse their ideology,
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.460]   they're trying to get us to follow them
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.800]   because they know the way for us to grow.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.500]   They know what it looks like for us to get better.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.640]   They know what it looks like for us
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.740]   to achieve all of our hopes and dreams here in this life.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.060]   And yet, as we listen to all of these different voices
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.140]   and as we put into practice
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.900]   all of these different proposals, what happens?
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.420]   Life doesn't get better.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.560]   It just gets busier.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.260]   That's what happens.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.100]   Why?
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.860]   Why is that the case?
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.100]   Because many may promise a fuller experience in this life,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.860]   but only one whose name is Jesus Christ
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.500]   can actually deliver on that promise.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.540]   Many different voices may propose to you,
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.100]   hey, this is the way to fuller life.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.020]   This is the way to grow here in your time on earth.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.420]   But only one can actually deliver on that promise.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.120]   That's what the book of Colossians is all about.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.500]   So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.220]   Last week, we introduced that over the course
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.980]   of the next several weeks,
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.380]   we are going to be journeying
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.480]   through the book of Colossians together.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.340]   And so we're gonna take it from the very beginning
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.380]   to the very end.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.860]   We're gonna go line by line, page by page,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.820]   and we're gonna journey and understand
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.700]   what is the apostle Paul who authored this letter?
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.300]   What is he writing about?
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.180]   What is his point and his purpose
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.860]   in pinning this little letter to this group of believers
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.740]   in a city known as Colossae?
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.780]   What was his point?
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.620]   So let's set it up with some context.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.220]   What you need to know is that he was writing
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.940]   to a group of young believers in a city called Colossae.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.020]   Colossae wasn't an especially large city
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.740]   at the time that Paul was writing to it,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.740]   but what it was, was especially diverse.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.340]   It was diverse ethnically.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.540]   There were Phrygians as well as Greeks
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.660]   and some Jews living there within the city.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.100]   And it was also ethnic, it was also diverse philosophically,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.460]   which actually raises the issue
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.580]   that Paul is going to address,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.460]   which I'll unpack for you in a minute.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.480]   But what you see is that he's writing
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.500]   to a group of young Christians, young believers,
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.980]   that have placed their faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.980]   that have made the ultimate decision to go all in with God.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.380]   And yet now they're appropriately at a place
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.620]   that many of you may find yourself sitting in.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.700]   What's next?
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.860]   Like, how do I get better?
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.820]   What does it look like for me to advance as an individual,
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.340]   to progress through this life,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.940]   for me to achieve all the fullness of God,
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.300]   all the fullness that God is offering me
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.740]   while I'm here on this earth?
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.140]   How do I do it?
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.460]   What steps do I take from here?
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.780]   This is the question these believers are asking,
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.300]   and you may be asking yourself.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.780]   And to these believers,
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.380]   this backdrop of Colossae,
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.020]   a city diverse in philosophy and ideology
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.980]   and riddled with so much different tradition
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.740]   begins to permeate the walls of their community
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.800]   and tell them what it looks like to grow
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.120]   in greater spirituality.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.580]   Many competing voices begin to tell them what to do.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.780]   And what you find is an immense amount of confusion.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.020]   Like, they find that they actually don't know
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.980]   how to make sense of what is true and what is not.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.780]   And so Paul, who's in prison, he gets word of this.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.220]   He learns that this is the case
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.580]   for this young group of believers.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   And so he writes this letter to them
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.380]   to clarify for them very specifically with one voice
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.400]   what they need to know,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.180]   what it looks like to grow in Christ like this,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.940]   what it looks like to mature and move forward in life.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.620]   And so what he says,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.320]   and the main idea of this entire letter
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   is that if you want maturity in life,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.740]   you need clarity of Christ.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.900]   That's Paul's point.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.140]   That's what this entire letter is about.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.040]   If you want maturity in life, you need clarity of Christ.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.940]   You don't need spiritual mysticism and special knowledge
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.820]   and some path to a superior existence
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.380]   or some new moral ethic.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.140]   You don't need any of this other stuff
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.980]   that people are telling you.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.140]   What you need is you need greater clarity of him.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.400]   Because if you see more of him, you'll see more of yourself.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.960]   We just walked through a series called Essential
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.340]   where we unpacked what?
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.860]   The one thing that God wants most for you,
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.700]   which is to see him.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.420]   And the reason we're studying Colossians
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.540]   is because this is the natural next step.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.740]   Now that you see him, what then happens?
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.140]   What then takes place?
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.300]   Your clarity of him produces a maturity in you.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.140]   This is why as Paul writes the book of Colossians,
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.780]   he presents what is quite possibly
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.420]   the Bible's highest Christology in all the scripture.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.060]   He paints a picture of Jesus with an unbridled beauty
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.560]   and out of this world beauty,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.660]   because he wants them and he wants you to know
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.460]   there's no one like him.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.940]   There's plenty and all the more to find within him.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.600]   You just need to see him clearly.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.580]   And in so doing, you'll see yourself.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.460]   That's what he's going to unpack for us.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.460]   He wants to write to a group of young, eager Christians
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.740]   amidst a chaotic and confusing day,
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.180]   the truth that they need to know,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:16.180]   which is that God in the person of Jesus really is above all.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.620]   Which is why I'm so excited for us to read it together,
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.960]   because our room looks a lot like the church in Colossae.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.200]   Like we're a group of young people
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.300]   gathered into one space at one time
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.860]   amidst a chaotic and confusing day,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.060]   amidst a city that is culturally diverse
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.300]   with a variety of philosophy swirling about,
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.240]   wanting and aspiring to grow.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.660]   This letter, it's written for you.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.060]   It's written for me.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.700]   And so we're going to take our time through it.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.980]   Like we're going to walk through this thing
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.060]   from beginning to end.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.780]   And so what we're going to do is start at the very beginning.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.500]   We're going to pick it up in chapter one.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.600]   So if you have a Bible, chapter one, starting in verse one,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.260]   we're going to start where Paul starts.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.500]   Where does Paul start?
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.980]   He starts with some encouragement.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   That's what he does.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.620]   It says, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.380]   by the will of God and Timothy, our brother,
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.220]   to the saints and the faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.360]   grace to you and peace from God our father.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.280]   We always thank God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.620]   when we pray for you,
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.140]   since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.520]   and of the love that you have for all the saints
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.620]   because of the hope laid up for you in heaven."
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.220]   You see, Paul, before he unpacks
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.100]   where these believers need to grow in Christ,
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.940]   and he's going to do it.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.820]   Like there's plenty of room for them to grow.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.380]   There's plenty of ground for them to take
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.920]   before he moves into any of that,
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.500]   any area of opportunity for growth.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.580]   He wants to celebrate the ways
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.060]   that God has already grown them.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.900]   That's what he does.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.820]   That's why he starts with encouragement.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.300]   The porch thing, we do this every single Wednesday.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.660]   Tomorrow, we're going to meet
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.280]   and we're going to talk about what happened tonight.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.420]   But here's what we do.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.780]   At the very beginning of that meeting,
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.860]   before we talk about the work that is ahead,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.420]   we celebrate the work that is behind.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.940]   We tell God's stories to one another.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.800]   Stories where we saw Jesus move amongst us
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.160]   here this evening.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.860]   Stories where we saw the very clear hand of God
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.460]   on the lives of people or upon our team,
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.860]   because we want gratitude to be the platform
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.200]   from which we plan the next week.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.500]   You see, we don't want to work for gratitude.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.100]   We want to work from gratitude.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.740]   Paul's doing the exact same thing.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.900]   He's saying, "Hey, before we talk about all the areas
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.860]   you need to grow, let's just acknowledge
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.420]   God's already grown you so much.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.900]   Like he's already done such a good work in you.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.620]   Let me tell you why, that's where we're going."
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.540]   But what he wants them to see is, man,
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.700]   it's not by way of your personal application
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.700]   that you're going to be able to pull yourself up
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.100]   by your bootstraps and move forward into greater godliness.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.940]   That's not the case.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.100]   No, God has not called you to be successful.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.980]   He's called you to be faithful.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.260]   That's it.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.620]   He's the one that moves the needle, not you.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.900]   He's the one that makes the difference, not you.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.460]   He's the one that leads you forward, not you.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.860]   He is the one that powers the engine of your life
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.380]   and leads you into greater growth, not you.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.900]   So we've got to celebrate what he's already done.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.060]   We need to be encouraged by the fact
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.200]   that God is already at work.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.560]   And so what Paul says is he says,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.540]   "Hey, I've heard of some things about you
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.540]   that are deeply encouraging.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.740]   You have a good reputation."
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.940]   And it's reached my ears all the way over in prison.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.440]   Which actually begs the question,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.640]   how had Paul heard of all of this?
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.040]   Like, sure, they were in a different city,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.460]   separate from Paul,
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.740]   and yet he's heard about their behavior.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.940]   What does that mean?
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.380]   It means that people didn't just notice what they did,
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.140]   they discussed what they did, right?
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.360]   So why do we talk about the things that we notice?
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.000]   Why do we talk about those things which we see
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.120]   that we think other people need to know as well?
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.340]   That she's so pretty,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.000]   or man, that guy is the nicest guy ever,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.080]   or that meal was amazing.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.860]   Why do we do that?
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.120]   Because it's not enough that I know
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.740]   other people need to know.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.420]   That's what I'm going to tell them.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.720]   They have a reputation.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.240]   That's not just, it's not sufficient enough
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.920]   for people to be like, man, they're really awesome.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.720]   No, everybody needs to know
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.600]   that these guys are really great.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.640]   God has done a good work.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.880]   And so Paul's saying, hey, I've heard word.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.200]   I've got wind of your good reputation.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.840]   So what about their good reputation has Paul heard?
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   What can we learn from their example?
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.980]   Well, there's going to be three things.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.240]   But the first thing we see is that Paul heard of their faith.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.200]   That's the very first thing.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.600]   That's what it says in verse three.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.780]   We always thank God when we pray for you,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.420]   since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.420]   Which begs the question,
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.580]   what's so impressive about their faith?
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.420]   Like Paul was always thanking God when he prayed for them.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.500]   He was always thanking God when he prayed for them.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.380]   Why did he have to always thank God when he prayed?
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.540]   Why couldn't he have just thanked God when he prayed?
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.420]   Why always?
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.040]   If you read the Greek, when he prayed,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.380]   that was continually happening.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.620]   So every time he prayed, he was continually thanking God.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.420]   Why does he add the double emphasis of always doing it?
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.180]   He's literally saying, I always thank God when I pray.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.260]   I continually thank God when I continually pray for you.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.380]   Why are you overreacting, Paul?
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.000]   This feels absurd.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.380]   Like these guys, sure, they've got some faith,
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.620]   but why is it something to write home about?
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.460]   Like, why is it the,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.020]   why is the fact that they've placed their faith
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.860]   in Jesus Christ?
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.620]   They've trusted in him for the forgiveness of their sins.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.540]   Why is that so notable?
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.860]   Well, the answer to that question
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.300]   lies in our understanding of what faith is.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.260]   Because the Bible has a very clear definition
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.500]   of what faith actually is.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.680]   And here's the thing.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.780]   So if you're not listening,
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.300]   you're gonna wanna lean in on this.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.880]   I think it's different than what most of us would assume.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.740]   How would you define faith?
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.340]   Like if I walked around the room right now
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.820]   and we passed a microphone by, what would you say?
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.340]   What would you say is true of faith?
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.780]   What would you define it as?
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.220]   We're not gonna do that, but I've done this before.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.620]   And always what I get, it's a wide range of answers,
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.100]   but always what I hear from people is it's,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.380]   it's what you believe.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.620]   That's what faith is.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.440]   It's what you believe.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.060]   It's what you believe about God.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.540]   It's your religious persuasion.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.780]   It's your personal conception of spiritual realities,
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.840]   which isn't inherently wrong, but isn't exactly right.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   You see, what we need to know is that faith,
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.780]   as the Bible defines it,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.840]   is so much more than just what you think about God.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.240]   It's bigger than your mental activity.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.460]   Hebrews 11, one would tell us,
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.980]   now faith is the reality of what is hoped for.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.080]   It's the proof of what is not seen.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.720]   This is probably the single clearest definition
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.400]   in all the Bible of what faith actually is.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.480]   And if you read this verse across different translations,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.120]   there's different words thrown in there,
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.640]   but that translation, the CSB,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.320]   is the closest translation
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.080]   to what the Greek is actually saying.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.620]   It's saying that faith, it's a reality.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.940]   Like it has objectivity to it.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.900]   There's proof behind it.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.860]   There's an evidential element to faith.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.500]   It's not just what do you think about God?
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.180]   What do you believe about God?
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.700]   What do you know about God?
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.260]   It's so much bigger than that,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.940]   which defies our normal expectation.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.420]   Because how do we walk around and asking people
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.380]   what their spiritual persuasion is?
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.300]   What do we say?
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.860]   We don't say, "Hey, what religion do you ascribe to?"
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.700]   We don't say that.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.140]   We say, "Hey, tell me about your faith background."
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.980]   And what do we expect?
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.660]   For people to unpack for us a mental checklist
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.460]   of the things they believe, right?
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.180]   Faith is way bigger.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.180]   Faith is not just a mentality we adopt.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.740]   It's a reality we experience.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.620]   Faith is not just a mentality we adopt.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.200]   It's a reality we experience,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.480]   which I think is so important for us.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.180]   This is a current passion point of mine.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.540]   I learned this a few years ago and it blew my mind.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.660]   And I believe it still to this day.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.660]   So many of us, we treat God like an idea to learn,
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.740]   a concept to study.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.320]   But he's the character of the story.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.460]   Like God is not just distant, dormant, far off God.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.860]   No, he's right here right now.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.500]   Like he's in the room with you.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.900]   Like we don't just talk about, "Man, I believe in God."
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.820]   No, you walk with God.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.180]   He's a person that wants intimate relationship with you.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.300]   He doesn't just want you to be intellectually acquainted
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.140]   with him.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.220]   He wants you to be intimately acquainted with him.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.060]   He wants you to know him.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.540]   It's funny.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.260]   I understand what people say when they're like,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.060]   "Man, I just am studying the character and nature of God."
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.740]   I don't study the character and nature of my wife.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.300]   Like that's not how I talk about her.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.620]   That's not how I treat her.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.580]   Why? Because she's real.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.280]   Now I care deeply about her character.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.960]   I care deeply about her nature.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.520]   But how do I learn those things?
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.800]   By walking with her and talking to her and listening to her
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.300]   and spending time together.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.360]   That's how I learn about my wife
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.120]   because she's a real person.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.320]   God is the same.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.560]   He's not just one we study.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.080]   He's one we enjoy.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.360]   This is what faith is unpacking for us.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.820]   You see, what Paul is trying to present
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.320]   is that Jesus has this mind-blowing beauty.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.000]   Like what the book of Colossians is gonna say
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.440]   is that Jesus is overwhelmingly supreme
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.520]   and he's inexhaustibly sufficient.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.680]   You'll find no higher authority
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.520]   and you'll find no more perfect sustainer,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.560]   provider for your life.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.060]   You need to look nowhere else.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.960]   And yet, if we just hear that
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.880]   and take it as a nugget of insight,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.560]   some new knowledge to learn,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.300]   and it does not impact our life,
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.740]   if all it does is inform our mind
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.420]   but doesn't inflame our heart,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.200]   then this entire series will be a waste.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.360]   That's why we're spending so much time on this
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.980]   because I need you to get this.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.980]   I need you to know that he's real
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.100]   and he's personal and he wants you.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.780]   So when Brooke and I first started dating,
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.240]   I knew all the right things that I was supposed to say,
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.960]   all the right things that I was supposed to do.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.380]   I know what it looked like to be a good Christian guy
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.680]   dating a good Christian girl.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.480]   Like I knew that clarity was really important.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.880]   I knew that I should ask her out on dates
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.560]   and not just to hang out, you know?
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.780]   I knew that purity should be a high priority for us,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.960]   that I should make sure
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.880]   we had mutually agreed upon boundaries,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.640]   we'd established parameters
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.240]   to protect us from any sort of temptation.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.040]   I knew it was important that I continually pursued her,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.120]   that I couldn't just settle for quantity of time,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.260]   but I really needed to fight for quality of time with her.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.400]   I knew how a Christian guy was supposed to conduct himself.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.980]   I had great vision
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.180]   and really good intentions for our relationship.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.160]   But if you ask Brooke, but she's sitting down here,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.120]   she can agree if this is actually true.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.720]   If you asked her for a report
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.920]   on the quality of my leadership during our dating history,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.800]   I'd have anything but straight A's.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   You see, I knew all the facts of what to do,
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.840]   but I didn't live in light of the truth of them.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.780]   Like I had a great dating mentality,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.620]   but a really poor dating reality.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.400]   I wonder how many of us could say
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.960]   the same is true for us tonight, just with respect to faith.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.840]   That our faith mentality, man, it's really good.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.880]   Like I could sit down and I could chop it up
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   with the best of them at the coffee shop.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.520]   I can let them know what I learned in my podcast.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.440]   I can talk to them about what I studied this week.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.560]   And yet though my faith mentality may be so strong,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   my faith reality, it actually could not be any weaker.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:26.320]   You see, for many of us, we have the best of intentions.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.600]   We know all the right things to do,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.040]   but like me and dating, there's a lack of action.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.320]   What you need to know is that faithful believers,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.720]   Faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.880]   The way Jesus unpacks this is he says,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   "You will know a tree by its fruit."
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.840]   You'll know it.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.560]   That's why he curses the barren fig tree.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.440]   It has all the markings of life,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.080]   and yet there's no fruit on it.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.760]   And he says, "That's not real.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.720]   "That's not genuine."
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.440]   Faithful believers are never without faithful behavior.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.040]   We must live, act, speak, move,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.440]   stand in light of what we know.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.560]   You think about it like this.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.120]   Jesus never once asked anyone, "Hey, what is your faith?"
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.040]   Never.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.200]   What did he repeatedly ask?
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.120]   Where is your faith?
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.320]   That's what he was searching for
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.400]   because faith isn't just intellectual, it's experiential.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.720]   It doesn't just change our thinking,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   it changes our living.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.760]   All throughout the gospels, Jesus responds to the faith,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.400]   not that he hears about, that he sees and he knows about.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.700]   Mark 2, three through five says,
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.000]   "And they came bringing to him
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.560]   "a paralytic carried by four men.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.860]   "And when they could not get near him
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.040]   "because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.200]   "And when they had made an opening,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.040]   "they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.620]   "And when Jesus saw their faith,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.040]   "he said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.800]   Their faith was observable.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Matthew 8, 10, "When Jesus heard this,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.440]   "he marveled and said to those who followed him,
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.300]   "Truly I tell you, with no one else in all of Israel
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.800]   "have I found such faith."
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.900]   It was observable.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.360]   Mark 5, 32 through 34,
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.100]   "And he looked around to see who had done it,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.680]   "who had touched him in this story.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.580]   "But the woman, knowing what had happened to her,
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.300]   "that she had been healed of her infirmity,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.440]   "she came in fear, trembling, and fell down before him
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.600]   "and told him the whole truth.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.040]   "And he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith,
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.920]   "which is observable, has made you well.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.220]   "Go in peace and be healed of your diseases.'"
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.760]   You see, these people,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   they did not engage the world by way of what they saw.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   They engaged the world by way of how it should be seen.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.520]   We must do the same.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.120]   This is what it looks like to be genuinely faithful
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.520]   as we walk with God.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.680]   Like these people, their lives were not dictated
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.440]   by the circumstances of this world.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.840]   Like bleeding discharge for 15 years,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.980]   born crippled, overwhelming disease,
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.240]   their lives were not dictated
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.900]   by the circumstances of this world.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.160]   Their lives were dictated by the evidences of another world
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.280]   that God had broken into the story,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   that God from on high had become Jesus here down low,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.400]   and he was engaging with them right where they were.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   And it changed everything
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.240]   about the way they engaged the world.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   Brooke and I, just yesterday, we were walking in a park
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.520]   and we were looking at the trees around us,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.920]   and we called to mind what we know,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.480]   what the right mentality is.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.040]   And it said of our reality,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.560]   these trees are groaning in eager anticipation
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.920]   for the sons of glory to be revealed.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.560]   They're clapping in praise to God.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.800]   It changed the way we looked at the world.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.440]   We did not see it as it was.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.600]   We saw it as it should be seen.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.820]   So to let it be true of you.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.900]   This is what Paul first recognizes
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.920]   about these believers in Colossae.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.660]   He looks at me and says, "Man, your faith, it's amazing."
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.540]   But he doesn't just stop there.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.380]   He keeps going.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.200]   He says in verse three,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.080]   "We've not only heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.040]   we've heard of your love for all the saints."
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.400]   Which again, feels kind of anticlimactic.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.720]   As believers, like loving people
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.640]   is just part of the territory.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.920]   You know, this is kind of what we do.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.840]   We go around and we love other people.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.600]   Jesus loves, so we love as well.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.660]   And yet what we need to understand
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.840]   is why this is a big deal to Paul.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.200]   So in the English language,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.240]   when we try to communicate love,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.180]   we have one word to communicate
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.020]   a variety of different usages.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.840]   So just to make this really plain,
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.880]   if I came up to you and I said,
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.520]   "Hey, your boyfriend loves you and loves pizza."
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.340]   We'd hope that those are not synonymous types of love.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.980]   Yes?
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.780]   If so, we've got a bigger problem on our hands.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.500]   But what we would likely be getting to
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.100]   is that this same word is used to communicate a variety,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.940]   a wide range of different affection.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.400]   This is not a problem in Greek.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.120]   In Greek, they don't have one word for love.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.660]   They have four words for love.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.880]   Four different words.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.120]   The first word is the word storge.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.660]   Storge is familial love.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.300]   It's between a mother and a child, brother and a sister.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.860]   The second word is phileo.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.180]   This is friendship love.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.500]   It's brotherly affection.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.860]   Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.780]   Phileo, Delphia.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.260]   Eros is the third one.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.140]   This is romantic or passionate love.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.000]   And then the fourth is well-known.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.840]   It's agape,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.640]   which is sacrificial or unconditional love.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.220]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.660]   Of these four loves,
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.980]   agape is different than all the rest.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.820]   It's unique.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.540]   It's distinct from every other one.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.380]   Why? How so?
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.060]   Why is it different from all the other ones?
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.300]   Because all the other ones,
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.060]   they're emotionally driven, right?
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.900]   Romantic love is like, oh my gosh,
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.740]   like where's my love?
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.700]   I must go to them.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.220]   That's the way that Eros expresses itself.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.580]   Or a mother, when she has her newborn,
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.540]   there's just a natural gravitation,
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.180]   a pull, a magnetism to love that child.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.580]   Agape, it's not emotionally driven.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.460]   It's consciously driven.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.740]   It's not a love of feeling.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.060]   It's a love of choice.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.060]   It's not reactive.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.140]   It's resilient.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.540]   It's a resilient type of love
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.780]   because it does not love in light of anything you do.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.540]   It loves despite everything you do.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.900]   This is the heart of agape.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.900]   And Paul, as he's writing to these believers in Colossae,
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.220]   guess what kind of love he's celebrating about them?
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.060]   Agape.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.420]   A love that is most uncharacteristically true of humanity
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.660]   and yet most quintessentially true of God.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.860]   That's what he's saying.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   He's saying you're loving all the saints within your city
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.640]   with a kind of love that is not of this world,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.940]   but is of a different one.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.940]   You see, to put all of this in a sentence,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.820]   what Paul is trying to say is that godly love
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.360]   is not just an instinctual feeling,
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.420]   but an intentional choice.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.940]   Godly love is not just an instinctual feeling,
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.400]   it's an intentional choice.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.180]   It's the kind of love that they have.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.520]   And it's the kind of love they made a reputation for.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.360]   Why is that?
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.560]   Well, as we go on, what we see is that this love
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.480]   is very characteristically dispensed,
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.680]   not just to those whom they are like,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.980]   but to all people, regardless of background,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.460]   regardless of economic status,
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.140]   regardless of their spiritual persuasion.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.020]   Like they are all united together
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.860]   because of this kind of love.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.340]   First John 4, eight through nine says,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.180]   "Anyone who does not love does not know God."
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.560]   Why? Because God is love.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.300]   What kind of love?
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.580]   The kind of love that would send his only son into the world
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.460]   so that we might live through him.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.620]   A kind of love that is sacrificing.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.340]   A kind of love that's intentional.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.740]   This is a love that's very unlike our own.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.940]   So let me just explain it like this.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.780]   Think about the people
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.180]   that you're naturally drawn towards in life.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.340]   Even the people that you're sitting around right now,
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.260]   that you came with tonight,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.980]   you're sitting beside this evening.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.900]   Who are you naturally drawn towards in life?
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.160]   What's true of them?
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.440]   Well, for lack of a better word, they're lovable.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:34.260]   There's something about them that you personally enjoy.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.660]   Like you see them and what you see
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.140]   is a really good return on investment.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.660]   Like a really deep sense of joy by way of their presence.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.900]   Like you find that they're really easy to spend time with,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.540]   or they're really funny, or man, they're really attractive
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.620]   and I like being around that.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.300]   You know, like you see in them
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.020]   a variety of different things
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.580]   that help you to feel like, man,
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.420]   there's a benefit to being near them.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:03.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.340]   These are the people we draw near to.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.340]   Think about the people Jesus drew near to.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.140]   What kind of people did Jesus draw near to?
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:20.140]   Adulterers, addicts, blasphemers, bigots.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:28.660]   Jesus did not draw near to lovable, beautiful people.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.260]   He drew near to unlovable, broken people.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.480]   This is what agape love does.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.120]   You see, Jesus loved with a love
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.020]   that was unlike the world's, but just like God's.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.780]   One that was non-instinctual, but intentional.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.660]   And because the believers that Paul's writing to
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.220]   have been loved with a love like this,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.380]   they love with a love like this.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.740]   It's the natural outflow.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.260]   I've received this, and now the natural response
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.500]   is to give this to other people.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.700]   The Bible would say so itself.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.300]   John 13, 34 says, "By this, all men will know
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.080]   "that you're my disciples.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.060]   "You'll stand out if you have love for one another."
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.280]   First John 3, 10, "By this, the children of God
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.000]   "and the children of the devil are obvious.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.060]   "Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.780]   "nor the one who does not love his brother."
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.100]   You see, those that have been loved by God,
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.300]   they love like God.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.260]   It's our trademark, our unique signature on life.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.380]   We don't just love by feeling, we love by choice.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.220]   We bite our tongue when our words would hurt.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.360]   We patiently endure when our friends are cruel.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.120]   We forgive an enemy that's done us wrong.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.420]   We do what's right when everybody else
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.820]   chooses to do what's wrong.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.900]   This is the kind of love that genuine believers in Christ
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.040]   are marked by.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.160]   And it's the kind of love that the world takes notice of,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.660]   because it's not characteristically true of anybody else,
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.100]   but our God.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.500]   And Paul's saying, "Hey, you'll have an amazing faith,
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.340]   "a faith that's not just full of the right mentality,
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.300]   "but is actually expressing the right reality."
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.420]   But not just that, you have a love
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.220]   that doesn't look like the world's, but looks like God's.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.020]   That doesn't do unto others as they have done unto you,
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.980]   but does unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.660]   But he doesn't just stop there.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.620]   As he keeps going, Paul tells them
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.900]   that there's one more thing which I've heard.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.780]   And he unpacks it in verse five.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.260]   He says, "Because of the hope laid up for you in heaven,
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.760]   "of this you have heard before the word of the truth,
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.540]   "the gospel which has come to you as indeed,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.820]   "in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.340]   "as it also does among you, since the day you heard it
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.640]   "and understood the grace of God in truth."
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.820]   You see, Paul, he addresses here
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.140]   towards the end of his introduction,
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.440]   one final notable characteristic
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.040]   of the Christians in Colossae that he's learned of,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   which is their hope.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.140]   That's the last thing.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.940]   Paul, in his opening introduction,
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.340]   identifies three notable characteristics
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.780]   about these believers.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.940]   You know what they are?
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:09.700]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:16.020]   He identifies the holy triad.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.740]   He looks at them and says,
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.360]   "You have all the markings of God on your life.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.620]   "You have all the markings of God on your life."
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.100]   Which again, begs the question for us,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.020]   why is he celebrating the hope they have in heaven?
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.740]   Like Paul, we get it, man.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.580]   You know what?
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.460]   You're celebrating their faith,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.420]   which at first seemed a little bit obvious,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.940]   but then again, we realized faith
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.060]   isn't exactly what we thought.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:37.880]   And you know what?
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.860]   You were celebrating their love,
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.220]   but love's kind of the natural outflow
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.660]   of the Christian life.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.680]   But we get it.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.520]   It's a different kind of love.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.940]   It's a godly type of love.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.780]   But why are you celebrating their hope in heaven?
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.700]   Like that's just part of the process.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.320]   That's kind of formulaic to the Christian experience.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.840]   You place your faith in Jesus,
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.320]   and then what you get is eternal life.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.640]   That's on the other side of this agreement.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.540]   Why, Paul, are you celebrating it?
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:05.880]   Well, we need to understand the kind of hope
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.000]   that Paul's very specifically speaking to.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   You see, Paul does know that the free gift of God
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.640]   is eternal life in Christ Jesus
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.860]   for those that have placed their faith in him.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.640]   But he's saying that this hope
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.020]   is not just a hope that's looking forward to the future,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.520]   but it's fueling them right now.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.820]   That's what he's getting at.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:32.180]   See, Paul is teaching us from their example
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.460]   that hope is not just an anticipation of tomorrow,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.240]   it's a motivation for today.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.700]   Hope is not just an anticipation of tomorrow,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.500]   but it's a motivation for today.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   Like he's addressing the fact that, man,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.540]   y'all are looking forward to one day
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.120]   when you will be with God.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.400]   You are anticipating the fact that you will be in heaven
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.760]   at some point in the future,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.400]   but your faith and your love,
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.300]   it's rooted in the fact that you have that hope right now.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.520]   It's not just something that's looking forward,
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.560]   it's fueling you right now.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.520]   It's motivating your life here in the present.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.080]   So just as an example,
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.640]   when I received the offer to come here to the porch,
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.320]   Brooke and I, we had about a month of time
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.520]   between the time at which I was offered the job
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.320]   and we signed the letter to when we moved
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.440]   and I had my first day.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.400]   We had a month.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.640]   When we signed the offer, we had a sealed promise.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.360]   We had a hope laid up for us in Dallas.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.160]   We knew that we were coming here.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.040]   We had all the anticipation of arriving here in the future.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.640]   We knew that we would be amongst our friends
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.240]   and we would have the chance to spend time
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.560]   with our family here in the city.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.400]   And we'd get the chance to be a part of this ministry
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.000]   and see the way God is moving.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.320]   We anticipated all of it,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.520]   but it wasn't just something we looked forward to.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.760]   It also impacted how we live
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.180]   within the month we had left in Houston.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.440]   Right?
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.600]   What did it do?
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.440]   It unleashed us to make the most of the time we had left.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.720]   Like we were anticipating something great
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.320]   and so it motivated us in the present.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.600]   We had conversations, the likes of which we'd put off.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.840]   And yet now time was of the essence.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.240]   We need to share the gospel.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.760]   We need to commission others.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.320]   We need to challenge their faith.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.120]   We need to admonish the faithful.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.840]   We need to do all of these different things
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.780]   to call people into the light of the gospel
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.360]   that we ourselves had received.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.440]   And now we ourselves were going to proclaim.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.640]   But not just that, it allowed us to take deep interest
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.880]   in investing in the relationships God had given.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.160]   Like we would sit at dinners
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.560]   and we would linger in conversation
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.200]   and we would take time with friends
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.580]   and we would celebrate what God had done.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.520]   Because we had a hope ahead,
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.200]   it caused us to have great investment where we were.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.800]   Even Tim McGraw gets this.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.000]   "Live like you were dying."
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.040]   You know?
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.000]   He's like, "Yeah, man."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.840]   Like a vision of your pending doom,
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.860]   your expiration is going to motivate you right now
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.080]   in the present.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.480]   So go skydive, go rock climb,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.920]   go 2.7 seconds on "Bullet and Fu Manchu."
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.200]   Like get out there and do it.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.400]   That's what he's unpacking.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.000]   And Paul is saying the same thing is true
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.280]   when we have a hope laid up for us in heaven.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.640]   We know, man, there's something glorious ahead.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.800]   And that doesn't make me anxious about today.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.600]   That unleashes me today.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.880]   Hope of a promised future unleashes you
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.760]   to make the most of your present reality.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.840]   Hope of a promised future, promised.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.960]   It's not just preferred, that'd be really great.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.080]   It's a promised future.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.680]   Jesus Christ went to the cross and rose from the dead
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.080]   to secure the fact that we'd be with God forever.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.920]   It's a promise.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.880]   We're going to the pearly gates.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.960]   We're going to be with God in eternity.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.320]   And it's going to be glorious.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.560]   We're going to get to be with all of our besties.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.200]   But it's not just that it's a promised future
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.980]   that we look forward to.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.860]   It's a present reality upon which we're unleashed.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.040]   You see, this is what is different about Christianity
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.400]   than the rest of the world.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:17.080]   In the face of inevitable death,
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.880]   the rest of the world has no hope to offer.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.320]   No hope that is promised the way we've described.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.680]   Sure, other religiosity would say,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.360]   there's a preferred future, but you got to get to it.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.040]   You got to work your way.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.840]   You got to work from the sweat of your brow
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.320]   to get to that preferred end.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:44.800]   But Christianity, the faith we have in Jesus
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.080]   does not sweat nor worry or feel any concern
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.040]   that this is the case.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.480]   Because we don't have to ascend to God,
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.880]   for God has descended to us.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.240]   He has stepped into our story.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.760]   And in so doing, He has given us a remarkable hope.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.120]   A hope that we not only look forward to one day,
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.000]   but we enjoy and we experience here today.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.840]   In 1683, John Owen, who was a great Puritan,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.240]   he was laying on his deathbed
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.320]   and he was having his secretary write a note
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.460]   to one of his dear friends.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.620]   And as she began to pen the letter,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.640]   she wrote out from John to his friend,
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.320]   "I'm still in the land of the living."
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.680]   He's on his deathbed, he's providing an update.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.720]   And so she writes, "I'm still in the land of the living."
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.520]   Upon hearing it, John said, "Stop.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:42.960]   "Don't say that, change that and say instead,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.220]   "I'm yet in the land of the dying.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.340]   "But I hope soon to be in the land of the living."
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:57.760]   You and I may not be laying on our deathbed quite like John,
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   but friends, we are urgently expiring.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.600]   Which is a really heavy thing to think about.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.960]   You know, some of you, you're here for the first time,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.240]   you're like, wow, that's how this guy's gonna wrap it up?
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.400]   That's where he's gonna land the plane?
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.440]   I told you we shouldn't have come here.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.800]   Why didn't we go get food?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.300]   You know, like that's a really heavy place to end.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.080]   But it does beg the question,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.640]   what are you hoping in tonight?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.100]   Like what do you think if you achieve it,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.660]   it'll give you security, purpose, meaning?
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.480]   Is it your job?
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.700]   That thing which you want so badly to be a part of,
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.400]   yet you're already planning to retire from it today.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.740]   Is it your relationship?
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.100]   Despite the fact that I've stood in the altar
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.880]   of multiple weddings and I've listened to people
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.260]   make vows and account for the worst
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.660]   of the other person's self.
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:07.780]   Is it your friends?
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.900]   Because statistically, most friendships won't last
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.680]   beyond 10 years in total length.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.280]   Is it your beauty?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.980]   Yeah, gravity's never lost that one.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.860]   Is it your platform?
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.980]   Your popularity?
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:34.100]   Even though on that platform,
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.940]   you're only as valuable to people
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.660]   as the performance you keep up.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:46.940]   What are you searching and hoping to place your security in?
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.620]   Where is it?
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.380]   It would serve you well to identify it tonight.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.060]   And in identifying it, register with the reality
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:02.020]   that it's insufficient to save you.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:09.620]   I'm pleading with you to get that one.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.540]   I want so badly for you to take it home
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   and to realize that nothing apart from Christ
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.940]   is sufficient to save.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.140]   Nothing apart from Christ is sufficient to secure.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.020]   Only He and He alone is capable of providing you a hope
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:34.640]   that will never waver, will never fade, nor ever dim.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.260]   Why do I know that?
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:44.020]   Because in Christ's life, Jesus came to give faith.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.940]   He lived in a way and He interacted with the world
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.460]   that communicated to us.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.500]   There's not just a mentality to have,
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.320]   there's a reality to experience.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:45:02.300]   I know this because Jesus, in His death,
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.740]   He came to show us love,
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.940]   not just doing by what was instinctual
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.980]   because instinct would never have led Him to the cross,
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.060]   but by doing what's intentional and saying,
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.580]   "Though you do not deserve me, I will initiate towards you.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.740]   Though you are not lovely, I will love you.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:28.180]   Though you are so very broken, I will be broken
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:32.060]   that you may be made beautiful as I am."
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:37.760]   And in Christ's resurrection, He shows us hope,
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:43.940]   that there is hope of everlasting life out in front of us,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.980]   but there's hope of everlasting life available to you
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.420]   right here, right now, tonight.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.300]   This is where the Apostle Paul begins
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.940]   as he writes this letter to the Church of Colossae.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.540]   And this is a suitable place for us to begin tonight
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   because He commends them for their faith.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.140]   He commends them for their love.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.000]   He commends them for their hope.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.900]   What's the status of your faith,
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.580]   your love and your hope here tonight?
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.900]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.900]   Father,
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:34.080]   nothing about these evenings is coincidental.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.780]   Nothing about these evenings is haphazard.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.100]   And so, Father, as I have friends here in the room tonight
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.980]   that feel like, "Man, my mail was just read."
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.940]   He just peered right into the inmost parts of my soul.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.060]   It feels like He was talking about me.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:56.980]   They would know that was by design, God,
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.540]   not mine, but yours.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.940]   For you, God, have brought them here tonight
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.140]   that something might change right now, here in this moment.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:12.900]   That, God, the conviction they feel, it's from your spirit.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.340]   It's not guilt of what happened last night,
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.740]   shame for what happened last week.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.360]   It's conviction to say,
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.420]   "You don't have to go that way any longer.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.140]   "Come with me instead."
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:28.220]   And so, God, I pray,
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.780]   as we come to the close of this evening,
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.280]   we wouldn't check out,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.460]   but we would register, God, with this truth.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.780]   You've been building to this moment,
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.140]   and you want God to meet with us as we are.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:52.460]   Stir up our hearts, sharpen our minds,
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.340]   make quick our faith, God, to follow wherever it is
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.060]   you want us to go this evening.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.020]   If it's placing hope in you, Jesus,
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.180]   would we do so fearlessly?
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.120]   Would we acknowledge, "Yes, I cannot save myself,"
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.900]   that my destiny apart from you is life here now
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.980]   and then death in the grave forever,
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.920]   and yet I can take hope knowing
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.900]   that you, Jesus, did live life here in the now.
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.060]   You did die into the grave,
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.100]   but that grave could not keep you.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.940]   You burst forth from its clutches,
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.460]   and you declared victory over all of creation,
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.420]   over all of sin, and over all of death.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.060]   Would I place my hope in you, God?
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.700]   For some of us, we need to realize,
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.300]   man, I've just intellectually ascended.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.620]   That's all my spiritual experience has been.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.100]   It's been learning more about God,
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.020]   but I want more of him tonight.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.980]   I don't want just an intellectual acquaintance.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.340]   I want an intimate acquaintance with him tonight, God.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.580]   I pray that people would confess
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.540]   and respond accordingly to that conviction.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.360]   And lastly, God, there are some people here
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.620]   that need to love those whom they have felt
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.100]   no ounce of love towards, God.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.980]   Would they see in you, Christ, one
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.660]   that did not respond to us appropriately?
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.700]   But moved towards us radically with a love.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.140]   We did not deserve God.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.220]   Move here now.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.580]   Take your time, God.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.020]   We're waiting for you.
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.900]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.500]   Hey, if you would, let's stand to our feet together.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.660]   I meant what I said when I prayed.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.060]   Like, we build to this moment,
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.540]   and it's not because we're trying
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.580]   to get an emotional draw from the room.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.420]   It's because this is the time
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.900]   when God has been working through worship and his word
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.780]   to stir up a response.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.300]   And I just wanna put it on the table before you.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:51.420]   God is real and active and true.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.260]   He wants to meet with you now.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:59.980]   How will you respond to the real and active, true God
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.340]   that is here in all of us?
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.180]   Let's sing.
