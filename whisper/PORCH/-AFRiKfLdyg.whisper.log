[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.020]   - All right, well, hey, welcome everyone
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.400]   tuning in from around the country.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.280]   Man, we are so hopeful and expectant
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.660]   and looking forward to the day
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.920]   that we can all be together,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.440]   but we're thankful for technology
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.480]   that allows us to be together now.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.260]   We know that everyone is walking through
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.520]   lots of challenges right now.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.340]   You're not alone.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.180]   God sees you.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.200]   He hasn't left you, hasn't forsaken you,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.240]   or forsaken you.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.080]   He cares about you.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.160]   We care about you.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.560]   And we're excited to continue this series tonight
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.200]   on the seventh deadly sin.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.840]   I've got a few friends in the room.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.680]   What's up guys?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   Who are a part of our team that are here.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   And so we're gonna have some fun
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.180]   for the next 30 minutes or so,
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.000]   but let me bring everybody into my world a little bit.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I was asked this weekend if I own a gun
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.920]   and I said yes.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800]   And so I'll show you that.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040]   This is not a political statement or an attempt,
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   but there is a gun that is not loaded.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000]   Doesn't even have a magazine in it.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.520]   That if I can get it out.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.520]   This is a Beretta 40 caliber gun.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   Like I said, there's no magazine.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.600]   There's nothing in it.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   And it's a gun that stays in a safe
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.180]   in a very removed up in my shelf
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.820]   in our master bedroom place
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.920]   so that none of my children can get access to it.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.380]   Because while this thing has great benefits
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.120]   and it can provide or do great things
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.580]   in the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it,
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.520]   it can be incredibly destructive.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.760]   Particularly as it relates to children.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.540]   That the idea of my children stumbling on
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.000]   or finding that thing would be incredibly destructive
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.020]   'cause they don't know how to handle a gun.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.860]   They don't know what it's for.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.020]   They wouldn't be able to use it.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.700]   And if they did use it,
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.500]   it would likely be very, very destructive.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.580]   Now, what does that have to do with anything
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.100]   we're talking about tonight?
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.180]   Well, just like that's something that I know
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.200]   because if it falls into the hands of a person
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.180]   who doesn't know how to use it
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.140]   or doesn't know what it's for
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.160]   or doesn't approach it with the same awareness
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.340]   of how destructive it could be,
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.700]   I protect it or I keep it away.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.460]   I keep it in a place where someone cannot easily access it.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.300]   There's something else.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.380]   There's a deadly sin that in all of our lives
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.060]   is something that for most of us,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.380]   we were exposed to well before we ever knew
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.260]   exactly how to handle it, what it was for,
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.220]   what to do with it.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.900]   And that's the sin of sexuality.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.420]   Or that's sexual sin.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.440]   Sex in general is not a sin.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.660]   But for most of us, at an early age,
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.580]   we bumped into an older sibling or a friend at school
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.180]   or somebody who began to tell us what sex is about,
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.300]   what sex is like.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.720]   Maybe somebody showed you pornography.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.580]   Maybe you didn't stumble into your dad's closet
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.780]   to find a gun, but you stumbled somewhere into your house
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.500]   and you found a Playboy magazine
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.020]   or you stumbled in and you found somebody's search history
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.300]   and you saw explicit content that was there
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.740]   well before you ever knew what it was for.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.340]   And it began to shape and it shaped all of us
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.660]   as it relates to how we think about sex.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.220]   So we're gonna spend the next 25 to 30 minutes
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.100]   talking about this issue
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.820]   'cause just like stumbling onto a gun
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.040]   and not knowing how to use it or what it's for,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.420]   handling it with the caution it deserves,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.780]   many of us throughout our life stumbled into sexuality
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.180]   and we weren't taught what it's for
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.460]   and how to handle it appropriately.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.700]   So we're gonna look at God's word.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.180]   What do I mean by most of us stumbled in?
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.300]   Like maybe all of us had different experiences
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.580]   that shaped the way that we think about sex.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.620]   Maybe you bumped into a friend at school
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.820]   and they showed you pornography for the very first time.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.820]   They showed you a video that to this day
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.620]   you can still see some of the images.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.500]   Maybe it was a person in your family
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.740]   and they didn't just show you a picture,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.800]   there was abuse that took place and it's impacted you.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.060]   Maybe it was a friend on the bus on the way to school,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.940]   you don't know anything about what oral sex is
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.100]   and they told you all about this is what oral sex is like.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.300]   I don't know what your initial exposure
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.660]   and experiences are as it relates to the topic of lust
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   or sexuality, but I do know that chances are you do
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.060]   and you remember it.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.460]   I remember the first time that I saw pornography
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.540]   I was 12 years old.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.460]   It was on a mission trip with our church, think about that.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.380]   We were in a hotel and somebody put on one of the channels
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.940]   that had pornographic movies taking place
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.380]   and I can still to this day,
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.100]   I can see the images that I saw that day.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.420]   Took me 20 seconds to see it
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.580]   and 20 years later I still can't forget it.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.820]   Whatever your initial and early introduction
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   to sexuality is, it shaped you, it marked you.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.900]   And God in his word over and over lays out
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.040]   the destructiveness of sex and understanding
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.060]   there's an appropriate context it's to take place in.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.300]   It's not a bad thing in general,
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.240]   no more than a gun is a bad thing in general,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.340]   but a hand's the wrong person or the hands of someone
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.760]   who doesn't understand how to use it,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.020]   it can be incredibly deadly and destructive.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.780]   As a society, we are so sexualized, it's crazy
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.780]   in terms of just the number of people who will get married
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.420]   and have slept with eight or more people already
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.720]   by the time they get married, it's just around 50%.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.960]   The number of people who will get married
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.740]   and have never slept with anyone is between three and 5%,
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.140]   a very, very, very small minority.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.220]   The number of people who have a sexually transmitted disease
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.580]   among young adults, those who are listening is one in three.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.540]   If we were sitting in a packed room,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.020]   that would mean every single person or someone
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.460]   to their right or to their left has a STD.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.980]   It's no wonder that the Me Too movement exploded
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.700]   when you come to grips with things like,
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.100]   we're losing the lights for some reason,
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.520]   the reality that every 98 seconds,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.120]   somebody is sexually assaulted.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   This was all part of an illustration here.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.680]   Just like the dark keeps, that's not at all true.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.640]   We're having a technical problem.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.280]   But it's no wonder, I mean, think about that.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.240]   Every 98 seconds in America, according to RAIN,
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.680]   someone is sexually assaulted.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.200]   You add on top of that the porn industry,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.680]   30% of the internet is pornographic,
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   a third of everything that is online.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.560]   The porn industry globally is a $97 billion industry,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.680]   making more than the MLB, Major League Baseball,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   NBA, NFL combined.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.600]   Child porn is a $3 billion industry.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.400]   Eight out of 10 men between the ages of 18 and 30
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.200]   view pornography monthly.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   One in five women view pornography monthly.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.880]   This is not, in other words, just a number.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.480]   This is a problem that has affected and impacted all of us.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   In our understanding and the way that we think about sex
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.360]   has been shaped for most of us
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.080]   by things other than God's word.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.320]   And as much as we allow the world to speak
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.720]   into how we think about sex and how we should operate
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.560]   on sex, the consequences will always be deadly
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.800]   and destructive because the world doesn't know
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.840]   how to think about sex.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.920]   God created sex.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.800]   He's the one who designed it,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.600]   and he gave it for a particular purpose.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   So tonight we're gonna look at that.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.040]   We're gonna specifically talk about love,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.480]   and we're gonna look at the relationship
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.360]   with that, we're gonna specifically talk about lust.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.040]   By lust, I mean sexual desire or actions
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.520]   that are outside of God's design.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.800]   So all sexual sense, that includes sexting,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.320]   that includes pornography, it includes having sex,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.120]   oral sex, anal sex, any type of sex outside of marriage.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   Homosexual sex, heterosexual sex,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.000]   all of that would be included.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.880]   It includes the idea of lusting after someone in the gym
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.440]   when they walk by and they're wearing Lululemon pants.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.760]   Who's going to spin class and sitting in the back
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.640]   so you can get a better view of the people in the room.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.600]   All of which would fall into the category of sexual sin.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.640]   I think for most of us, we think,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   that's not that big of a deal.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.960]   God in his word says it is a huge deal,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.120]   not just 'cause he's against sex, he's very pro-sex,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.960]   but because the ways it has destructive consequences
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.560]   and will have and is having in our lives.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.520]   So we're gonna look at the cause of sexual sin
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.280]   or the cause of lust, the cost of lust,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.560]   and then the cure that we can find for lust.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.880]   Thankfully, we're not the first society
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.520]   that was hyper-sexualized.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.760]   This may shock you, people think the Bible is outdated,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.960]   they're like, oh, the sexual stuff that we have today,
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.640]   like the Bible's just so old fashioned and crazy.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.480]   There was a city, when the Bible was written,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.280]   that looks or makes what we do today
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.920]   or makes the sexual kind of nature of our society
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.440]   look so tame compared to the way
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.560]   that they operated back then.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.600]   And that city was the city of Corinth.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.240]   Corinth was a port city that had just over 100,000 people.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.480]   It was a city that was similar to if you put New York
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   and Las Vegas together.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.920]   It was a port city, so lots of people came and went.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.320]   They had a lot of money.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   It was one of those cities that, hey,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.200]   what happens in Corinth stays in Corinth.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.120]   Why would that be the case?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.520]   Because they had a temple there
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   called the Temple to Aphrodite.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.800]   Aphrodite's the goddess in Greek literature,
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.560]   Greeks at the time believed,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.800]   who was a goddess of love and sex.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.160]   She had 1,000 temple prostitutes
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.520]   who would have sex all day long, 24/7,
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.600]   or the temple was open 24/7,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.040]   and they would collect dues from anyone
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.120]   who wanted to have sex.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.320]   So people would frequent the town of Corinth
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.880]   to go sleep and essentially live out
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.200]   any of the fantasies that they could ever imagine.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.320]   This was a city that, because of the sexual nature of it,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.360]   one scholar said it was the sexual capital
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.000]   of the ancient world.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.640]   And because of the sexual nature of it,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   the term Corinthian became synonymous
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.280]   or associated with a girl who was like a call girl
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.120]   or a prostitute.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.960]   Think about that.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.840]   Like, hey, you don't wanna mess around with her.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.680]   She's a Corinthian.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.720]   That time they're singing songs like,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.480]   man, I'm in love with a Corinthian
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   because they associated just the sexuality of that town
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.720]   with anyone who lived there.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.960]   Now, the apostle Paul loved this town.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.960]   He spent more time in this town than any other town
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.800]   or as much other than one other town in Corinth.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.680]   And while he was there, different pagans or people
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.360]   who didn't know God had spent time with the prostitutes.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.400]   They trusted in Christ,
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.200]   and now they're trying to live out their faith.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.160]   And Paul writes multiple letters to them saying,
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.460]   this is how, what it looks like
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.200]   to live out your faith in Christ.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.040]   And it was an incredibly sexualized city.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   He writes how they're to think and handle sexuality.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.000]   Tonight, we're gonna look at a passage
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.540]   in 1 Corinthians 6, starting in verse 13,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.400]   where he addresses and writes to a group of people
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.800]   who was so messed up sexually,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.640]   here's what they were doing.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.880]   I'll give you some of the punchline
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.040]   that we're about to read and go through.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.360]   They weren't having sex with their wives.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.320]   They would just go and have sex with the prostitutes.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.940]   And they didn't even think that this is that big of a deal.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.080]   They didn't totally understand it.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.120]   And Paul writes and says,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.800]   no, no, no, you don't understand what sex is.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.880]   They thought like a lot of us think,
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.000]   hey, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.900]   If I look at pornography, it's not hurting anybody.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.120]   That's how they thought about prostitution.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.720]   And Paul writes, no, no, no,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.680]   you don't understand what sex is.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.560]   So we're gonna dive in and look, starting in verse 13,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.120]   and what he says to this group.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.960]   We're jumping in the middle of the letter and conversation.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.720]   So I'll explain what he's saying.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.640]   You say, Paul writing,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.700]   food was made for the stomach and stomach for food.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.360]   So Paul's quoting one of their sayings of the town.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.640]   This is true, though God someday
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.560]   will do away with both of them.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.600]   But you cannot say our bodies were made
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.680]   for sexual immorality or sexual sin.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.000]   It's just the word porneia, where we get pornography from.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.600]   It's the whole bucket of anything sexual sin,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.880]   which is sex in any way outside of marriage.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.240]   You can't say that your bodies were made for that.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   They were made for the Lord,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.920]   and the Lord cares about our bodies.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.020]   God will raise us from the dead by his power,
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.160]   just as he raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.980]   So Paul says, hey, you don't understand sex.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.100]   You think it's just physical.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.520]   And he uses one of their own sayings
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.040]   that clearly they had associated
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.160]   in the same way they thought about sex.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.640]   In other words, they at that time thought,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   hey, the stomach is made for food, food for the stomach.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.720]   When I'm hungry, I have a stomach organ,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.200]   and so I go and I have that appetite,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.500]   and I feed that appetite,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.160]   which was also the way they thought about sex.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.900]   Just like I have a stomach organ, I have a sexual organ.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.740]   So not when I'm hungry, when I'm horny,
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.040]   I go and I have sex.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.240]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's all just some physical thing.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.040]   And Paul says, that's because you don't understand
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.520]   what sex is.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.140]   But inside of this passage, he lays out and describes
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.440]   what was true then and is true now.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.480]   The cause of sex is an appetite.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.060]   They were wrongly handling that appetite.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.900]   They thought it was like food.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.800]   If I'm hungry, I go to this.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.280]   If I'm horny, I go have sex with the prostitute.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.800]   Paul says, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what it is.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.420]   But the cause of lust or sexual sin, the first point,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.320]   is that there's an appetite or a desire
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.760]   inside of every person.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.000]   And every time we act in a way
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.060]   that's outside of God's design with that sexual desire,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.080]   lust occurs, outside of God's design for sex and lust
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   to take place in the context of marriage.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.080]   Here's one of the things that like,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.960]   a lot of Christians or a lot of people just think
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.080]   the Bible is anti-sex.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.280]   God invented sex.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.440]   He's all about it.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.040]   On the very first page, the very first command
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.920]   that God gives as it relates to sexuality,
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   as it relates to humanity, not even sexuality,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.020]   is hey, Adam, Eve, I created you.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.960]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.600]   Rule number one, be fruitful and multiply.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.320]   Make babies.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.680]   On page number two, from the very beginning,
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.140]   God is pro-sex.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.000]   We're told that he formed Adam and he formed Eve
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.400]   and he has them there together
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.120]   and they're standing in front and Adam wakes up
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.500]   and he sees his new wife there and he's like, oh man.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.040]   We're told he bursts out into song
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.920]   and he begins to talk about this naked woman's body
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.760]   in front of him.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.480]   It's before John Mayer was ever around.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.540]   He goes into, your body is a wonderland.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.800]   That's essentially what he does.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.640]   And he begins to describe this person like God
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.000]   and God looks and he says, it was good.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.680]   It's not anti-sex.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   It's incredibly pro-sex.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   Proverbs chapter five, verse 18 and 19, says this.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.120]   Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.880]   Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.040]   She's a loving dear, a graceful doe.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.400]   Let her breasts satisfy you always.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.240]   May you always be captivated by her love.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.320]   That is a command in the Bible,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.720]   for you to always be captivated by your wife's breast.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.520]   Think about that.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.480]   People think God is a prude.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.300]   He's not a prude.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.840]   He wants to protect you from the danger
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.700]   of allowing that desire or that appetite
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.380]   to be used outside of his design,
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.720]   to be used like someone who doesn't understand
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.780]   how to use a gun because it can be incredibly dangerous
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.820]   or destructive to you and I.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.640]   Now that desire gets twisted
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.680]   and we begin to want to take sex and lust
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.920]   after people who are not our wives
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.440]   or outside of the context of marriage.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.080]   And that always brings forth something
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.000]   that James chapter one tells us.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.320]   Every person is tempted when he's carried away
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.620]   and enticed by his own lust.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.720]   That lust takes him someplace.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.320]   When lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.720]   And when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.760]   What does lust look like for us?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.640]   So he says, hey, lust takes you on a path somewhere.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.400]   Lust in our context, it can look like sexual thoughts,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.040]   fantasizing about somebody at work,
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.640]   checking somebody out as they walk by
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.480]   and they're in some sort of leggings.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.320]   It can look like going explicitly
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.080]   and looking at pornography,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.540]   but you don't even have to go to porn sites.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.200]   You can find it on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok,
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.480]   movies, Netflix, sexting,
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.080]   sexual sin or lust.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.520]   And that category is any type of sex outside of marriage
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.000]   like I already said.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.080]   Masturbation.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.300]   And that desire is an appetite.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.000]   Just like the food that they were eating was an appetite.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.720]   And you know what happens when you feed an appetite?
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.880]   It grows.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.760]   We're gonna talk about that more here in a second.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.520]   But Paul's saying, hey, the cause of lust inside of you
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.480]   comes from an appetite or desire that gets distorted.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   A desire that's not used in line
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.720]   with how it was designed to be used.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.000]   And really just like Corinth,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.440]   like here's the truth about all of us, man.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.520]   We are all in this together.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.120]   We live in a culture that is constantly,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.520]   since the day that we were born,
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.080]   been feeding us and fueling
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.100]   the distorted desire of sexuality.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.080]   Feeding every time that I've seen pornographic images
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.280]   or every time that I watch a movie
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.680]   and like 15 minutes in,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.480]   the couple's shacking up and sleeping together.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.280]   It feeds something as you relate to
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.640]   or as you begin to think about sex.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.800]   The culture around us continually feeds us.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.680]   It feeds us this through the music that we listen to.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.800]   I mean, think about so many of the songs that come out.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.680]   That's what I like by Bruno Mars, "Yummy."
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.520]   That's coming out.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.720]   You have that yummy.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.600]   And they got a good beat,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.220]   but they're feeding something inside
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.440]   as it relates to sexualizing.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.640]   Savage.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.580]   Netflix has a new show called "Too Hot to Handle"
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.040]   about couples or about people.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.360]   And like whoever can not have sex first
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.760]   gets a million dollars.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.840]   Think about that.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.460]   Game of Thrones.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.900]   Everywhere that you look, it's just being bombarded.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   What's crazy is how desensitized I've become,
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.900]   we've all become,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.460]   to what 100 years ago would have shocked someone.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.300]   Like you think about when people go,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.340]   and I'm not trying to hate on anybody at the swimming pool.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.260]   When you go to the swimming pool and you see bikinis,
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.420]   people 100 years ago, like your great-grandparents,
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.260]   would have been like,
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.060]   "Why is that girl walking around
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.540]   "in her underwear right now?"
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.940]   And to us, it's totally normal.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.340]   And my point is not right or wrong or whatever.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.380]   My point is we've become desensitized.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.100]   Not only that, we have robbed from people the ability
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.620]   to even have the privilege of,
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.480]   "Hey, the first time I ever saw a woman in her underwear
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.980]   "was my wife or a guy in his underwear was my husband."
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.460]   Because you can't turn on the TV
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.660]   without seeing a Victoria Secret commercial
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   that comes through.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.300]   You can't drive down the highway without seeing some guy
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.020]   in nothing but his underwear or in a shirt,
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.340]   I mean, or just in pants.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.440]   Like we've taken that.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.060]   Culture around us has just fed it and fed it and fed it.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.340]   And things that would have shocked people before
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.220]   have just become normal.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.900]   And my point is not even to zoom in on those.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.940]   I'm just saying we've all become so desensitized to it.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.980]   It's like when I get in a hot tub,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.100]   anytime I get in a hot tub,
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.240]   I would say at my house, I don't have a hot tub,
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.020]   but anytime you get in one, it's first really hot, isn't it?
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.120]   And then what happens?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.380]   You get used to it.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.380]   And you go from like, "Oh man, this is so hot,"
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.340]   to, "This is not hot at all."
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.260]   And that's just what happens.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.380]   It's sexualizing or sex has just been thrown
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.980]   in front of all of us.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.420]   It's also impacted the way that women
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.260]   think about how to attract a guy.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.780]   Like, man, my heart breaks for ladies who are told
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.380]   from the moment that they were born,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.420]   "Hey, the way that you can catch a guy
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.540]   "or you need to find your value and how you look
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.820]   "and how many curves you have
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.060]   "or what your curves look like,"
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.900]   and they're told this is how you should catch a guy.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.960]   And you may not even realize it,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.520]   but by throwing on Instagram pictures of you
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.080]   in this bikini or the picture behind,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.660]   or here's my leg gap, you're feeding into
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.540]   what it looks like as it relates to sexuality.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.620]   And dude, my heart breaks.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.820]   I have a daughter and I know all of those same lies
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.340]   and everything that is thrown at you
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.640]   is gonna be thrown at her.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.260]   But as a bigger brother in Christ,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.740]   here's an encouragement that I would give you.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.820]   If you catch a guy with your body,
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.180]   because you got that leg gap,
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.600]   because you got those boobs, you will lose him.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.420]   When you lose that leg gap, which is gonna happen,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.820]   you will lose him when gravity takes over.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.740]   Because you're catching, like when I go fishing,
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.100]   I was talking to a friend earlier.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.900]   Do you know that there's certain fish
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.020]   that will eat anything?
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.900]   Do you guys know this?
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.780]   Like most freshwater fish, they'll eat anything.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.200]   Then there's other fish, like saltwater fish, like mackerel.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.540]   They're very selective of what they eat.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.020]   So you don't throw the right bait out there,
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.300]   they're not gonna eat it.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.700]   If you wanna catch a guy with your body,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.260]   you're gonna catch somebody,
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.540]   you're gonna catch a body snatcher.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.460]   That's what you're gonna catch.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.380]   That's the type of guy you're gonna catch.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.200]   You're not gonna touch a mackerel who's like,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.000]   no, I'm looking for a godly girl.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.680]   And if you're the person who's throwing out
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.040]   and trying to use your body to catch someone,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.200]   you're not gonna catch the type of godly man
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.400]   I think that you want.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.040]   Because godly men will see,
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.400]   man, there's a woman who's not being modest
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.720]   with her body right there.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.440]   She's not mature in her faith.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.140]   And you're throwing bait that is not gonna catch
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.640]   the type of guy that you want.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.760]   But all over our world, sexualization has taken place.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.340]   Furthermore, if all of that wasn't enough
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.840]   being thrown at us constantly,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.140]   what causes lust is oftentimes
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.580]   just our personal experience, our story.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.100]   Some of you were sexually abused as a child.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.300]   And it wasn't your fault.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.800]   And you've struggled with same-sex attraction ever since.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.060]   You were exposed to pornography.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.420]   And that led you on a path
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.160]   where your friend just showed it to you one night
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.980]   on a sleepover and you began to look at it
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.060]   and look at it and look at it.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.780]   And you have never gone a day since,
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.260]   or a very few days without seeing it.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:40.020]   Just our experience in life fuels and can feed
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.940]   and cause this.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.140]   Paul is saying it's an appetite.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.980]   And he's about to tell them,
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.300]   do not feed that appetite outside of God's design.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.820]   And here's why, verse 15.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:57.860]   Don't you realize your bodies are actually parts of Christ?
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.660]   Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.420]   and join it to a prostitute?
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.760]   Never.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.820]   Don't you realize that if a man joins himself
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.820]   to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:18.260]   For the Scriptures say the two are united into one.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.720]   For the person who's joined the Lord
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.740]   is one spirit with him.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.200]   I wish we had time to go into all the different
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.280]   incredible things that he's saying right here.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.820]   But he says, hey, don't you realize
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.580]   that when you go down, you have sex with the prostitutes
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.220]   in the temple, you are joining, infusing your body
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.060]   together with that other person.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.300]   Do you not understand exactly what you're doing?
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.380]   Run from sexual sin.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.380]   No other sin so clearly affects the body as does this one.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.820]   For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.540]   Paul lays out and goes into the cost that lust
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.380]   or sexual sin has inside of our life.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.140]   And he says, hey, look, unlike the world,
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.500]   or you think you just slept with a prostitute,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.340]   it's not a big deal.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.180]   When I'm hungry, I eat.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.340]   When I'm horny, I have sex.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.380]   He says, no, no, no, it's a way bigger deal than that.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.860]   You don't understand what sex is like.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.140]   And he uses a word for joining or you're fused together.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.500]   That's the word of gluing.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.140]   Every time you have sex with a prostitute,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.620]   you are gluing yourself to that person.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.500]   Every time you have sex outside of marriage
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.840]   or inside of marriage, you are gluing yourself
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.100]   to that person, you are fastening.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.420]   And eventually, if you guys break up
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.900]   or if the relationship doesn't work out,
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.420]   you're gonna rip each other apart
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.980]   and leave a little bit of you with them
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.540]   and a little bit of them with you.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.700]   He says, you don't understand sex.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.940]   That's not some flippant thing.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.380]   The Bible teaches it's at a soul level
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.740]   that two people are bonded together in the act of sex.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.060]   And so he's saying, man, you guys are crazy.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.620]   You can't go down there without experiencing consequences
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.120]   and sleep with prostitutes.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.980]   How does it have a cost inside of our own day and age today?
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.280]   In dating relationships, here's how it's gonna cost you.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.380]   Sex inside of the context of a dating relationship
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.140]   is gonna keep you in a relationship you should not be in.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.860]   It's gonna keep you much longer in that relationship
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.420]   because a relationship that, you know,
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.700]   had you not had sex, you would have dated maybe two months
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.760]   and been like, oh, I think we're done, this is over.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.540]   You're gonna date two years
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.620]   and you're gonna keep having sex because,
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.100]   you know what, or the reason that is
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.820]   is because sex is bonding, it's sticky.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.000]   It bonds you together, it makes it harder to leave.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.740]   Even a relationship that everyone's saying,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.520]   hey, this is, I don't think he's really good for you
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.440]   or I don't think she's really good for you.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.900]   Because sex is in there, it bonds you to that person
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.860]   and it keeps you in that relationship longer
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.580]   and it doesn't end after two months with like,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.040]   oh, nice to know you, I'm moving on.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.260]   It ends two years later with heartbreak
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.460]   and heartache and pain and regret
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.140]   because sex is sticky.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.220]   It was created to be, which is why it's such an amazing thing
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.020]   in the context of marriage
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.260]   because it continues to bond these two people
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.540]   who have promised and pledged their life to one another.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.420]   Hey, 'til death do us part, I'm in it with you
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.020]   and it bonds, every time that you have sex,
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.480]   it bonds you to that person.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.720]   But that's also why it's really dangerous
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.160]   outside of the context of marriage
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.840]   because here's what sometimes people think.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.400]   They're like, they hear from pastors
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.440]   or maybe even pastors have told them,
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.760]   like, hey, you know what, sex outside of marriage
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.120]   is not nearly as great as inside of marriage
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.160]   and it's just not gonna be that fun, so don't do it.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.200]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.520]   The problem with sex outside of marriage
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.840]   is not that it's bad, it's that it is so good
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.320]   because sex is so good.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.640]   So you're gonna experience sex
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.920]   and be bonded with someone who is not your husband
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.280]   or who is not your wife
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.760]   and you're gonna be glued in some way to that person.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.480]   The problem isn't that it's so bad, it's gonna be good
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.160]   because sex is good.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.480]   The problem is because it is so good,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.840]   it bonds you to that person
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.360]   who almost always ends up ripping
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   'cause the relationship doesn't work out
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.080]   and you end up ripping a part of you
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.980]   and they get a part of you
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.820]   and you leave with a part of them
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.820]   and the problem over time becomes like this.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.720]   This is duct tape.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.060]   If I take this duct tape
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.900]   and I put it on my arm,
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.020]   this is gonna hurt,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.260]   it rips off hair.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.620]   And if I continue to do that
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.180]   and I take it on another person
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:13.260]   and I put it on their arm
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.580]   and I attach it and I rip it off
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.820]   and I attach it and I rip it off,
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.860]   every single time that I do,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.060]   a little piece of that person is coming with me.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.940]   You know what happens over time?
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.660]   It eventually stops being sticky anymore.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.740]   That's exactly what happens in the context of sex.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.580]   That's why so many people
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.220]   have sexually dysfunctional relationships
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.460]   'cause over and over and over,
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.380]   they bonded themselves to so many different people.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.020]   Now God can heal and do anything
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.740]   because there's no sin that's more powerful than Jesus,
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.860]   including sex.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.660]   But apart from his spirit,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.380]   it is any wonder when you look around at our world
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.140]   and no relationships just don't seem to last.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.700]   Could it be because of so much sex
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.780]   that has taken place outside of the context of marriage
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.940]   and some of that bonding
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.300]   has no longer had its stickiness or bonding
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.140]   present in there?
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.740]   It'll harm your future marriage
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.620]   because however many sexual partners you've had,
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.740]   your spouse is gonna know them,
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.220]   probably wanna know them,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.700]   find themselves insecure comparing themselves,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.260]   wondering what you're thinking about them
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.160]   compared to other sexual partners you've had in your past.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.000]   And you're harming,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.920]   and there's a cost that comes every time sex is introduced.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.040]   And when you introduce it,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.240]   you make the relationship less likely
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.200]   to go the distance or in the long run,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.120]   not more likely.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.160]   There's a cost that comes
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.320]   with lust and sexual sin to our world.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.400]   I mean, just think about like,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.880]   you take the Bible, throw it away,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.080]   and you just begin to go like objectively like,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.320]   huh, if I was God, what would I teach about sex?
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.560]   Would I just say, hey, free for all,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.880]   everyone sleep together all the time?
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.800]   Or would I say, no,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.240]   sex should take place in the context of marriage?
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.720]   Well, even if you look around and you're like,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.880]   well, what happens as a byproduct of people sleeping around?
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.520]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.200]   Do you know how many lives are lost every year
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.440]   because of sex outside of marriage?
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.920]   At least a million.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.520]   There were a million abortions last year.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.920]   That's around 3000 babies a day.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.480]   Those are not happy couples,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.160]   white picket fence that are getting an abortion.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.920]   It's people who got pregnant
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.480]   and didn't wanna have the baby.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.920]   And out of lust, a life literally was lost.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.520]   3000 babies today.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.840]   Think about the fact that STDs,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.640]   now one in three people have an STD.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.400]   After years of a decline, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.760]   are all back within a vengeance,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   the vast majority of which being contracted by millennials.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.680]   10 million millennials this year,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.120]   or young adults from the ages of 18 to 30
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.320]   are gonna contract an STD.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.520]   That's in addition to the ones that got 'em last year,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.920]   ones that get 'em next year.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.960]   One in five people are living with HIV
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.120]   and have not been diagnosed.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.680]   75% of women with chlamydia don't even know it.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.800]   35% of Americans who have herpes don't know it.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.840]   One in eight people have herpes.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:07.320]   If you were God, truly, what would you do with sex?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.400]   Knowing all the pain, knowing all the emotional pain,
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.840]   that it's caused in people's lives,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.320]   knowing all the shame and guilt that people carry
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.040]   for the rest of their life because they had an abortion,
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.160]   knowing all the different ways that it's impacted
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.680]   and destroyed relationships, destroyed marriages,
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.160]   when it's taken outside of his design in marriage,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.480]   what would you do?
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:35.040]   And can anyone claim God was good if he didn't say,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.960]   sex was designed in the context of marriage?
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.520]   It has a point and a purpose and it is powerful
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.440]   and it is a gift or it can be a curse
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.640]   if it's in the wrong hands,
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.400]   like a gun in the hands of a child.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.040]   And as bad as you think you are,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.520]   and no, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.360]   like, you know, I need to find out
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.200]   I'm sexually compatible,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   you're a child that's holding a gun.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.160]   You do not know what you are doing.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.360]   You're not responsible or mature enough to handle it
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.920]   and you should give it to an adult
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.440]   who knows what to do with it.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.880]   The cost is clear all over our world.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.840]   The cost of pornography.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.560]   What is the cost of pornography?
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.360]   Emotionally, it compromises you
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.320]   because it trains your body not to bond with a person,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.400]   but with yourself.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.740]   It trains you to want variety,
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.680]   which doesn't prepare you for monogamy.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.520]   I don't need a blonde, brunette, a redhead, multiple.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.600]   And eventually, it's an appetite
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.080]   that you just continue feeding and it grows.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.500]   John Mayer did an interview with Playboy Magazine
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.640]   and he talked about pornography
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.480]   and here's what he said.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.640]   John Mayer, despite having slept
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.560]   with some of the most beautiful women in the world,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   says, "Pornography, honestly,
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.940]   "real sex doesn't do it for me anymore.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.280]   "Pornography is what I go to."
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.360]   Here's what he said.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.440]   "Internet pornography has absolutely changed
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.140]   "my generation's expectations.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.500]   "You seem very fond of pornography," Playboy said.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.860]   "When I watch porn, if it's not hot enough,
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.300]   "I make up backstories in my mind.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.800]   "This is my problem now.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.900]   "Rather than meet someone new, like a person,
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.140]   "I'd rather go home and replay the amazing experiences
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.540]   "I've already had.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.220]   "What that explains is I'm far more comfortable
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.100]   "in my own imagination than I am
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.720]   "with actual human discovery."
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.400]   That over time, that appetite got fed and fed and fed
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.440]   and it made him less human.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.360]   It made him less prone to experiencing God's design for sex
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.000]   and now he just has to come up with fantasies
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.960]   and make them up in my own head
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.720]   'cause they're not explicit enough.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.260]   And that's tragic and sad.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.460]   And there's still hope even for John Mayer.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.480]   God can heal anything.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.720]   There is no sin that is more powerful than Jesus,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.640]   which is why Jesus said, or why Paul said earlier
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.780]   in the verse, I mean, it's in my notes,
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.940]   but if you go back, it says,
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.640]   "And Jesus will raise from the dead your bodies."
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.100]   If God has power over a dead person's body,
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.080]   how much more power does he have
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.920]   over a living person's body
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.240]   that he can heal, restore, bring freedom to?
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.800]   But there's clearly a cost that our world is experiencing.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.400]   And it's like there's sex everywhere,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.800]   but almost all of it, if we follow it and act on it,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.640]   leads to death.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.460]   It's like this.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.840]   These are two pitchers of water.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   They look very similar.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.880]   One is regular fresh water.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.160]   This one is salt water.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.840]   Can't really tell, but that's what's inside.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.360]   They look strikingly similar in so many different ways.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.440]   70% of the world is covered in water.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.320]   Do you guys know that?
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.600]   70%.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.240]   You know what percentage of the world
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   of that water is drinkable?
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.800]   1.2%.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.560]   In other words, there's a lot of salt water
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.260]   everywhere around you.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.320]   There's very little fresh water.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.780]   What's interesting about this is,
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.740]   I don't know if you realize it,
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.520]   if you drink salt water, it won't quench your thirst.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.640]   It just makes you more thirsty,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.000]   and eventually it'll kill you.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.240]   Like truly, one of the most,
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.720]   the leading cause of people dying
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.080]   when they've studied people who get shipwrecked
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.280]   or they're on a raft and they're floating through the ocean,
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.160]   the number one reason they die
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.720]   is not because they ran out of water
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.600]   or it didn't rain and they couldn't drink something.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.240]   They got so thirsty, they eventually thought,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.120]   I'm gonna drink the salt water.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.360]   And that salt came in and it dehydrated them further
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.640]   and they got thirstier and thirstier,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.320]   and the salt came in, it acted against toxins in there,
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.980]   and it killed them.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.420]   They're surrounded by water in the middle of the ocean,
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.720]   yet all of it will kill them if they drink it.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.080]   It's really a great analogy
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.600]   for what sex in our culture is like.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.120]   There's water everywhere, as Tim Keller has said,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.360]   but not a drop to drink.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.120]   There's one, and they look so similar.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.040]   You're like, man, sex in marriage, sex outside of marriage,
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.640]   it looks really similar, right?
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.860]   But one leads to pain and death and heartbreak,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.040]   and one leads to life.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.120]   And God says, I love you.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.560]   I'm not anti-sex, I'm pro-sex, I made sex.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.320]   That's like Steve Jobs being anti-iPhone, that's insane.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.280]   He's pro you, so he wants you to experience and drink
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.040]   the one that will always lead to life,
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   not the one that's gonna lead you to pain and shame
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.720]   and regret and hurt, but to life.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.980]   Finally, Paul lays out really the cure
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.880]   as it relates to sexual sin and lust.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.100]   Run from sexual sin, verse 18.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.180]   No other sin so clearly affects the body as does this one,
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.280]   for sexual immorality is a sin against your own body,
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.480]   so run from sexual sin.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.960]   Don't you realize your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.260]   who lives in you and was given to you by God?
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.000]   You do not belong to yourself,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.560]   for God has bought you with a high price,
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.440]   so you must honor God with your body.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.500]   He says, you're not your own, your body is God's,
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.340]   honor him with your body.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.520]   I'm gonna come back to that in a second,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.280]   but he says you were bought at a high price.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.740]   Don't sell yourself short.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.820]   Don't sell the worth and the value that you have short
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.720]   to someone who doesn't appreciate and know
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.100]   and understand what sex is for.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.180]   Then he goes into an additional,
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.080]   and I've never connected this
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.440]   until I was reading it this week.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.040]   Like right after he goes in, hey, don't do that,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.320]   but here's what you should do.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.180]   He says this in verse two of chapter seven.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.800]   At the end of chapter six, and remember,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.360]   when the Bible was written, there weren't chapters.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.520]   That number wasn't exactly there.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.280]   Those were added later to make it easier to flip around.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.060]   So Paul finishes, honor God with your body,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.960]   and then he goes right into this.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.600]   Because there's so much sexual immorality,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.760]   each man should have his own wife,
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.120]   and each woman should have her own husband.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.240]   The husband should fulfill the sexual needs of his wife,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.480]   and the wife should fulfill her husband's needs.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.300]   The wife gives authority over her body to her husband,
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.760]   and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   Do not deprive each other of sexual relationships.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.440]   So Paul says, as it relates to sexual sin,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.640]   sex outside of marriage, run from it, flee from it.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.560]   Other times, Paul is like, hey, resist the devil.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.920]   Stand firm, be on guard.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   When it comes to sex, he says, run, run!
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.760]   So he says, run from it, and then he says,
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.560]   understand how valuable you are,
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   and then pursue Christ, and pursue marriage.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.840]   The cure for sexual sin, or cure for lust,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.160]   involves that we would flee.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.000]   How do I flee?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.200]   How do I honor God with my body?
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.980]   If you genuinely wanna be free from pornography,
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.720]   I need you to listen the next five minutes.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.220]   If you genuinely wanna experience freedom
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.680]   from a sexual relationship that you know is toxic,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.160]   and you don't wanna be in that relationship,
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.440]   or you don't wanna keep slipping up,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.280]   you want it to work,
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.080]   but you keep finding yourself crossing boundaries,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.480]   and his hand going up your shirt,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.000]   or your hand going down his pants,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.760]   going farther than you want it to go,
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.640]   here's what you have to do.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.520]   I'm gonna be really clear.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.340]   I'm gonna spell it out.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.800]   There's three words, or three letters, CPR.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.480]   If you wanna bring life into places
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.600]   where, because of sexual sin, there's death that is there,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.160]   it involves you taking action
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.600]   and doing the following three things, CPR,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   and it will breathe life into you.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.840]   The first thing, confess.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.660]   James chapter five, verse 16 says,
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.240]   "Therefore, confess your sins to each other
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.160]   "and pray for each other so that you may be healed."
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.680]   Confess at a thought level.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.960]   Hey, I had lustful thoughts today.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.760]   There was a coworker that walked by.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.600]   She bent over, and I took a second look,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.360]   and I wanted to take a third.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.400]   Will you pray for me?
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.640]   'Cause I don't wanna keep going down that path.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.280]   I clicked on an image on Instagram.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.720]   There's somebody who followed me,
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.360]   and honestly, I was like, who is this?
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.720]   And she just had a lot of cleavage,
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.840]   and I wanted to see it.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.960]   I need to confess that and get that out there.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.440]   I clicked on pornography, and I need you to know that.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.400]   I need you to pray for me,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.280]   and I wanna take steps to get rid of that.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.520]   Me and my boyfriend went farther.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.320]   Me and my girlfriend went farther than we wanted to go.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.800]   If you want to experience freedom,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.720]   you've got to bring it into the light to other believers.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.600]   If you wanna experience healing,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.240]   it involves you bringing that into light to other believers.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.200]   The second thing is pursue.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.520]   So C, confess, P, pursue.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.600]   What do you pursue?
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.160]   Pursue Christ?
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.200]   Pursue healing?
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.720]   Like some of you need to take six months,
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.600]   and you don't need to date anybody, at least.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.880]   Maybe a year.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.200]   And you need to get healthy.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.480]   You need to prioritize your relationship with Jesus,
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.520]   first and foremost.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.440]   What else do you pursue?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.780]   A marriage.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.040]   Others of you, you're in a place
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.720]   where you've been walking with Christ,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.960]   and you're doing well, and you need to just get married.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.080]   There are so many godly guys
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.480]   and so many godly girls out there,
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.560]   and you probably need to just go,
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.680]   man, I'm gonna make the decision.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.200]   I'm gonna move in the direction of marriage.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.960]   It's one of the things that Paul says is a protection
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.920]   and gift to God, gift from God in our lives
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   against sexual immorality.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.800]   Is marriage for everybody?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.880]   No.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.480]   Should everyone that's listening right now get married?
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.320]   No.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.640]   A lot of you guys are not healthy, but some of you are.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   So you pursue.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.300]   And then finally, R, remove access.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.440]   This is the run.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.400]   Jesus said something very similar as it relates to,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   hey, fleeing sexual sin, getting rid of it,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.000]   going to extreme measures, remove access to that relationship
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.080]   to however you're accessing porn.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.440]   Maybe you need to get off social media.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.460]   You need to stop watching Netflix.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.320]   Jesus said in Matthew chapter five,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.100]   "You've heard it said, you shall not commit adultery.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.180]   "But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.160]   "has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.840]   "If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.340]   "It is better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.520]   "than the whole body to be thrown in hell.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.800]   "And if your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.520]   "cut it off and throw it away."
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.400]   If you wanna heal and experience freedom from pornography,
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.240]   this will be the test.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.180]   This is the thing that will do it.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.820]   And I know a lot of people listening, they don't,
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.260]   but there's a lot of men who are saying,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.220]   I'm sick and tired of this.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.720]   I don't wanna do this anymore.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.680]   You probably need to get rid of your smartphone.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.120]   And if you don't, you need to get covenant eyes
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.960]   and block everything.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.200]   You need to have somebody in your life
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.120]   that takes away the ability to download apps,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.800]   takes away the ability to access social media,
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.160]   you take away Safari, you get covenant eyes,
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.840]   which is a software that filters
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.320]   and an accountability system.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.520]   Just go to covenanteyes.org.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.960]   I cannot encourage it enough.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.940]   I've spent hundreds of dollars over the past 12 years
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.240]   involved in covenant eyes,
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.880]   and some of the best 9.99 a month that I could spend.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.360]   Others of you, you need to get rid of Netflix.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.680]   'Cause you're going on and you're watching things
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.840]   and it brings nudity and it just triggers something
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.000]   in your mind, triggers you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.360]   And you go back like a dog to his vomit.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.120]   But you've got to remove access.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.960]   If you were coming, if we were in person
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.640]   and you told me, hey, I just don't wanna look at porn,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.760]   I feel like it's been a big struggle.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.040]   And I asked you the question, how are you accessing it?
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.960]   And you said your phone, and then you pulled out your phone
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   and it's a smartphone.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.640]   You are not taking extreme enough measures.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.720]   How badly do you want to get well?
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.460]   Because if you do, it's possible.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.960]   In summary, the cause of lust is disordered desire.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.680]   The cost of lust is life and love.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.280]   And the cure for lust is allowing the Holy Spirit
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.400]   to bring CPR into your life,
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.000]   that you would confess, pursue, and remove access.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.840]   You know what's funny about a safe
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.560]   is people keep guns in safes.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.100]   It's really not the only thing they keep in there.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.600]   What else do we keep in there?
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   Things that are valuable, money, maybe an heirloom,
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.240]   maybe a watch, maybe something that was handed down.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.320]   We keep things that are valuable
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.920]   'cause we know that not just powerful things
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.480]   need to be protected,
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.780]   things that are valuable need to be protected.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.920]   Far more valuable than anything you could put in a safe
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.300]   is your life.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.160]   And a crucial part of your life is your sexuality.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   If you don't get this thing right,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.840]   there will be all types of aspects of your life
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.560]   where if you're not sexually healthy,
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.320]   you're not gonna experience what God has for you.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.720]   And you can always get another watch,
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.560]   you can always get more money,
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.060]   you can always get any of the valuable things
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.760]   you would put in here that you try to protect.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.720]   Equally as important is that you would protect
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.360]   your sexual life, your sexuality,
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.580]   that you would preserve and protect it
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.200]   for the context of marriage.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.600]   And I know a lot of you, you're listening,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.680]   and you're like, "Wait, well, you know,
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.160]   "I've already messed up so many different times."
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.600]   And I know this is a huge lie.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.560]   I've talked to so many people,
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.920]   and they're like, "Hey, once you have sex,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.080]   "you know, it's kinda like it's done for me, I'm over it."
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.200]   It's not done, it's not over.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.580]   Whatever's in the rear view mirror,
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.120]   God is not done with you yet.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.800]   And he offers forgiveness and restoration,
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.000]   and whatever is behind you, you don't even need it.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.600]   Worry about it anymore, but today, you have the decision,
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.760]   am I gonna protect myself?
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.700]   Am I gonna pursue healing, protect my sexuality?
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.840]   I'm not sleeping with anybody else
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.400]   for as long as I get married.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.240]   I'm not looking at pornography ever again.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.080]   I'm making the decision.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.840]   I am not gonna be influenced by what the world says.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.320]   I'm going to follow what God invites me to,
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.300]   and experience in the context of marriage,
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:49.280]   what he designed, which is intimacy,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.600]   and sex, and lust to take place.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.960]   You are so valuable.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.840]   In this passage, I'm landing here,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.740]   Paul says, "You were bought with a price."
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.160]   You begin to wonder, like, what is he talking about?
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   Why does he use that imagery, and what price?
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.860]   You know, right outside of Corinth,
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:13.240]   there was a slave trade, or a prostitution place,
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.620]   where you could go, and they could buy,
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.120]   and purchase prostitutes.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.360]   He uses the imagery that his audience would have known,
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.760]   and been familiar with, of, oh yeah,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.600]   you were bought with a price,
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.420]   just like you can go over there,
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.820]   and you could buy one of the prostitutes.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.160]   People could go, they could purchase a prostitute,
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.600]   which had to have been seen as damaged goods,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.440]   and you know what they could do?
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.240]   They could set 'em free, they could make them their wife.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.960]   They could do anything.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.280]   And Paul invokes this imagery, and he says,
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.040]   this is what God has done with you.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.800]   You were someone who didn't deserve to be purchased.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.560]   You were like the damaged goods of prostitutes,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.240]   you and myself, and every person who ever lived,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   and despite all of that, God gave his life,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.520]   'cause that's how valuable you are to him.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.800]   And he was willing to purchase people who didn't deserve it,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.120]   and he didn't just purchase it with some cash from a safe,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.720]   with his own life.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.400]   You are so valuable.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.320]   You can get another, anything you would put in here,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.760]   you do not get another you.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.160]   Are you gonna choose to protect your sexual life,
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.880]   or not?
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.560]   One of the lies you're gonna have to get over
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.440]   is the fact that you're done, or God's done with you,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.160]   or because of what you've done, he would be done with you.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.620]   The reason we know that doesn't have to define you
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.280]   is how this passage started.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.120]   In other words, you know what the verses
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.480]   right before this passage are?
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.240]   Paul reads, you've probably heard these before,
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.440]   if you've been in church.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.360]   This is right before he goes into,
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.200]   now stop sleeping with prostitutes.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.480]   Those who indulge in sexual sin,
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.200]   who worship idols or commit adultery,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.120]   are male prostitutes or practice homosexuality,
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.840]   are thieves or greedy, are drunkards,
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.800]   or are abusive, or cheat people.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.040]   None of these will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.680]   If Paul stopped there,
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.440]   there'd be no hope for me.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.280]   Not for me,
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.640]   but for most of us.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.800]   Listen, if you've done any of these, you don't get in.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.280]   Look at what he says next.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.680]   Some of you were once like that,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.000]   but you were cleansed.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.040]   You were made holy.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.480]   You were made right with God
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.200]   by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.160]   and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.240]   Think about what he is saying.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.360]   He's about to talk to men
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.520]   who were sleeping with prostitutes,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.960]   and he says, hey, you were sexually immoral.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.880]   Now you're righteous.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.720]   Now you're cleansed.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.560]   Now you're holy.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.400]   That's you.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.520]   Wait a second, Paul, you're about to tell them
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.160]   to stop sleeping with prostitutes.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.280]   They're righteous, holy, cleansed?
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.600]   Yes, 'cause they called on the name of Jesus.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.440]   Their past, their sin, all of it doesn't define them.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.040]   Jesus does what he did on the cross did, and does,
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.520]   and it doesn't define you.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   Now is that Paul saying,
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.280]   hey, just keep sleeping with prostitutes?
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.200]   No, his point is sexual sin hurts you every single time.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.720]   You don't stop sleeping with prostitutes
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.200]   'cause it'll keep you out of heaven.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.800]   Not accepting Jesus keeps people out of heaven.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.440]   You stop sleeping with prostitutes,
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.680]   and you stop having sex outside the context of marriage
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.160]   'cause it only damages you.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.200]   It hurts you every time.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.840]   That's his point.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.200]   The point is that those things don't define you.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.440]   They don't have to define you.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.080]   If you have trusted in Jesus, and now he's invited you
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.320]   not to go and continue to live a life of sin,
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.480]   Paul says in Romans chapter six,
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.340]   "Shall we continue to sin so that grace may abound?"
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.520]   By no means.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.040]   The people who love God, they turn from those things
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.940]   'cause they know it's drinking poison.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.440]   But if that's a part of your past,
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.280]   if it's a part of your present,
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.360]   if you've trusted in Christ, you were washed,
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.080]   you were cleansed, you were made holy,
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.440]   and now he's invited you to the life that you want,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.040]   to the future marriage that you want,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.360]   to experience CPR and breathing back into life
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.880]   through confession, pursuing Jesus,
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.240]   and through removing access and repenting,
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.740]   and the choice is yours and the choice is mine.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.680]   What am I gonna do?
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.480]   We pray.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:21.680]   Father, I pray for every person
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.140]   that is listening to this message right now,
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.120]   and that will listen in the days ahead.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   That has been deeply wounded as it relates to sexuality,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:40.680]   as it relates to relationships where sex was a part of it,
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.000]   and it really scarred 'em.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.360]   I pray for every person who's seen images
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.520]   that we don't even wanna see,
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.620]   we just can't even get rid of in our head.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   Those who are sexually abused, hurt, wounded,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:05.000]   that you right now, by your spirit,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.600]   would bring healing, would breathe life,
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.300]   would perform CPR on your people,
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:16.360]   to help us, God, to be marked by a life
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.080]   that resembles our Savior, that doesn't pursue purity
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.200]   because it gets us into heaven,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   but pursues purity 'cause it's accessing life.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.040]   Would you form amazing marriages
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.340]   through the lives of people in this room
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.440]   and people that are listening on site,
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.360]   anchored together with other people of God,
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.080]   and would you make us all more like Jesus?
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.920]   Would you help us?
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.440]   I pray for anyone who feels shame and guilt and emotions,
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.640]   you don't want them to feel,
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.100]   you want them to be led to recognize
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.400]   they're just like all of us, we're unworthy prostitutes,
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.200]   unworthy of being loved and cared for,
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.960]   and you purchased us,
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.680]   you brought us into a relationship with you,
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.520]   you set us free, and we can walk in that.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.760]   In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.520]   (wind whooshing)
