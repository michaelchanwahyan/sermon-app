1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:29,440
 - My life before Christ was a pursuit of happiness

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
 that always left me wanting more.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,020
 Growing up and all throughout high school and college,

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,720
 culture defined what I thought and believed.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,560
 Music, TV, and movies all told me

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,120
 that happiness can be found in having the perfect beach body,

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,000
 dating the guy everyone else wanted,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,380
 having lots of money,

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,820
 and living the spring break lifestyle all year round,

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,240
 which was easy since I grew up in Florida.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,640
 So I chased those things.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,560
 And in college, I found myself drinking nearly every night,

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 working at a club in downtown Orlando,

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,160
 and finding identity in what people thought about me,

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
 especially the guys I would date.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,560
 At times, I felt happy.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,520
 I even convinced myself I was living the dream.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,920
 But as morning broke,

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
 and the high of this world faded as it always did,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,440
 I wondered why none of it was ever enough.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,280
 During college, I went to Las Vegas on a girls' trip

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,840
 and met a guy who the world would consider prince charming.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
 It made sense to me that the one thing I was missing

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
 to make my life feel complete was a husband like him.

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
 I thought to myself, this is it.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,120
 He is the missing link.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
 So two days after graduating college,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
 I packed my bags and moved to Seattle where he lived

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,300
 in hopes of fulfilling my pursuit of happiness.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,560
 After moving to Seattle,

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,520
 I soon realized that I had everything I thought

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 would make me happy,

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
 but it still didn't feel like I was enough.

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
 I still felt so empty.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,360
 Life became dull and repetitive.

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
 With nothing this world had to offer

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
 being able to satisfy me,

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,660
 I started getting anxiety and panic attacks

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,520
 that were mentally and emotionally paralyzing.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,680
 My heart racing, sweaty palms,

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,800
 feeling really lightheaded,

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,000
 and a fear of impending doom would rush over me.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,660
 I started attending church in hopes to find relief.

45
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,800
 I went to church as a kid and I knew about Jesus

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
 and how he had died for my sins.

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,260
 I even called myself a Christian,

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,880
 but I was not following Christ.

49
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,960
 I was following the world.

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,400
 One day at church, I heard a story from the Bible

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,340
 about how even demons acknowledge that Jesus is Lord.

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,080
 Demons believe in Jesus.

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,460
 For weeks, that thought raced through my mind.

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,640
 I would think about it often

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,240
 and eventually came to the conclusion

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,280
 that I was not a believer just because I said I was.

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,100
 Through many encounters with God's word and his people,

58
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,720
 I ended up surrendering my life to Christ.

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,320
 I turned from my sin and my pursuit of happiness

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,400
 and trusted in him.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,240
 During that time, a friend sent me a podcast from the porch

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,840
 and as I listened, I realized Christianity

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,880
 wasn't just a thing you do on Sundays.

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,940
 It's something that informs every decision that you make.

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,320
 Through listening to the porch messages,

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,720
 I began to learn what it looks like to follow Christ

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
 and it changed everything about my life,

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
 my playmates, my playgrounds, even where I lived.

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,880
 I applied and was accepted to the Watermark Residency Program

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,320
 and am now serving in the very ministry

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,100
 that Jesus used to capture my heart.

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,160
 Before Christ, I followed what the world said

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,040
 would make me happy and was left empty-handed.

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,760
 Knowing Christ, I gave up everything I had to follow him

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,100
 and found more joy than ever before.

76
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,280
 Now, my identity cannot be shaken

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
 because it is secure in Christ.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,000
 I no longer have to question who I am.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,300
 I am a daughter of God and an heir to his eternal kingdom.

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,080
 My past sin does not defy me

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,540
 and my future sin cannot separate me from his love.

82
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,640
 Because of Christ, I am set free

83
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,320
 from my pursuit of happiness

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,440
 and I have true joy in the Lord.

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,580
 It is finished.

86
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,980
 (congregation applauding)

87
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,320
 (congregation cheering)

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,220
 Roll up my sleeves for this one.

89
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:10,300
 You guys ever been stuck?

90
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,820
 Stuck in life, like you just,

91
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,980
 you feel like you can't go forward,

92
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,920
 like kind of spiritually apathetic,

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,660
 continuing to beat your head against the same walls,

94
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,420
 like a dog to his vomit, as the Proverbs say,

95
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,860
 you continue to return to the same sins,

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,820
 wanting freedom but can't get it.

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,260
 I love Elena's story.

98
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,220
 That when she moved over in that driver's seat

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,260
 and God came in and God consumed her life,

100
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,020
 everything changed, it's been real,

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,000
 it's been a lot of fun for me to have a front row seat

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,620
 for the second part of that story

103
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,380
 that she just shared with you guys.

104
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,380
 Growing up, my family, we would vacation

105
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,980
 in a place at the beach called Port Aransas.

106
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,760
 Anybody ever been to Port Aransas?

107
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,220
 It's kind of beach-ish, it's kind of beach.

108
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,500
 And my dad, we grew up on a farm

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,020
 and so my dad had this big extended cab,

110
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,160
 long bed Chevrolet pickup truck

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,740
 that he would use to pull a trailer.

112
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,500
 And so it had a, it was a standard, it was a stick shift.

113
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,660
 And we would, the cool thing about Port A

114
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,180
 is you could drive on the beach,

115
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,260
 you could drive in the sand,

116
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,280
 a lot of places you can't do that,

117
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,300
 but we would go there,

118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,260
 this is where we would vacation as a family

119
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,340
 and you could drive on the beach.

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,740
 And so one of my favorite things to do

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,100
 was take my dad's truck up and down that beach,

122
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,300
 but there was one problem with that,

123
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,420
 there was just something about maneuvering that standard,

124
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,900
 maneuvering that stick shift,

125
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,540
 that and I just didn't get along.

126
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,620
 And so I would always get stuck on the beach.

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,420
 This happened multiple times, not just once or twice,

128
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,940
 many, many times I would get stuck

129
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,860
 in his truck on that beach.

130
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,700
 And so I can remember very vividly

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,420
 being me in the driver's seat, my buddy with me,

132
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,220
 and just like, oh no, like you kind of,

133
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,340
 the wheels start spinning.

134
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,500
 And so I would, you know, shift into first

135
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,940
 and throw sand everywhere and then shift into reverse,

136
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,420
 throw sand everywhere and like, just wasn't going anywhere.

137
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,580
 And the more I try to get unstuck,

138
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,820
 eventually I just buried the axle.

139
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,540
 Like we weren't going anywhere.

140
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,020
 And so that, this is like in my shame now, you know,

141
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,660
 probably about an hour later,

142
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
 my buddy gets out of the truck

143
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,380
 and he goes to get my dad

144
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,300
 at whatever hotel we're staying at there along the beach.

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,220
 And then my, and I can remember this

146
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,160
 would happen every time.

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,300
 My dad would come, he'd open the driver's side door,

148
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,340
 he'd say, scoot over.

149
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,180
 Big guy, you know, and then he would just shift into reverse,

150
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,300
 give it some gas, shift into first and just pull out.

151
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,580
 And I was like, how did you do that?

152
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,600
 It was like magic.

153
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
 And he would always do it.

154
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,540
 And I just like, I don't understand.

155
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,500
 Like, how did you do that?

156
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,380
 I've just spent the last hour trying to get unstuck

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,860
 only to get more stuck.

158
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,740
 And then all of a sudden when he comes in the driver's seat,

159
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,260
 he just pulls right out.

160
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,820
 And I share that with you

161
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,280
 because some of you came in tonight feeling stuck.

162
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,100
 There's really three categories

163
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,540
 of people in the room right now.

164
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,940
 There's this category of folks who are experiencing

165
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,420
 the fullness of life that Jesus Christ comes to offer.

166
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,140
 They're not the naive ones.

167
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,020
 They are the blessed ones.

168
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,240
 They are the ones that figured something out

169
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,580
 that a lot of us haven't figured out yet.

170
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,140
 And then there's some others of us

171
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,860
 that continue to beat our head against the wall

172
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,740
 and we're kind of white knuckling this thing.

173
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,580
 And we're trying to get unstuck

174
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,700
 and we're just burying the actual.

175
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,980
 And we realize it, but we don't know what to do.

176
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,220
 And we're just continuing to try to beat,

177
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,060
 you know, try to get unstuck,

178
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,580
 but we're beating our heads against the same wall.

179
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,820
 And then there's those of you,

180
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,220
 there's another category of folks

181
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,820
 who are doing the wrong things and delighting in it.

182
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,600
 You're like, I don't really care.

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,680
 Like, give me a little bit of God on Tuesdays,

184
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,520
 maybe on Sundays, and then let me have my freedom

185
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,600
 with the rest of my life.

186
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320
 I'm going to do what I want to do.

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,960
 And so this evening, I wanna speak

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,600
 to all three of those categories

189
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 as the Apostle Paul teaches us from this book of Romans.

190
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,120
 We're in a series now, Romans 8, if you want to turn there.

191
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,460
 We're gonna be looking at verses 5 through 13

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,120
 in Romans chapter 8.

193
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,460
 And we've entitled this Romans 8, Walk by the Spirit.

194
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,540
 And last week, David just did a great job

195
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,960
 of talking about what it looks like

196
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 to live a life of independence to the Spirit of God.

197
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
 And I want to elaborate on this tonight,

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,480
 letting the Spirit of God drive your life.

199
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,940
 Who is in the driver's seat of your life?

200
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,920
 Is it you?

201
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,460
 Is it God?

202
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,560
 Is it your flesh?

203
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,160
 Do you do what you wanna do when you wanna do it?

204
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,040
 Or is it God, the creator of the heavens and the earth?

205
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,360
 Who is in the driver's seat of your life?

206
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,900
 And so we're just gonna talk about tonight

207
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,720
 how one, the flesh and the Spirit are fighting for your mind.

208
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 Two, who wins will determine where you go.

209
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,080
 And three, before you leave here this evening,

210
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,240
 I want to admonish you, exhort you to decide now

211
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,980
 who will drive your life.

212
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,820
 And I think the reason this is so important this evening

213
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,180
 is because you cannot have a full life

214
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,860
 without an understanding of this message.

215
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,580
 You cannot experience the full spiritual life

216
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,020
 that God desires for you if you do not understand

217
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,440
 what this message this evening teaches.

218
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,040
 And so I think we need to reevaluate who is driving.

219
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,900
 Let's go.

220
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
 Verse five.

221
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,140
 Those who live according to the flesh.

222
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,620
 Now that word, the flesh, that's just not a term

223
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,660
 that we use often outside of church.

224
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,980
 And so what is that?

225
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,900
 That is your sin nature.

226
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,480
 The flesh, this word right here means

227
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,040
 the part of you that loves to sin.

228
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,540
 This is the part of you that hates authority.

229
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,940
 This is the part of you that hates accountability.

230
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,960
 This is the part of you that wants to hide

231
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,180
 those things that you do on the weekend.

232
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,220
 This is the part of you that does not want to talk

233
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,820
 to your community group about those types of things.

234
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,380
 This is the part of you that loves to sin.

235
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,060
 And this part of you has, your mind has their mindset

236
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,420
 on what the flesh desires.

237
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,000
 It only cares about what it wants.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
 But those who live in accordance with the spirit

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,660
 have their mindset on what the spirit desires.

240
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,380
 Spirit there is God's spirit.

241
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,860
 It's the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost,

242
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,440
 a person of the Trinity.

243
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,060
 The mind governed by the flesh is death.

244
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,140
 But the mind governed by the spirit is life and peace.

245
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,860
 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God.

246
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,460
 The mind governed by the flesh hates God.

247
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,300
 The part of you that loves to sin does not like the one

248
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,220
 who has the rules that lead to life.

249
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,180
 The part of you that loves to sin wants to be free from God.

250
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,580
 It's hostile to God.

251
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,140
 It wants to do what it wants to do,

252
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,620
 whatever it wants to do it.

253
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,840
 It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.

254
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,060
 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.

255
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,900
 When you live according to the flesh, you cannot please God.

256
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,580
 And you say, well, maybe I can do good

257
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,100
 when I live according to the flesh.

258
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,180
 You doing good with the wrong motive is not good, it's bad.

259
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,620
 First Corinthians 13 says, if I do all of these things,

260
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,740
 but I don't do them for the right motive, it's for nothing.

261
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,340
 And so you doing good with the wrong heart,

262
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,580
 you doing good not to please God,

263
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,160
 even you doing good to please man is sin.

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
 And so my first point this evening is,

265
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,400
 there is a fight for the driver's seat of your mind.

266
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,700
 Paul is writing to us, talking about the mind

267
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,820
 and where it goes.

268
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,420
 And there's this kind of dichotomy going on.

269
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,060
 The flesh wants to drive, but the spirit wants to drive.

270
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,500
 There's a battle over your mind.

271
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,660
 You can picture this.

272
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,500
 And I want you to listen.

273
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,820
 If the enemy can win the mind of a man,

274
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,780
 he can keep him from the pleasures of God.

275
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,620
 Let me say that again.

276
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,940
 If the enemy can win the mind of a man,

277
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,180
 he can keep him from the pleasures of God.

278
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,740
 But if a person's mind belongs to the Lord,

279
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,560
 so does the entire person.

280
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,780
 If God has your mind, then he has your life.

281
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,660
 He has you.

282
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,340
 And so there's these two drivers

283
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,100
 at war with the natural human.

284
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,220
 Two drivers fighting for the will.

285
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
 One is the flesh.

286
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,300
 That's the one that desires to kill you,

287
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,140
 to take you off a cliff, to send you to a despair.

288
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,740
 Listen, I don't have to prove this to you.

289
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,980
 Think about people who do whatever they want to do,

290
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,100
 whenever they want to do it.

291
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,960
 They are some of the most dysfunctional people

292
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,120
 you'll ever meet and the least godly.

293
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
 Do you hear me?

294
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,940
 I mean, these are the types of people

295
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,660
 reality shows are made out of,

296
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,860
 because we are entertained by how comedic

297
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,900
 and sad their life is.

298
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,540
 People who do whatever they want to do

299
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,320
 are some of the most desperate, despairing people

300
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,740
 you will ever meet and the least godly

301
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,580
 and the most dysfunctional.

302
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,740
 See, the flesh, your flesh right now,

303
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,380
 the sinful nature of you, the sinful part of you,

304
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,580
 the part of you that loves to sin,

305
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,900
 desires to feed itself.

306
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 It is excited at the opportunity to do wrong.

307
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,460
 Let me explain.

308
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,460
 Do you remember, my parents would travel sometimes.

309
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,840
 You know, when I was in high school,

310
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,940
 they would go on vacation together

311
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,420
 and they'd leave me at home by myself, which was crazy,

312
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,140
 but they would leave me at home by myself

313
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,200
 and I can remember just when that door would shut

314
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,380
 with them on the other side of it

315
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
 and them driving down the road,

316
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,940
 knowing they were gonna be gone for a weekend

317
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,020
 and just like, it's on.

318
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,740
 I can now do whatever I want to do,

319
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,140
 which is really to say I can feed my flesh party.

320
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,180
 It's on and so maybe that wasn't you,

321
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,420
 but maybe it was when you went to college.

322
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,340
 You get to college, parents drop you off, right?

323
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,340
 You've got all of your belongings in a suitcase

324
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,380
 and a twin size mattress and there you are

325
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,260
 in your dorm room or some apartment

326
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,420
 with your ficus tree and nothing else

327
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,420
 and you're like, oh my goodness, freedom at last.

328
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,900
 Like I can do whatever I want to do.

329
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,020
 That is the excitement of your flesh

330
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,740
 at the opportunity to do wrong.

331
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,540
 Or maybe you've gone to Vegas like Elena

332
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,380
 and you get off that plane and you're like,

333
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,600
 what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas

334
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,500
 and in a moment at your fingertips is money,

335
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,820
 is gambling, is prostitution, is alcohol, is party

336
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,500
 and it's just that like, we're here, baby.

337
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,980
 That's your flesh.

338
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,540
 That's the part of you that desires to kill you.

339
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,500
 Maybe you don't need Vegas.

340
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,140
 Maybe you're just out in Dallas

341
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,840
 or maybe you're out in Fort Worth.

342
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,900
 You're there at Sundance Square or maybe you're in Uptown

343
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,540
 and you're thinking, okay man, Friday night it's on

344
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,740
 or maybe it's Monday and all you can think about is Friday.

345
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,140
 That's the part of your flesh that desires to kill you.

346
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,220
 It's a little bit unsettling

347
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,100
 if you think about it for too long.

348
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,540
 Or maybe you travel for work

349
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,100
 and you get off that plane in some other city

350
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,700
 and you're like, no one really even knows

351
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,740
 where I am right now.

352
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,180
 I can do whatever I wanna do and you call it freedom.

353
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
 But what Paul is saying is, no,

354
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,180
 it's not just freedom from the rules.

355
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,500
 It's freedom from integrity.

356
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,580
 And what it really is, it's freedom to forget about God.

357
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,840
 And if you keep pursuing the freedom to forget about God,

358
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,540
 you're not gonna remember God any longer

359
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,860
 until you meet him in the afterlife.

360
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,460
 This is the hostility toward God that our flesh pursues.

361
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,900
 But the spirit, God's Holy Spirit,

362
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,340
 verse six, gives life and peace.

363
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,380
 See, allowing the spirit to drive is not optional

364
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,620
 for this full spiritual life.

365
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,860
 It is absolutely mandatory.

366
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:16,260
 Without the spirit driving, your spiritual life is dying.

367
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,640
 It's like trying to go on a road trip

368
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,220
 with an empty tank of gas.

369
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,080
 Like you may be able to run on fumes for just a few miles,

370
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,820
 but pretty soon you're gonna be dead

371
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,220
 on the side of the road.

372
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,660
 This is what it's like trying to pursue God

373
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,980
 without allowing the spirit, God's Holy Spirit,

374
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,220
 to drive your life.

375
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,240
 And so God, he's not trying to keep something from you.

376
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,460
 God's not trying to rip you off.

377
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,180
 God wants to set you free.

378
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,340
 God's not trying to keep that guy from you in Seattle.

379
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,200
 He's not trying to keep that job from you.

380
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,140
 He's not trying to keep you from going out

381
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,560
 with all of those friends.

382
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,740
 He's trying to show you a path of freedom.

383
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,880
 He doesn't want you to die.

384
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,760
 He doesn't want your flesh to take you off a cliff.

385
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,100
 See, some of you, you're here tonight,

386
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,360
 you've got one foot in the church

387
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,760
 and one foot in the world,

388
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,380
 and you've got the worst of both worlds.

389
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,800
 Like you're going like this.

390
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,900
 Your life's a train wreck.

391
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,540
 You're swerving all over the road.

392
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,960
 You're like, "Oh, give me a little bit of church

393
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,240
 "and a little bit of the party."

394
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
 And it hasn't worked out for anyone

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
 in the history of history.

396
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,420
 I've tried it, believe me.

397
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,120
 I've talked to a lot of you who've tried it.

398
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,240
 I've never talked to the person like,

399
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,580
 "No, man, I got one foot in the church,

400
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,420
 "one foot in the world.

401
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,440
 "It's working like a champ, man.

402
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,720
 "It's working great, it's going great for me."

403
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,980
 No, it never works.

404
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,320
 You're swerving all over the road.

405
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,400
 You look in the rear view mirror

406
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
 and there's just a pileup of cars,

407
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,800
 and the only bad driver on the road is you.

408
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,900
 'Cause there's a fight for the steering wheel.

409
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,040
 See, letting your flesh drive is not just a bad idea,

410
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,300
 it's suicidal.

411
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,520
 It's suicidal to your spiritual life.

412
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,040
 It's suicidal to everything that God desires for you.

413
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,400
 The other night, I've got a three-year-old at home right now,

414
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
 Weston, my son, and he was sick.

415
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
 So he was just crying hysterically all night,

416
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
 really out of character for him.

417
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600
 He's a pretty happy dude, but this particular night,

418
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
 he's just screaming his head off,

419
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,720
 like that hyperventilating crying.

420
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,760
 So we eventually go up there.

421
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,080
 I don't think he's going back to sleep, babe.

422
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,200
 And so I go up there and I pull him out,

423
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,760
 and I'm like, "Buddy, it's gonna be okay."

424
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,320
 He will not calm down.

425
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,800
 And I'm like, I'm desperate 'cause I'm tired.

426
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,480
 I'm like, I don't even, I just feel completely out of it.

427
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,720
 I'm holding him, I'm like, "Buddy, you just need to stop."

428
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
 And he won't stop.

429
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
 And so, and don't judge me for this, okay?

430
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,640
 It was like parenting low moment, but I go to bribery.

431
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
 I'm like, "Hey, buddy, I will buy you a remote-control car

432
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,880
 "if you stop."

433
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,800
 And the truth is I wanted a remote-control car,

434
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,080
 and this was just like an excuse to get it,

435
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
 but I'm like, okay.

436
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,560
 And it worked, like clockwork, again, don't judge me,

437
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,400
 but it worked.

438
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,600
 I mean, he stopped.

439
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,160
 He's like, "What color?"

440
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
 (congregation laughing)

441
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,540
 I'm like, "All right."

442
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,960
 He's like, "I want a red and gray one, Daddy."

443
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,800
 I'm like, "Okay."

444
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
 And so he goes back to sleep,

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,040
 sleeps all through the night.

446
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,800
 I wake up the next day, I'm like, I tell Monica,

447
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,560
 I'm like, "Hey, I gotta buy Weston a remote-control car."

448
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,480
 She's like, "Like the one you wanted?"

449
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
 I'm like, "Exactly, the one I..."

450
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,000
 And so I go to the hobby shop.

451
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,360
 I'm like, "Okay, you know, I'm new to the game."

452
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
 He's like, "Well, what are you looking for?"

453
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,920
 I'm like, "Red and gray."

454
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,600
 And so they have one red and gray when I leave with it.

455
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,360
 And so we go home and I'm driving.

456
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,380
 I mean, he's just ecstatic, you know?

457
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,920
 And so we're driving it, and I mean,

458
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,200
 these things have evolved.

459
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
 Like, I don't know when the last time you played

460
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
 with a remote-control car is, but the game has changed, man.

461
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
 I mean, it goes 30 miles an hour

462
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,720
 and just does all this crazy stuff.

463
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,880
 I'm like, "This is awesome."

464
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,920
 And so I'm driving, and the whole time he's like,

465
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
 "Daddy, let me drive, Daddy, let me drive,

466
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,320
 "Daddy, let me drive, Daddy."

467
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,240
 I'm like, "What do you think, it's yours?"

468
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
 You know?

469
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,320
 And so anyways, and so he just keeps saying that.

470
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
 And so eventually, you know, I get weak

471
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,160
 and I hand him the remote-control car.

472
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,440
 When he takes it, it takes about three seconds

473
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,360
 for him to hammer the gas and drive it 30 miles an hour

474
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
 directly into the curb.

475
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,940
 You know, cars in pieces, okay?

476
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,440
 And so I go and I get it,

477
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,420
 and I kind of piece it back together,

478
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,760
 and I make it drivable again.

479
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,040
 And then I'm driving it, and I'm, you know,

480
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,200
 showing him everything that it can do.

481
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
 And he's like, "Let me drive, let me drive,

482
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,880
 "let me drive, let me drive, let me drive."

483
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,120
 And so I'm like, "Okay, but listen,

484
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,360
 "you can't take it straight to the curb."

485
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,100
 And he's like, "Okay, I won't, Daddy, I won't."

486
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,120
 I give it back to him.

487
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,320
 He hammers the gas, boom, straight into the curb,

488
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
 cars in pieces again.

489
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,680
 I go, I put the car back together, I'm driving it.

490
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,760
 He's just, "Let me drive, let me drive,

491
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,600
 "let me drive, let me drive."

492
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,120
 We do this about four or five times

493
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,960
 until it's broken, like, to the point

494
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
 that it can't be repaired by me anyways.

495
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
 I've gotta take it back to the hobby shop

496
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,320
 and say, "Hey, can you guys fix this?"

497
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,960
 No, he's a three-year-old, I know.

498
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,960
 And so what's funny about that

499
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,980
 is, like, he never came to the conclusion, like,

500
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,020
 "I'm not good at this."

501
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,620
 (congregation laughing)

502
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,640
 Like, even though he was really bad at it,

503
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,780
 he was like, "Let me drive, let me drive,

504
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,900
 "let me drive, let me drive."

505
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
 That's your flesh.

506
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,380
 Your flesh doesn't care if it's running into walls

507
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,620
 at 30 miles an hour.

508
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,640
 It just wants the steering wheel.

509
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,700
 It doesn't care if your life's a train wreck.

510
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,300
 It doesn't care if you're sad, if you're desperate,

511
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,860
 if you're despairing, if you're depressed.

512
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,060
 It doesn't care if you're drunk or hungover.

513
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,260
 It doesn't care how you feel.

514
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,140
 It just wants the steering wheel.

515
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,380
 And it continues to do the same thing

516
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,840
 over and over and over.

517
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,380
 And so you're like, "Maybe this time we will get married."

518
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,540
 No, you probably won't.

519
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,580
 It's probably gonna end in flames

520
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,100
 'cause you're not letting the Spirit drive.

521
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,020
 "This time I won't feel so bad."

522
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,620
 Yes, you will.

523
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,140
 Because you have the Holy Spirit

524
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,200
 and you grieve the Spirit when you sin.

525
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,220
 I've heard it said, "When you become a Christian,

526
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,220
 "you're not sinless, you just sin less and you feel worse."

527
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,140
 When you become a Christian, you're not sinless,

528
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,940
 you just sin less and you feel worse.

529
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,060
 So Paul writes, verse nine, "You, however, you,"

530
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
 there's this like new category, like, okay,

531
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,980
 there's the one who lives by the flesh

532
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,260
 and runs cars into walls at 30 miles an hour

533
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,660
 and their life's in flames, but you're different.

534
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,720
 You're different.

535
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,940
 You're not in the realm of the flesh,

536
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,140
 but you're in the realm of the Spirit, the Spirit of God.

537
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,780
 You live for eternal things.

538
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,980
 You don't live for the merely stupid,

539
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,020
 temporary, natural things,

540
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,340
 the things of this world that won't be here.

541
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,620
 You live in the realm of the Spirit,

542
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,780
 if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.

543
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,860
 And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ,

544
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,740
 then they don't belong to Christ.

545
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,300
 But if Christ is in you,

546
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,360
 then even though your body is subject to death

547
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,860
 because of sin, the Spirit gives life

548
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,140
 because of righteousness.

549
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
 Whose righteousness?

550
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,220
 Your righteousness?

551
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,020
 Now, this is the gospel right here.

552
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,120
 This is what we just celebrated at Easter,

553
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,820
 that he gets the death that you deserve

554
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,300
 and you get the life that he deserves.

555
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,600
 His righteousness is imputed to you,

556
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,380
 accredited to your account,

557
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,980
 that God sees you as righteous

558
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,480
 because his Son died in your place.

559
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,140
 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead

560
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,240
 is living in you,

561
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,420
 he who raised Christ from the dead,

562
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,100
 okay, I'm just reading this,

563
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,140
 but just in case, like you tuned out,

564
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,460
 tuned out, like lean in.

565
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,700
 He who raised Christ from the dead

566
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,140
 will also give life to your mortal bodies

567
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,460
 because of his Spirit who lives in you.

568
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,260
 Grasp now with me this profound reality

569
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,220
 that the same Spirit who brought Christ,

570
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,700
 who was dead, bloody, okay,

571
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
 puncture wound in his side,

572
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,520
 he bled out, he's been whipped to death,

573
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,600
 he hung crucified on a cross,

574
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,960
 he's now wrapped in all these burial clothes

575
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,020
 and put in a cave with a big stone in front of it.

576
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,000
 And then all of a sudden,

577
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,260
 this Spirit that's so powerful

578
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,860
 that it's like, (whooshing)

579
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,700
 and he's back.

580
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,060
 That Spirit lives in you.

581
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,320
 (congregation laughing)

582
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,160
 Just me?

583
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
 I'm like, serious?

584
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,560
 That Spirit lives in you.

585
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,740
 See, when the non-believer sins,

586
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,600
 that's just their job description.

587
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,920
 That's what verse nine and 10 are saying.

588
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,640
 They're just doing what they're supposed to do.

589
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,780
 But when a believer lives in sin,

590
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,660
 that's confusing because the Spirit of God

591
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,220
 does not live in sin.

592
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,080
 So my second point this evening is

593
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,500
 your driver determines your destination.

594
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,960
 Whosoever at the steering wheel,

595
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,280
 that determines where you go.

596
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,220
 You don't have to go the way of death.

597
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,540
 See, if you're a Christian,

598
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,380
 you have a ready, willing, and able driver in Christ.

599
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,220
 Jesus Christ, his Spirit lives with you.

600
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,120
 But if you have no desire to do the things of God,

601
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,400
 if you have no desire to go where God is leading,

602
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,920
 then you are most likely not a Christian.

603
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,540
 Like, if there's no desire in you to satisfy God,

604
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,120
 to go his way, to go where he's leading,

605
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,760
 to let him drive, then you are most likely

606
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
 do not have the Holy Spirit in you.

607
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,640
 You are not a Christian.

608
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 But if when you sin, you're grieved, you're saddened,

609
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,040
 you want to jump back on the path of righteousness,

610
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,080
 you want to pursue God, you've believed upon the gospel,

611
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,340
 that's a different story.

612
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,820
 Your driver determines your destination.

613
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,080
 A part of being gone these five weeks,

614
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,480
 Monica and I had the incredible opportunity to go to Israel.

615
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,680
 And so we did this tour in Israel,

616
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,680
 which was, I mean, just amazing, trip of a lifetime, truly.

617
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,300
 And we had this incredible driver,

618
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,960
 we're on this tour bus, you know, with friends,

619
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,000
 and the first thing that he would do

620
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,600
 when we'd get on the bus is he would punch

621
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,040
 in the destination in the GPS.

622
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,340
 That's what a good driver does.

623
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,440
 The driver starts with the destination in mind.

624
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,940
 He's like, okay, where do you guys want to go?

625
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,420
 Let me make sure that I take you there.

626
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,580
 Even if he knows the destination, he's putting it in,

627
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
 saying, hey, what are the right traffic routes to take?

628
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,980
 What are the rights to, how do I make sure

629
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,340
 that I get there in the right amount of time?

630
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,700
 You begin to punch in that destination.

631
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,780
 Well, the mind kind of works this way,

632
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,220
 kind of like a GPS system, right?

633
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,020
 When you've continued to go to the bars of Uptown,

634
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,780
 the bars of Sunday Square, the bars in Houston,

635
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,860
 wherever you're at, if you're listening somewhere else,

636
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,260
 when you continue to live the lifestyle of the world,

637
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,240
 the lifestyle that cannot please God, right,

638
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
 you're punching in those addresses,

639
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,200
 and what does a GPS system do?

640
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,560
 It begins to auto-populate.

641
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
 It's like, oh, you want me to go there?

642
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,040
 Oh, I know that place, like, let's go.

643
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
 Like, you put in the first two numbers of the address,

644
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,640
 it's like, oh, you want to go home?

645
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,840
 I know home.

646
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,680
 First two numbers of the address, it's like,

647
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,600
 oh, you want to go to work?

648
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
 I know work, I know that way.

649
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,740
 I'm ready to take you there.

650
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,760
 Put in the first two numbers of the strip club,

651
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,120
 like, oh, yeah, we've been there, let's go.

652
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,500
 Bar, let's go.

653
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,380
 Party, let's go, right?

654
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,660
 But what happens when you stop going to those places?

655
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,220
 It forgets those addresses.

656
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,820
 The spiritual life, you begin to put in new addresses.

657
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,380
 Elena said, I changed my Playmates in my playground,

658
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,300
 even where I live, she said.

659
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
 I begin to punch in new addresses,

660
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,260
 and the old addresses fell out,

661
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,380
 and the new addresses begin to populate the GPS,

662
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,360
 and that's where I wanted to go.

663
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,220
 Oh, you want to go to church?

664
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,460
 I know church, let's go to church.

665
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
 You want a fellowship with those friends?

666
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,340
 Okay, I know those friends, let's go with those friends.

667
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,180
 You want community?

668
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,080
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, I'm ready.

669
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,900
 And all of a sudden, you have a new life.

670
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,960
 Why, because you changed drivers.

671
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,100
 Now the Spirit's driving,

672
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,360
 it's taking you to different places, different destinations.

673
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,400
 The flesh desires to kill you.

674
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,460
 That's a weird statement, like, how is the flesh,

675
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,140
 I just keep saying, if you pursue the flesh,

676
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,700
 if you let the flesh drive, you're going to die.

677
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,540
 Why is this?

678
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,020
 Because everything the flesh wants

679
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,580
 hurts your relationship with God, which gives life.

680
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:25,080
 And so what is this death that comes from feeding the flesh?

681
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,840
 It's anxiety, it's exhaustion, anybody tired,

682
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,580
 it's hangovers, it's pregnancy scares, it's heartbreak.

683
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,040
 Oh, I can't go on, I feel like I can't go on.

684
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,160
 Like my whole life was wrapped up in Him,

685
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
 I just feel like I can't move on.

686
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,120
 It's guilt, it's shame, I feel bad,

687
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,440
 it's depression, it's despair.

688
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,480
 And maybe worse than all of those things is apathy.

689
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,020
 It's a life without meaning.

690
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,160
 You know what, I haven't done anything with my life

691
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,120
 that has eternal implications.

692
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,020
 No, I mean, I'm the king of the city.

693
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,900
 But in eternity, my life won't matter

694
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,000
 because I've lived my life for me.

695
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,740
 And I'm kind of like those dysfunctional people

696
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,780
 that he talked about.

697
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,180
 That's some of us, not all of us, but that's some of us.

698
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,620
 Some of us need to hear that.

699
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,420
 But we have a God, you have a driver that you can trust

700
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,140
 who's leading you to life.

701
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,820
 This is the good news, right?

702
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,700
 You have a driver that is ready, willing, and able in Christ

703
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
 and he's leading you to life.

704
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,140
 Some of you, if we've hung out together for a while,

705
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,620
 you know that I had a terrifying fear of flying,

706
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,300
 like a debilitating fear of flying.

707
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,540
 And that was really unfortunate

708
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,740
 because I had a job that required me to fly.

709
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,580
 And every time I'd get on that plane,

710
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,860
 you know, it was like my palms were sweaty, knees weak,

711
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,580
 arms were heavy, vomit on my sweater.

712
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,140
 No, and so every time I'd get on that plane,

713
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,980
 it was just like anxiety overwhelmed me, you know,

714
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,180
 and I'm sitting there.

715
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,140
 And until the moment, there was this really defining moment

716
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,660
 that changed everything.

717
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,660
 And it was a conversation with a pilot.

718
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,980
 And I was just like, man, when we hit turbulence,

719
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,460
 it feels like the wings are gonna fall off.

720
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,740
 He's like, the wings are gonna fall.

721
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,100
 I'm like, are you guys scared?

722
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,340
 He's like, turbulence?

723
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,940
 He's like, man, we're having fun.

724
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,860
 You know, most of us, like the airlines,

725
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,300
 they hire like ex-fighter pilots.

726
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,560
 Like, have you noticed the guys?

727
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,580
 Like, they're old guys.

728
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,780
 They're coming out of the army.

729
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,220
 They've been dog fighting and flying planes at like,

730
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,320
 who knows how faster than the, you know, sound barrier

731
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,060
 and breaking the sound barrier and all this.

732
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,000
 And he's like telling me this.

733
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,420
 He's like, when we hit turbulence,

734
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,660
 like that's the only part that we actually enjoy

735
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,380
 because like, we're like sleeping at the wheel.

736
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,620
 I'm like, well, that doesn't make me feel better.

737
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,300
 But he's like, man, we're up there like flying,

738
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,620
 you know, from this town, this city to this city.

739
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,460
 Like, that's boring.

740
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
 Like the turbulence, that's kind of fun.

741
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,420
 You know, I'm like, you're having fun.

742
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,380
 He's like, we're having fun.

743
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,660
 He's like, you think that plane's gonna fall out of the sky

744
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,020
 'cause of some bumps?

745
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,900
 And I was like, no, I wouldn't think that, you know.

746
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,100
 (congregation laughing)

747
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,820
 And it was just like that conversation.

748
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,780
 And so what happened is I began to look at the pilots.

749
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,360
 And I'm like, man, they had some gray hair.

750
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,240
 They had these like official shirts

751
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,160
 with these stripes on their sleeves.

752
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,020
 And I'm like, dude, these guys are pros.

753
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,940
 Like, they're really experienced.

754
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,100
 The God that you can trust is experienced.

755
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,500
 Like, you think that you're gonna bump up

756
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,980
 against something that he hasn't dealt with

757
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,260
 countless number of times?

758
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,780
 Like he's thrown for a loop?

759
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,300
 Like, you're like, God, I don't know what,

760
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,140
 I just got laid off and I know you don't know what to do.

761
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,500
 He's like, dude, you know how many people

762
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,720
 got laid off today and I'm taking care of them?

763
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,180
 Look at the birds of the air.

764
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,220
 It's like, God, he broke my heart.

765
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,840
 I know this has really thrown you for a loop.

766
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,540
 He's like, come on, man, I got you.

767
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,260
 I love you, I got a plan for you.

768
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,260
 You think I haven't been here a billion times?

769
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,900
 Do you trust me?

770
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,360
 Hand me the keys.

771
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,260
 Hand me the keys, let me drive, stop driving.

772
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:18,060
 God's spirit has a perfect track record, right?

773
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,100
 He can bring the dead, what's the worst

774
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,920
 that can happen to me?

775
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
 I can die?

776
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,460
 He's like, dude, I got that, I've been there.

777
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,400
 You know, see, also Easter, right?

778
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,920
 A life of trusting God's spirit,

779
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,980
 this comes straight from Galatians 5, 22 through 23,

780
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,100
 if you wanna write that down.

781
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,460
 A life of trusting God's spirit is a life

782
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,300
 full of love, joy, peace, patience,

783
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,140
 kindness, goodness, gentleness,

784
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,660
 faithfulness, and self-control.

785
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,080
 That's what God's spirit gives.

786
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,060
 That's where he leads.

787
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,100
 That's where he's driving you to.

788
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,660
 That's the one that you can trust.

789
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,620
 And so Paul is teaching us this incredibly valuable lesson

790
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,420
 that is simply this, your thoughts take you places.

791
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,340
 What you think about is taking you somewhere.

792
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,140
 And it's different destinations.

793
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,080
 Destinations in this world, right?

794
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,660
 You have never, ever found yourself in sin

795
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,500
 without first thinking about it.

796
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,020
 No one in the history of existence has sinned, right,

797
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,240
 without thinking about it,

798
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,820
 have some thought start in their mind

799
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,940
 and it carries them there.

800
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,860
 James says this in chapter one, verse 14,

801
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,460
 that it begins, every sin begins with our own desire,

802
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,340
 a desire within us that takes us there.

803
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,760
 And so different destinations in this world,

804
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,020
 but also different destinations in the afterlife.

805
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,700
 Here's what I mean by that.

806
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,060
 Your thoughts point to ultimately who you've trusted in,

807
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,420
 whether that's yourself or Christ,

808
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,700
 his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins.

809
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,480
 And so you might say, well, I can't control my thoughts, JP.

810
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,040
 I can't stop sinning.

811
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,200
 I'm a Christian and I can't stop committing the same sin.

812
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,720
 And I'm just like, what?

813
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,720
 You're telling me that the spirit who gave life to Christ,

814
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,080
 the one who busted open the tomb, who defeated death,

815
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,320
 that same spirit can't help you stop looking at porn?

816
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,700
 What is he broken?

817
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,160
 He's not working for you?

818
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,380
 That same spirit can't help you stop obsessing

819
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,820
 about a relationship?

820
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,860
 Like he can bring Jesus back to life,

821
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,460
 but he's just stumped at the fact

822
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,260
 that you're obsessed with your body.

823
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,900
 Oh man, it's the spirit who brought Christ to life

824
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
 that lives with you.

825
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,780
 Have you tried surrendering to him?

826
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,180
 God, I can't, but you can.

827
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,720
 God, I've tried everything.

828
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,160
 Covenant Eyes, XXX Church, accountability, community.

829
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,680
 I've tried community membership.

830
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,640
 I've tried membership.

831
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,500
 I've tried everything.

832
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,540
 Cool, have you tried trusting me?

833
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,020
 Have you tried surrendering?

834
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:28,380
 Sometimes, just to say this,

835
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,260
 kind of doesn't even address here,

836
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,740
 but I met with some of you recently

837
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,180
 who are like obsessed with conjuring up the spirit of God

838
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,020
 for the gifts of the spirit.

839
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,420
 You know, I'm speaking tongues.

840
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,940
 I'm like, cool, but man, you know that,

841
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,300
 like you're stuck in pornography,

842
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,420
 and that doesn't honor God.

843
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,900
 And so, man, maybe you could switch out tongues

844
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,940
 for putting to death the deeds of the flesh.

845
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,500
 Like we get so excited about conjuring up

846
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
 the gifts of the spirit.

847
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,580
 He's like, hey man, how about long obedience

848
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,720
 in the same direction?

849
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,260
 How about trusting me for a change?

850
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,380
 How about handing me the keys to your life

851
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,580
 and letting me drive?

852
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,180
 How about submitting to authority?

853
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,500
 How about coming into a church and belonging

854
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,920
 like I clearly asked you to in my word?

855
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,020
 How about trusting my spirit in that way

856
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,520
 and stop treating me like a genie or a party trick?

857
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,140
 Verse 12.

858
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,320
 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation.

859
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,780
 We have an obligation, but this obligation,

860
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,860
 it's not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.

861
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,460
 That's not what we're obligated to do.

862
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,340
 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.

863
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,380
 But if by the spirit you put to death

864
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,380
 the misdeeds of the body, you will live.

865
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,780
 Jesus says you will have life and have it to the foolish.

866
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,660
 You will have life and have it abundantly.

867
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,620
 Following God is not a cop-out.

868
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,780
 It's where the real party is.

869
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,620
 And I'm not naive.

870
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,860
 Like just in case we don't know each other,

871
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,340
 like I partied.

872
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,660
 Like I probably partied as hard as any one of you

873
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,340
 in this room right now, okay?

874
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,800
 And so I'm not crazy.

875
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,160
 I'm not brainwashed by the church.

876
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,880
 I'm telling you life is found in Jesus

877
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,540
 and Jesus alone, nowhere else.

878
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,700
 That's what Elena told you too.

879
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,540
 Like she's not up here.

880
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,360
 We didn't brainwash her.

881
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,140
 We didn't have her drink some Kool-Aid or something.

882
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,940
 Like she's just like, hey, I found something good.

883
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,500
 I wanna tell you guys about it.

884
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,740
 And so my third and final point is designate a driver.

885
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,180
 Designate a driver, your flesh or God's spirit.

886
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,860
 You choose.

887
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,300
 Tonight, you get to say, hey, who's gonna drive

888
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,260
 the rest of my life?

889
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,380
 Designate a driver because you are obligated to your driver.

890
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,300
 And if you're choosing the spirit,

891
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,660
 you're obligated then to put to death

892
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,800
 the deeds of the flesh.

893
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,740
 So you have the help of the same spirit

894
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,700
 who raised Christ from the dead.

895
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,420
 Now listen, your flesh is gonna wanna continue to drive.

896
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,260
 It's just like Weston, crazy in a good way.

897
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,380
 No, but the flesh isn't.

898
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,360
 I was just saying my son, I felt bad for calling him crazy.

899
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,980
 So my son's not crazy.

900
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,060
 Your flesh is crazy.

901
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,020
 Now we're clear.

902
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,100
 Your flesh wants to kill you.

903
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,700
 It wants the steering wheel,

904
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,820
 but it wants to drive you off a cliff

905
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,740
 if that has not been crystal clear.

906
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,100
 I hope that you leave with that.

907
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,900
 And so you must make it a practice

908
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,060
 to surrender your thoughts to the spirit,

909
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,560
 not to dwell on what the flesh desires,

910
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,780
 not to watch movies that feed your flesh,

911
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,360
 not to watch shows that feed your flesh,

912
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,220
 not to listen to music that feeds your flesh.

913
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,940
 I know that sounds legalistic and kind of,

914
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,900
 man, you just kind of went where the church I grew up in.

915
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,260
 I'm not trying to, I'm just telling you,

916
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,820
 there is some truth to that.

917
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,140
 You are feeding your mind and it's feeding your desires.

918
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,900
 And you listen to a song and it's all of a sudden,

919
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,820
 it's like, man, I want everything that song said.

920
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,660
 You watch a show and it's like,

921
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,880
 man, I want everything that show just showed.

922
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,540
 I want 24 guys chasing me, right?

923
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,500
 It's like, what?

924
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,540
 It's crazy.

925
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,860
 But as you walk by the spirit,

926
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,860
 as you walk by the spirit,

927
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,960
 you're closer to heaven with every step.

928
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,280
 That's a beautiful reality.

929
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,020
 As you walk by the spirit,

930
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,340
 he is leading you to a destination,

931
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,500
 which is eternity with God,

932
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,240
 and you're closer to it with every step.

933
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,900
 The other day, a couple of weeks ago,

934
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,860
 we went to Six Flags, took the kids to Six Flags.

935
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,700
 They had never been and it's a big deal.

936
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,540
 They're excited.

937
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,420
 And as we got close to Six Flags,

938
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,380
 if you've been there, you know, like from far off,

939
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,580
 you can see the tops of the roller coaster.

940
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,860
 And it's so interesting.

941
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,940
 The second they saw the tops of the roller coaster,

942
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,660
 all of the joy and all of the excitement

943
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,860
 of being in the amusement park was now in the car.

944
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,460
 It's like, we see it.

945
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,780
 We're gonna get to ride that.

946
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,620
 We're going.

947
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,440
 And with every turn,

948
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,180
 we were closer to those roller coasters.

949
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,420
 They became bigger and more real and closer to us.

950
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,300
 With every rotation of the tire,

951
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,700
 we were closer to our destination.

952
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,700
 And the excitement of the destination filled the car

953
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,460
 until like one moment,

954
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,100
 we're at the kind of toll booth where you pay to park.

955
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,540
 And the next moment we're in the park.

956
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,220
 It was just a natural progression.

957
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,220
 When you walk the spiritual life by the spirit,

958
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,260
 when you die and you pass from this world to eternity

959
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,540
 in the presence of God, also known as heaven,

960
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,420
 it's just the next natural progression.

961
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,460
 You've been looking at it with every step

962
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,980
 and the excitement and anticipation of eternity with God

963
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,640
 at glorification is filling your life.

964
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,620
 And the joy that comes from that is now in your world.

965
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,420
 And every step you take with the spirit

966
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
 in the driver's seat is taking you there.

967
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,940
 And the excitement builds as you move closer

968
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,340
 to eternity with God.

969
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,480
 So much so that when your heart stops beating,

970
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,340
 it's just the next natural step to eternity life with God,

971
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,060
 to eternity with God, to eternal life with God.

972
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,380
 It's just the next thing.

973
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,820
 It's just where the spirit has been taking you

974
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,860
 since you were 21, since you were 32,

975
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,860
 since you were 40, 56, 77, 83,

976
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,460
 hello Jesus.

977
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,780
 It's just where you are.

978
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,040
 That's allowing the spirit to drive.

979
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,740
 And so we're experiencing more and more of him

980
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,020
 where real life is found.

981
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,860
 And the flesh simply desires to take you off course.

982
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
 And so what's the application, real quick?

983
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,020
 The application is simply letting the spirit drive.

984
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,380
 And you say, well, how do I do that?

985
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,520
 It's verse five, live in accordance with the spirit.

986
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,140
 It's filling your mind with God's instruction.

987
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,540
 Here's a thing, it's meditation.

988
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,100
 And you say, well, meditation, really?

989
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,420
 See, I think we've been confused on what meditation is.

990
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,980
 Eastern meditation is emptying your mind.

991
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,700
 It's not thinking about anything.

992
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,620
 Biblical meditation is filling your mind

993
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,580
 with the things of God, the truths of God,

994
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,280
 learning the scriptures of God,

995
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,100
 yielding to the spirit of God.

996
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,140
 Biblical meditation is not at all emptying your mind

997
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,480
 but filling it so that when you fill your mind

998
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,440
 with the things of God,

999
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,700
 you filled your life with the things of God.

1000
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,820
 You are the things of God.

1001
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,880
 And it begins with you filling your mind

1002
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,000
 with the things of God.

1003
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,320
 This is what it looks like to let the spirit drive.

1004
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,680
 And so in summary, there's a fight

1005
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,380
 for the driver's seat of your mind

1006
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,920
 between the flesh and the spirit.

1007
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,800
 And your driver determines your destination

1008
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
 both in this world and the world to come.

1009
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,080
 And so tonight, I'm admonishing you,

1010
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,340
 I'm exhorting you to designate a driver,

1011
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,360
 your flesh or God's spirit.

1012
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,800
 I wanna end in a way that it's really

1013
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,160
 how I wanted to start.

1014
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,560
 I didn't wanna distract you.

1015
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,480
 But the other day I was on Twitter

1016
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,820
 and a friend of mine had,

1017
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,680
 I was reading a tweet from a friend

1018
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,840
 and it had a hashtag and it was a curious hashtag.

1019
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,880
 It wasn't an immoral hashtag in any way.

1020
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,000
 It was just a curious hashtag

1021
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,840
 and my flesh began to wonder

1022
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,440
 what's on the other side of that hashtag

1023
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,600
 and so I clicked on it.

1024
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,560
 I scrolled with my, on my phone,

1025
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
 my iPhone, I scrolled down

1026
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,160
 and I felt that kind of excitement

1027
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,400
 wondering if I was gonna see something,

1028
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
 maybe a girl in a bathing suit,

1029
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,640
 something like that and I didn't.

1030
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,200
 But I saw another hashtag

1031
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,280
 and my flesh wondered what's behind this hashtag,

1032
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,600
 maybe something more promising

1033
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,800
 and so I clicked on it and I scrolled

1034
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720
 and I saw nudity.

1035
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,440
 I saw a topless woman

1036
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,000
 and I kind of woke up, if you will,

1037
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,280
 I kind of came to, I was like startled

1038
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,240
 and I knew it wasn't like I had done that accidentally.

1039
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,960
 I knew that there was a huge part of me

1040
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,280
 that was seeking that out and I was so grieved

1041
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,600
 because it's been years since I had pursued pornography

1042
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,920
 and there I was in that moment,

1043
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,200
 I found myself back in that place.

1044
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
 How did I get here?

1045
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,000
 And the shame and the guilt

1046
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 and everything came back in that moment.

1047
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,880
 And by the grace of God, I put my phone down,

1048
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,080
 I go to my computer, I didn't act out on it

1049
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,480
 any further than that but I go and I email my guys

1050
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
 and I say, hey, I want you to know what I just did.

1051
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,880
 I sought this out

1052
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,720
 and I walked them through the same process

1053
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,760
 that I just walked you through.

1054
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,120
 I clicked here, I didn't see something,

1055
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,380
 I went further in and I found something.

1056
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,680
 I said, will you pray for me

1057
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,320
 that I would forget it, that I'd be free?

1058
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,120
 Monica got home, my wife got home

1059
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,760
 and said, baby, sit down, I need to talk to you.

1060
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,600
 She said, what's wrong?

1061
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,320
 I said, I want you to know what I just did.

1062
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,800
 I told her.

1063
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,840
 All the while, my flesh is like, you can't tell her.

1064
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,640
 Like, she's gonna, you can't do that.

1065
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,120
 I put to death the teeth of the flesh.

1066
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,640
 Monica, this is what I did, will you please forgive me?

1067
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,200
 And then shortly thereafter, I was with a group of pastors.

1068
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,320
 We were meeting to pray and to dream about the church.

1069
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,480
 I said, guys, before we go further, we were at a meal.

1070
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,560
 I said, I want you to know what I've done.

1071
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
 I told them.

1072
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,660
 I want to tell you.

1073
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,000
 I don't want to be a hypocrite over here,

1074
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,400
 like, hey, don't give in to the ways of the flesh.

1075
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,600
 I gave in to the ways of the flesh.

1076
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,640
 Would you guys please forgive me?

1077
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,080
 As your pastor, I don't want to be a fraud.

1078
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,740
 I don't want to preach one thing and do another.

1079
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,140
 Would you please forgive me?

1080
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,000
 Would you please forgive me?

1081
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,840
 I'm asking.

1082
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,120
 Thank you.

1083
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,200
 Thank you.

1084
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,760
 I want you to know how I got there.

1085
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,620
 It wasn't a long strategic plan.

1086
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,840
 It wasn't something premeditated the day before.

1087
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,100
 It was in a moment my flesh opened the driver's side door

1088
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,500
 and said, hey, scoot over.

1089
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,940
 Let me drive for a few minutes, a few seconds.

1090
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,020
 Let me drive.

1091
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,720
 I found myself off a cliff.

1092
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,840
 Not trying to avoid being culpable, it was me.

1093
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,160
 It was the part of me that loves to sin.

1094
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,340
 It was the part of me that grieved the Spirit.

1095
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,700
 It was this part of me that wanted the steering wheel.

1096
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,660
 It was the part of me that can't honor God.

1097
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,820
 It was the part of me that Christ died for.

1098
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,500
 It was the part of me that has found freedom in Him.

1099
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,180
 And so,

1100
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,220
 tonight, with you, I designate the Holy Spirit

1101
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,560
 as driver of my life.

1102
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,200
 And I want you to do the same.

1103
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,480
 And I want you to meet a friend of mine

1104
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,700
 who also has done that.

1105
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:36,520
 - My name's Phillip Ward,

1106
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,600
 and my life before Christ was a lie.

1107
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,440
 I grew up in a Christian home, went to church on Sundays,

1108
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,960
 but I thought Jesus was just a complete fairy tale.

1109
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,160
 And so, because I thought Jesus was a fairy tale,

1110
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,480
 I lived my life like there were no consequences.

1111
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,280
 I started DJing when I was in eighth grade,

1112
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,760
 and I had dreams of just becoming the next big music mogul.

1113
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,880
 I wanted to be just like Diddy.

1114
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,200
 That was my goal.

1115
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,880
 And so, I was introduced into the music industry

1116
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,200
 after college.

1117
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,880
 A friend that I was managing, an artist,

1118
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,240
 signed a record deal,

1119
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,240
 and the song went big on the Billboard charts.

1120
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,720
 And so, we were everywhere.

1121
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,960
 We were touring across the country.

1122
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,800
 So, sex, alcohol, and drugs,

1123
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,480
 they were all readily available at my fingertips

1124
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,240
 whenever I wanted.

1125
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
 And I did not deny myself.

1126
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,800
 I lived it, and I was there.

1127
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,380
 The clubs, the lights, the fast money,

1128
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,860
 the fame, the vainglory,

1129
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,300
 I drank from that cup deeply,

1130
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,320
 but still I thirsted for more.

1131
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,840
 For years, I chased for more.

1132
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,440
 Why?

1133
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,320
 Because I knew.

1134
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,200
 I knew it deep down, it would never be enough.

1135
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,680
 Never enough money, never enough fame,

1136
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,880
 never enough sex, never enough drugs.

1137
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,560
 It's never enough.

1138
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,560
 And in 2013, I got brought to this place, to the porch.

1139
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,080
 And I was the guy who would come to church

1140
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,400
 just to take a picture for social media,

1141
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,680
 to share so people would think that I was a good guy.

1142
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,400
 And so, I wasn't.

1143
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,440
 But I kept coming back because never in my life

1144
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,000
 had I heard someone passionately speak

1145
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,440
 about how broken they were before Christ

1146
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,560
 and drive home the point

1147
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,120
 that there was no life outside of Christ.

1148
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,940
 I thought, this guy, JP, he's been where I've been.

1149
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,760
 He really believes this.

1150
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,000
 He really believes this Jesus thing.

1151
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,120
 And so, one Tuesday night broke me.

1152
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,880
 I was sitting about right there.

1153
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,080
 And JP from the stage, he screamed out,

1154
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,400
 "You're not a Christian, you're not a Christian,

1155
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,840
 "you're not a Christian."

1156
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,760
 And I sank into my seat.

1157
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,040
 And that was the first time I realized I'm not a Christian.

1158
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,520
 And so, I began a mission to get to the truth.

1159
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
 Did Jesus really die for my sins?

1160
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,360
 Did he even exist?

1161
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,900
 And did he rise?

1162
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,520
 And what I found, yes, he did.

1163
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,160
 And I gave up everything.

1164
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,480
 I completely left the world I was living in

1165
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,520
 because what else can you do

1166
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,000
 when you meet a guy who can defeat death but follow him?

1167
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,160
 And so, now, my life with Christ

1168
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,680
 has been a radical transformation.

1169
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,020
 Saturday actually marked two years

1170
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,160
 since I've trusted in Christ.

1171
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,820
 And I finally found the one thing that is enough, Jesus.

1172
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,240
 Because of the cross, I've been set free

1173
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,240
 from chasing after sex, alcohol, drugs, fame.

1174
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,980
 My mission now is to make him famous for who he is

1175
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,880
 and what he's done.

1176
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,700
 Let's pray.

1177
00:50:52,700 --> 00:51:02,920
 God, thank you for being the good driver in our lives.

1178
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:09,000
 Lord, I pray for the souls in here who don't know who he is.

1179
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,280
 I pray that tonight someone will realize

1180
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,080
 that they are not a Christian and they will come forward

1181
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:19,880
 and trust in the one and only hope that we have, Jesus.

1182
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,160
 Lord, I pray for all my friends

1183
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,260
 who have the spirit and joy in them,

1184
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,240
 that they would run after you.

1185
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,960
 That we would put to death the deeds of the flesh,

1186
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,600
 that we would trust in you more.

1187
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,720
 Lord, I pray that you would continue to work in hearts

1188
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,560
 and broken men and women to change lives

1189
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,800
 and to tell stories of grace.

1190
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
 Would you continue to work through us?

1191
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,320
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1192
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,520
 The Holy Spirit, I don't wanna belittle

1193
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,620
 the Holy Spirit at all with this metaphor,

1194
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,040
 but I was thinking about it as we were singing.

1195
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,800
 And he's like a driver.

1196
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,240
 I mean, that's been the metaphor throughout this evening.

1197
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,720
 And when I was thinking about drivers,

1198
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,120
 like professional drivers,

1199
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,880
 they love people who can't drive.

1200
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,520
 Like their whole job security depends on it, right?

1201
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,560
 And so if you're here and you look at your life

1202
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,320
 and you're like, man, you don't understand.

1203
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,840
 Like I'm a terrible driver.

1204
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,240
 I mean, I've done things

1205
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,960
 that I can't even get out of my mouth.

1206
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,560
 I can't even say the words.

1207
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,320
 Like God delights in forgiving you.

1208
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,120
 Like it brings him great joy to restore you,

1209
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,240
 to take an incredible sinner

1210
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,520
 and make him or her an amazing saint for eternity.

1211
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,800
 And it's his work, not yours.

1212
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,120
 You don't need to leave here with any guilt,

1213
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,440
 with any shame.

1214
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,840
 In a moment, all your sins can be forgiven.

1215
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,760
 Forgiven by trusting in what Christ has done on the cross,

1216
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,660
 his finished work.

1217
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,520
 Like my friend said so eloquently tonight,

1218
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,520
 it is finished, paid for, done.

1219
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:09,600
 That's what we just celebrated.

1220
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,040
 And so I would clap if I were you.

1221
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,540
 (congregation applauding)

1222
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,920
 Philip said a lot of JP.

1223
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
 JP's a fool.

1224
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,040
 JP will chase some hashtags, man.

1225
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,720
 I just know a great God.

1226
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,080
 And I want you to know a great God

1227
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,200
 who will set you free,

1228
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,200
 who will course correct your life in a moment.

1229
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,080
 Talked a lot about the Holy Spirit tonight.

1230
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,420
 The Holy Spirit speaks to you in three ways.

1231
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,920
 The most sure, most confident way, his word.

1232
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,280
 The written word of God.

1233
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,560
 His people in prayer.

1234
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,980
 That quiet voice within you.

1235
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,800
 But all three of those ways he speaks to us,

1236
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,120
 the word says.

1237
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,040
 And so if you're not surrounded by his people,

1238
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,800
 you have hushed the Holy Spirit.

1239
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,280
 You have quieted God in your life.

1240
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,520
 You've asked him to be silent in this avenue.

1241
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,760
 And so every Tuesday we give you a way to do that

1242
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,280
 in open community groups.

1243
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,680
 And so if you wanna hear more about what it looks like

1244
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,000
 to belong to a community group,

1245
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,840
 guys, you can walk down this hallway

1246
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,480
 and there's a room full of men

1247
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,240
 who would love to talk with you about that.

1248
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,960
 Ladies, you walk down this hallway

1249
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,840
 and there's a room out there full of women

1250
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,560
 who would love to talk with you about that.

1251
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,480
 It's a joy to travel with you through Romans 8.

1252
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,440
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
