1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,800
 - I wanna start just by sharing with you,

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,280
 I love coming back to the porch

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,040
 because it brings me back to Dallas and I'm from Dallas.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,440
 And so I went to high school,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,800
 I graduated from high school just down the street

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,880
 at Highland Park High School.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,640
 Don't judge me, that's just, that's where my family lives.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,760
 So that's where I went.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,000
 But as I was preparing for tonight,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,160
 I decided to bring this newspaper, "The Bagpipe,"

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,000
 which was a Highland Park High School publication.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,240
 And it was a senior issue

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,280
 where they included the senior poll.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,200
 Your high school might've had a senior poll,

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,760
 but this is where they have a bunch of different categories

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,780
 and they rank people in the class, different things.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,920
 I just wanna share with you what I was rated.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,280
 Okay, I was rated three different things.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,080
 Okay, the first thing that I was rated

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
 is I took third place in the category of just plain nice.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,120
 So here's what that means.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,680
 There was two people who were nicer than me at Highland Park

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,160
 but then I was nicer than about 376 other people.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,000
 So that's a big deal, no big deal, but it's a big deal.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 I also took third place in most sincere,

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,840
 which means that there was people

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,400
 who didn't fake it as much as I did.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,360
 And so they took the first two spots,

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,760
 but then I was more sincere than the rest of the class.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,360
 And then this one stung a little,

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,160
 but it just was the reality.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,600
 I took second place in most religious.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,860
 Like there was someone who beat me.

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,300
 I'm like, how do you like me now?

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,040
 If you could just see what I'm doing now,

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
 I promise you first spot would go to this guy.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,760
 Anyway, as I look back on what I was rated,

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,040
 I think that it can just be summed up

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,000
 that people saw me as a good guy.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,720
 It was like, there's Timothy Atik.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
 He's a good guy.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,560
 Girls were like, Timothy Atik's the kind of guy

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
 you wanna marry, which was a subtle slap in the face

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,720
 'cause it was like, we don't want you now,

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,600
 but see me in about 15 years.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,040
 But the point was like, hey, he's a good guy.

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 And then I went to A&M and I think most people,

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,240
 not everyone, but most people would say,

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
 yeah, he was a good guy.

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
 Like he was nice to people.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,960
 He went to church on Sundays.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,200
 Like as far as we know, Timothy Atik was a good guy.

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,120
 And even now living in College Station,

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
 like I coach my kids' soccer teams.

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
 I send meals to people when they have a baby.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,520
 Like I think people would look and be like,

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
 I think he's a good guy.

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,120
 But here's the deal.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,260
 I don't wanna be known as just a good guy.

61
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,640
 I wanna be known as a godly guy.

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,920
 And that's what I want for you.

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,400
 I don't want you to just settle for being known

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
 as being a good guy or girl.

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,440
 I want you to know or be known as being a godly guy

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
 or a godly woman.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,840
 Like if you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ,

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,840
 do not ever exit at just being a good guy or girl.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
 Here's why.

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
 Listen to what Peter tells us in 2 Peter 1, verse 3.

71
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 He says his, that's God's divine power,

72
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,200
 has given us everything we need for a godly life.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,440
 So do you hear what that's saying?

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
 God has given us everything that we need for a godly life.

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,020
 So if God in his limitless, matchless power

76
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,120
 is giving us everything we need to live godly lives,

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,120
 why would we ever be okay just being good or good enough

78
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,760
 when we can be godly?

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,460
 Let me tell you what I'm really talking about tonight.

80
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,040
 I'm talking about moving from Jesus being a part

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,940
 of your life to being the passion of your life.

82
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,440
 Like why would you settle for just a little flicker

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
 of a flame for Jesus when you can be white hot?

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,160
 That's what he desires for you.

85
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,200
 And that's where the most joy and the most life is found.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,840
 And so here's what I'm gonna do tonight.

87
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,100
 I'm gonna give you four keys

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,600
 to moving from good to godly.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,360
 And I'm gonna do it by stepping into the life of King David.

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,820
 If you have a Bible, turn with me tonight

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,080
 to 2 Samuel chapter six.

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 2 Samuel chapter six is where we are going to be tonight.

93
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,180
 2 Samuel chapter six, and if you're new to the Bible,

94
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,520
 then you still might be familiar with King David

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,160
 because you might have heard of the story

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,660
 of David and Goliath.

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,800
 We use that as analogies for all sorts of things

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,760
 anytime the little guy is up against the big guy.

99
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,840
 But there is so much more to the life of King David.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,880
 He was the second king ever of the nation of Israel.

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,200
 The first king was a guy named Saul,

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,720
 and God saw him as a mediocre king.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
 And so God replaced him with David.

104
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
 He dubbed David the man after my own heart.

105
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
 That's who David was, is he was a man after God's own heart.

106
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,320
 That's the type of guy that we should want to learn from

107
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,440
 as followers of Jesus Christ.

108
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,840
 David was the best king that Israel ever saw.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
 He led the nation to a point

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,280
 where it was the dominating force throughout the world.

111
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,740
 David was God's man sitting on the throne.

112
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,280
 And we're gonna step into a story that when you hear it,

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,600
 you're gonna be like, this feels super outdated.

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,360
 Remember, we're looking at a story that took place

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,500
 in the ancient Near East.

116
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,960
 But what I need you to understand is that David

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,080
 is early on in his reign in Israel.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,520
 And what he is doing just right out of the gate

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,320
 is he is showing us what he's gonna prioritize in his life,

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,360
 which is good as we read it for you as a young adult

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,120
 to just evaluate, am I prioritizing

122
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,740
 the right things in my life?

123
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,260
 You might be prioritizing things to be known

124
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,000
 as a good guy or a good girl,

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,440
 but there's a big difference between a Christian boy

126
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,360
 and a godly man.

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,880
 Don't you want to be a godly man or a godly woman?

128
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,460
 Do not settle for anything less

129
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,960
 if you consider yourself a follower of Jesus Christ.

130
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
 And so we're gonna look at a story

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,740
 early on in David's reign.

132
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,440
 And again, it's gonna feel very outdated,

133
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,440
 but I assure you this story is extremely relevant to today.

134
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,820
 Second Samuel, chapter six, let me read you

135
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,540
 verses one through 11, track along with me.

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,700
 It says this.

137
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,760
 "David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel,

138
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,860
 "30,000, and David arose and went with all the people

139
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,780
 "who were with him from Baal Judah

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,200
 "to bring up from there the Ark of God,

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,280
 "which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts,

142
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,780
 "who sits enthroned on the cherubim.

143
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,440
 "And they carried the Ark of God on a new cart

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,020
 "and brought it out of the house of Abinadab,

145
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,700
 "which was on the hill.

146
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,560
 "In Uzzah, in Ahio, the sons of Abinadab

147
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,100
 "were driving the new cart with the Ark of God,

148
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,920
 "and Ahio went before the Ark.

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,960
 "And David and all the house of Israel

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,800
 "were celebrating before the Lord

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,960
 "with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines

152
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,740
 "and castanets and cymbals.

153
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,280
 "And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon,

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
 "Uzzah put out his hand to the Ark of God

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,880
 "and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled,

156
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,540
 "and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah.

157
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,940
 "And God struck him down there because of his error,

158
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,740
 "and he died there beside the Ark of God.

159
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,760
 "And David was angry because the Lord

160
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,580
 "had broken out against Uzzah.

161
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,020
 "And that place is called Perez-Uzzah to this day.

162
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,040
 "And David was afraid of the Lord that day,

163
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,200
 "and he said, 'How can the Ark of the Lord come to me?'

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,000
 "So David was not willing to take the Ark of the Lord

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,020
 "into the city of David, but David took it aside

166
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,140
 "to the house of Obed-edom, the Gittite.

167
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,700
 "And the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom,

168
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,100
 "the Gittite, three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom

169
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,780
 "and all of his household."

170
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,020
 So I'm giving you four keys to moving from good to godly.

171
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,620
 The first is this, prioritize God's presence.

172
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,060
 I hope you're taking notes.

173
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,660
 Anytime God wants to speak, you write it down.

174
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,180
 Like, don't leave it to your mind to just remember

175
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,580
 that's not what your brain is for.

176
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,600
 Write it down, okay?

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,220
 The first thing, moving from good to godly

178
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,060
 is prioritize God's presence.

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,740
 This is a story about David moving the Ark of God.

180
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,500
 And if you're new to the Bible and you hear the word Ark,

181
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,860
 you might be thinking that we're talking about a boat

182
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,620
 because all you know about is Noah's Ark.

183
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,700
 We're not talking about a boat at all.

184
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,340
 When we talk about the Ark of God,

185
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,280
 another name for it in the scriptures

186
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,140
 is the Ark of the Covenant.

187
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,340
 I don't have time to give you all the background

188
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
 of the Ark of the Covenant.

189
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,020
 It was the most important piece of furniture

190
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,460
 in the nation of Israel.

191
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,540
 And the reason it was so important

192
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,140
 is because the Ark of the Covenant,

193
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,700
 it was this four foot by two and a half foot wooden box

194
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,660
 that symbolized the presence of God.

195
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,420
 Like, the presence of God was said to reside

196
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,260
 right on top of the box.

197
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,580
 And if you're new to Christianity or the Bible,

198
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,380
 all of this is gonna sound very weird to you,

199
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
 but all I need you to understand

200
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,600
 is that the Ark of the Covenant was said to be the place

201
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,760
 where God's presence resided, okay?

202
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,520
 Now, what you need to know

203
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,520
 is that David's predecessor, Saul,

204
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,400
 allowed the Ark of God, the Ark of the Covenant,

205
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,180
 to remain in a place where it didn't belong.

206
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,140
 See, the Ark of the Covenant was put in the tabernacle

207
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,820
 or the temple, which is the meeting place of God.

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,600
 And David tells us this about his predecessor,

209
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,220
 1 Chronicles 13, three.

210
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,060
 He says, "Let us bring again the Ark of our God to us,

211
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,820
 "for we did not seek it in the days of Saul."

212
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,700
 So Saul was the king that went before him.

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,660
 And what's David saying?

214
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,940
 He's saying, "For about 20 years,

215
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,900
 "we didn't care about God's presence."

216
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,640
 Like, if the Ark of the Covenant

217
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,980
 is where God's presence resides,

218
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,020
 we didn't care about it for 20 years.

219
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,020
 And that's gonna change with my rule.

220
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,540
 And so right out of the gate, what David is saying is,

221
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,020
 "We're bringing the Ark of the Covenant back,

222
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,060
 "and we're putting it in the capital city.

223
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,960
 "We're putting it where it belongs,

224
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,760
 "because we are going to prioritize God's presence.

225
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,180
 "His presence will live in the midst of the people."

226
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,100
 And so you just think about that.

227
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,740
 That was his priority.

228
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,540
 He prioritized the presence of God.

229
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,580
 If you wanna move from good to godly,

230
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,740
 I would encourage you to do the same thing,

231
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,700
 to prioritize God's presence.

232
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,660
 The interesting thing is that,

233
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,980
 if you've never heard of the Ark of the Covenant,

234
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,340
 there's probably a reason,

235
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,140
 because the Ark of the Covenant isn't important anymore.

236
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,260
 And the reason why it isn't important

237
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
 is because Jesus Christ

238
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,060
 has made the Ark of the Covenant irrelevant.

239
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,580
 See, in the ancient Near East,

240
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,460
 one guy was able to get close to the Ark of the Covenant,

241
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,460
 once a year, to step into the presence of God.

242
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,580
 And when Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross,

243
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,460
 and when he rose from the dead,

244
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,580
 he did away with all of that,

245
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,220
 making a path for every single one of us

246
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,340
 to live in the presence of God.

247
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,860
 And so I just tell you that today,

248
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,540
 you have access to the God of the universe,

249
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,820
 the King of kings and Lord of lords.

250
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,500
 Prioritize his presence.

251
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,260
 Here's what I wanna ask you to think about.

252
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,020
 Can you think of a time in your life,

253
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,980
 can you look back and be like, oh yeah, God was there?

254
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,780
 Like, is there a time in your past where you're like,

255
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,780
 you know what, at that one porch, God was there?

256
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,100
 Or you know what, when I went to that camp,

257
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,740
 or when I went to that conference,

258
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,140
 or when I was in that dark place in my life,

259
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,020
 you know what, God was there.

260
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,940
 Like there's different times in my life

261
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,140
 where I can look back and be like,

262
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,020
 God was absolutely there.

263
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,100
 Like when my life hit rock bottom shortly after college,

264
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,220
 when I was living in sin, you know what, God was there.

265
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,140
 When my son went into the NICU when he was born,

266
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,420
 God was there.

267
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,060
 When my wife and I lost a child to miscarriage,

268
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,460
 you know what, God met us there.

269
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,140
 There's these significant moments in my life

270
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,380
 that I can look back and be like, God was there.

271
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,500
 And I would imagine that many people here

272
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,380
 can look back in the past and be like, yeah, God was there.

273
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,220
 But here's what I'm afraid of.

274
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,700
 I'm afraid of getting to heaven and getting perspective

275
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,260
 and being like, oh, God was there a lot more

276
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,420
 than I realized.

277
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,580
 Like, so he was there in my home office every single morning

278
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,180
 and he was there when I was driving to work in the morning

279
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,620
 and he was there when I was on the soccer field

280
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,260
 with my kids and he was there when I was on date

281
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,300
 night with my wife and he was there

282
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,780
 when I didn't know what to do.

283
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,700
 And he was there when I was really stressed out

284
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,740
 and he was there when I was making dumb decisions.

285
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,300
 I don't want to get perspective and be like,

286
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,980
 oh, God was not just there in the magnificent times

287
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,660
 or the monumental times, God was there in the mundane times.

288
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,820
 So what I'm telling you when I talk about prioritizing

289
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,500
 God's presence is I'm talking about stopping this desire

290
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,580
 to get back to someplace.

291
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,980
 Like if I could just get back to that place in my life

292
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,580
 where God was there in transitioning to the mindset

293
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,740
 of God is here.

294
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,660
 Like to just live in that reality that when you wake up

295
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,060
 tomorrow morning, before you even put your feet

296
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
 on the ground, you know what?

297
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
 God's here in the room with me.

298
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,060
 That God's driving with you to work.

299
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,980
 He's sitting with you at work.

300
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,900
 He's on the bench next to you at the gym.

301
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,960
 He's not working out.

302
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,220
 He doesn't need to, but he's there.

303
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,380
 Can you just imagine having that type of awareness?

304
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,260
 You know what I'm saying?

305
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,380
 I'm just telling you to wake up.

306
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,420
 Like it's amazing how little babies can sleep

307
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,060
 through the Aggies winning in Kyle Field.

308
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,820
 Like there's a hundred thousand people

309
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,980
 and you'll just see little infants sleeping.

310
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,340
 Can you imagine all that they're missing out on?

311
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,300
 And I just wonder if God's like, yeah, wake up.

312
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,840
 Like every day he's putting displays of his goodness

313
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,800
 and his greatness on in our lives.

314
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,300
 He's written a word and given it to us

315
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,960
 so that we can actually hear from God every single day.

316
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,760
 And I think he's just like, wake up because I'm here.

317
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,660
 So what does it look like to prioritize God's presence?

318
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,320
 Let me just encourage you, meet with him every day.

319
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,360
 Like meet with him every single day.

320
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,400
 Don't just meet with his word, meet with him.

321
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,900
 Here's what I mean by that.

322
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,560
 Like this book doesn't exist for completion.

323
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,920
 It exists for connection.

324
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,360
 So if you read it and close it

325
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,400
 and never answer the question,

326
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,600
 God, what are you saying to me?

327
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,840
 Then what a waste of time.

328
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,300
 And then don't leave him there.

329
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,440
 So many of us leave God at home

330
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,080
 like he's like some little puppy

331
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,160
 that when we walk out the door,

332
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 he just sits there in the window with his head tilted,

333
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,440
 like I'll see you when you get home.

334
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,500
 Like, no, I think the reason that Paul says,

335
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,920
 pray without ceasing is because when you close your Bible

336
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
 and say amen, God's like, all right, we better get to work.

337
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,580
 Let's go to the gym.

338
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,960
 Like he's just going with you.

339
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,400
 Whether you want him to or not, you can't ghost him.

340
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,040
 Like he is with you every moment of every day.

341
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,120
 Prioritize his presence.

342
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,520
 Number two, you want to move from good to godly,

343
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,880
 tremble at God's holiness.

344
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,760
 Tremble at God's holiness.

345
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,200
 Look back at this story.

346
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,400
 Look at verses three and four.

347
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,840
 Remember, this is a story about them moving the ark of God.

348
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,960
 And it says, "And they carried the ark of God

349
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,960
 "on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab,

350
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,880
 "which was on the hill.

351
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,920
 "And Uzziah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab,

352
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,100
 "were driving the new cart with the ark of God,

353
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,720
 "and Ahio went before the ark."

354
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 Now, when you hear that they had the ark on a cart

355
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,040
 and they were driving it, red flags should go up.

356
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,480
 And the reason why is because God had actually given

357
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,400
 very specific instructions on how to move the ark.

358
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,920
 See, the ark was a wooden box that had rings

359
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,640
 on all four corners, and God had told them

360
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,600
 to put poles through the rings,

361
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,760
 and it was to move on the shoulders of four men

362
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,880
 who were qualified to move it.

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,520
 But God also said, "You do not touch the ark

364
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,440
 "because it is holy."

365
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,720
 That was his command.

366
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
 He had actually commanded his people,

367
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,640
 "You don't touch the ark specifically because it's holy."

368
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,400
 And the text uses that word, it's holy.

369
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,280
 Now, watch what happens.

370
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,240
 Verse six, "And when they came to the threshing floor

371
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,460
 "of Nacon, Uzziah put out his hand to the ark of God

372
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,940
 "and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled,

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,560
 "and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzziah,

374
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,720
 "and God struck him down there because of his error,

375
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,800
 "and he died there beside the ark of God."

376
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,080
 And so they're moving the ark,

377
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,560
 and Uzziah sees the ark toppling over,

378
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,400
 and what does he do?

379
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,600
 He puts out a hand to catch it, and he dies.

380
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,640
 Now, real talk.

381
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,160
 When you hear that, that Uzziah puts out his hand

382
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 and tries to save it, and then God kills him,

383
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
 what's your automatic thought?

384
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,540
 Like, what do you think about that?

385
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,160
 How do you feel about that?

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,320
 It seems harsh, right?

387
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,680
 Like God's overreacting.

388
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,160
 Like they caught God on a bad day.

389
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,660
 He's like, "I knew they shouldn't move the ark.

390
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,500
 "You touched it, boom, you're done."

391
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,640
 But if you have the thought,

392
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,040
 God was too harsh,

393
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,120
 then that is a misinformed response,

394
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,280
 because the reality is not that God was too harsh.

395
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,540
 The reality is that Uzziah was too careless,

396
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:44,460
 because he was dealing with a holy God.

397
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,740
 See, if you wanna move from good to godly,

398
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,720
 you have to begin to get your heart and mind

399
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,200
 around the holiness of God.

400
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,960
 Don't miss what I'm telling you right now.

401
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,600
 All eyes on me.

402
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,760
 Your view of God will determine your response to God.

403
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,880
 Like how you know God to be

404
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,080
 will determine how you are with God.

405
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,280
 Your view of God will determine your response to God.

406
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,860
 So if you have a small view of God,

407
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,080
 that's why you have a small response to God.

408
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,060
 And those people who are just on fire for Jesus,

409
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,400
 I promise you, it's not just 'cause they're weird.

410
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
 It's because their views of Jesus are just so big

411
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,740
 that they don't know any other way to respond.

412
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,760
 God is a holy God.

413
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,340
 What does it mean that God is holy?

414
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,980
 Well, the Hebrew word for holy is the,

415
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,320
 it's the word kadosh.

416
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
 It means awesome or singled out.

417
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
 It can even mean cut off.

418
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,260
 So when we talk about God being holy,

419
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,960
 we're talking about God being singled out

420
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,960
 or so awesome or so cut off from everyone else

421
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,480
 in his greatness and in his beauty and majesty.

422
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,000
 All it means is that God is so other

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,480
 than anyone or anything else in this world.

424
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,240
 Like we can't begin to fathom who God is

425
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,600
 because he is holy.

426
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,960
 I'll explain it this way.

427
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 Like in case you ever wondered what the executive director

428
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,680
 of Breakaway Ministries drives,

429
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,640
 I drive a 2015 Hyundai Sonata.

430
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
 It's what I drive.

431
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,080
 It's a pretty sweet ride.

432
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,520
 I'm just gonna be real.

433
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,960
 I got like the top of the line Hyundai Sonata.

434
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,600
 Like I spent somewhere between 20 and $30,000 on it.

435
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 It's top of the line.

436
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,200
 It's got a panoramic sunroof, leather seats,

437
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
 even the like seat coolers.

438
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,160
 That's a big deal.

439
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,120
 So top of the line.

440
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,520
 So I want you to think about us on our best days.

441
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,200
 Like if you lived your best day today,

442
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,000
 let's just equate that to being a top of the line

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
 Hyundai Sonata.

444
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,240
 So if that's us, like us on our best days,

445
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,640
 if we're a Hyundai Sonata, then who's God?

446
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,700
 Well, we'd say, well, then God's a Mercedes S-Class

447
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,120
 starting at $100,000.

448
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,680
 Wrong.

449
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,600
 God's not a Mercedes S-Class.

450
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,600
 He's the Airbus 380 private jet designed by a Saudi prince

451
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,660
 that has a parking space for a Rolls Royce,

452
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,580
 a private concert hall, and a prayer room

453
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,940
 that automatically turns towards Mecca

454
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,420
 wherever it is in the sky.

455
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,140
 That's who God is.

456
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,040
 You know what the interesting thing is?

457
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,140
 That jet never made it to production.

458
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,940
 So you can't even get online and find images of it

459
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,620
 so that you can begin to get your mind around it.

460
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,620
 Your brain doesn't have a space for that type of aircraft.

461
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,500
 And it's the same with God.

462
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,800
 When we say that God is holy,

463
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,860
 that's what we're saying, that our mental capacity

464
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,060
 cannot even begin to scratch the surface

465
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,700
 of who God truly is.

466
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,480
 He is so other than we could ever know Him to be

467
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,940
 in His love and in His grace and in His mercy,

468
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,100
 but also in His justice and in His wrath.

469
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,300
 God is so other than we can ever comprehend.

470
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,420
 So when we talk about God being holy,

471
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,420
 it begins to make sense why a guy named Isaiah saw God.

472
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:22,460
 And when he just saw God, you know what he did?

473
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,100
 He's like, "Oh my gosh, I am lost and I am a filthy man."

474
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,260
 Is there anyone in your life that when you get around them,

475
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
 you're like, "Oh my gosh, I'm lost.

476
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,520
 "I'm a foul mouth and I'm a filthy human being."

477
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,340
 No.

478
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,780
 Or like a guy named Ezekiel.

479
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,300
 He saw God and when he saw God, he just hit the ground.

480
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,780
 Is there anyone in your life that like they walk in the door

481
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,900
 and you're just like, "Kh-kh-kh."

482
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,580
 Like you just collapse.

483
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,400
 You're like, "I'm sorry, I didn't do that on purpose.

484
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,940
 "That's just, that's what you do to me."

485
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,500
 Anyone like that in your life?

486
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,580
 Or in Revelation, John gets a vision of Jesus.

487
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,300
 And when he does, he just collapsed.

488
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 He's like, "I'm dead, I died."

489
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,900
 And the angel's like, "You're not dead, get up, man."

490
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 (audience laughing)

491
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,340
 That is the natural response to a God that is holy.

492
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,640
 So let's just be clear.

493
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,140
 If Jesus walked through that door tonight,

494
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
 nobody here would be sitting there like,

495
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,740
 "That's pretty good, I guess."

496
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,900
 (audience laughing)

497
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,180
 No.

498
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,700
 Like your body would instinctively hit the ground

499
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,580
 because your body has been made to worship a holy God.

500
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,100
 Do you know him as holy?

501
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,100
 Holy, holy.

502
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,100
 Several years ago when I was in probably

503
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,260
 fourth or fifth grade, I used to go each week with my dad.

504
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,260
 (audience laughing)

505
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,100
 What did I say?

506
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,260
 When I was in fourth or fifth grade,

507
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,740
 I used to go with my dad to,

508
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,580
 my dad would go to play racquetball with his close friend.

509
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,420
 And so I would tag along because my dad's racquetball buddy

510
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,180
 would bring his son, so we'd hang out together.

511
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,300
 And I'll never forget this one night

512
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,380
 where my dad had called the YMCA just down Preston Road

513
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
 and he had reserved a racquetball court.

514
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,340
 These two high school kids were playing on the court

515
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,380
 that my dad had reserved,

516
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,940
 and they just were playing right into my dad's time.

517
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,140
 So my dad politely knocked on the glass,

518
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,220
 just told him it was time, and the high school kid

519
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,700
 gave my dad the middle finger.

520
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,860
 And what that kid didn't realize is that my dad

521
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,100
 at the time was the chief psychologist

522
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,220
 of the Dallas County Juvenile Department,

523
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,580
 which was the place that troubled teens were taken

524
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,260
 when they didn't do right.

525
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,420
 And my dad's racquetball buddy

526
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,260
 was actually a Dallas County judge and an attorney.

527
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,940
 So when that high school kid stepped out,

528
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,900
 my dad very clearly and firmly informed him

529
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,100
 of who he had just flicked off.

530
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,060
 And in that moment, fear was put into that high school kid.

531
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,140
 And his buddy with him was like, "Dude, you can't do that."

532
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:21,300
 See, that kid did not realize that he was in the presence

533
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,580
 of one who commanded his respect.

534
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,220
 And I just tell you that to say, you know what,

535
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,380
 sometimes we are far too casual in the presence of God.

536
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,740
 Far too casual.

537
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,980
 Like we love talking about the fact that God is loving

538
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,140
 and kind and full of grace, and He is.

539
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,180
 But Jesus is more than just your buddy.

540
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,500
 Like He's the King of kings and Lord of lords.

541
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,140
 And so let me just encourage you

542
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,140
 to tremble at His holiness.

543
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,620
 There's times where I get up in the morning

544
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,340
 to meet with God, and I just kind of fly

545
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,420
 into my time with God, and I just start babbling in prayer.

546
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,820
 I'm just moving fast, and as I'm praying,

547
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,180
 I begin to say, I begin to pray, and I'm like,

548
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,380
 "And God, you are holy, holy."

549
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,020
 And as I'm working through three holies,

550
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,380
 by the time I get to the second one, I just slow down.

551
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,460
 Because I'm reminded of who I'm meeting with.

552
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,420
 And my posture moves from slouched back

553
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,620
 to leaning forward or bending a knee.

554
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,780
 Because God is worthy of our worship.

555
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:42,060
 He is worthy of everything because He is holy.

556
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,340
 So number one, prioritize His presence.

557
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,700
 Number two, tremble at God's holiness.

558
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,900
 Number three, treasure God's commands.

559
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,260
 Treasure God's commands.

560
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,300
 Listen to what David says in a different account

561
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,100
 of the same story.

562
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,580
 In 1 Chronicles chapter 15, verses 13 through 15,

563
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,820
 listen to what he says, it's very interesting.

564
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,740
 He's talking about the time that things

565
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,580
 went terribly wrong with the ark.

566
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,300
 He says, "Because you did not carry it the first time,

567
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,940
 "the Lord our God broke out against us."

568
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,780
 Why?

569
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,780
 "Because we did not seek Him according to the rule.

570
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,740
 "So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves

571
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,180
 "to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.

572
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,860
 "And the Levites carried the ark of God

573
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,740
 "on their shoulders with the poles,

574
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,540
 "as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord."

575
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,580
 Do you know what David's saying?

576
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,420
 He's saying we were too comfortable.

577
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,140
 Like God had spelled out exactly what we were to do,

578
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,460
 and we didn't do that.

579
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,380
 We were far too casual.

580
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,620
 The third key to moving from good to godly

581
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,580
 is simply to treasure God's commands.

582
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,100
 And I want you to see my wording there.

583
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,340
 I didn't say obey God's commands.

584
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,420
 I said treasure God's commands.

585
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,980
 'Cause some of you just need to hear

586
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,060
 that when we talk about obedience to God,

587
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,220
 obedience to God is actually for your joy.

588
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,940
 Like I love what Todd Wagner has said on this stage,

589
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,140
 and other people have said on this stage

590
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,500
 that God isn't trying to rip you off.

591
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,620
 He is trying to set you free.

592
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,980
 Would you believe that?

593
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,580
 A pastor named Charles Swindoll put it this way.

594
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,780
 He said, "If the Lord cared enough to write it

595
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,300
 "and cared enough to preserve it,

596
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,540
 "He cares enough about the details

597
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,460
 "to have you and me pull it off precisely His way."

598
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:42,780
 French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre said this.

599
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,780
 He says, "Man is the being whose project is to be God."

600
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,060
 Isn't that interesting?

601
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,380
 Man is the being whose project is to be God.

602
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,540
 Do you know what he's saying?

603
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,820
 He's saying we wanna call the shots.

604
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,500
 Like we wanna do things our way.

605
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,060
 That's our bent.

606
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,620
 That's your bent, that's my bent.

607
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,580
 Is to say, you know what God, I can do it better.

608
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,220
 Let me do it my way.

609
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,100
 But God has given us His word so that we will know His way

610
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,140
 so that we can carry out His will.

611
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,980
 You know what our tendency is?

612
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,260
 Our tendency is to say, God, I wanna do your will,

613
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,300
 but I wanna do it my way.

614
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,060
 God, I know you've given us your word

615
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,660
 so that we can know your ways to carry out your will.

616
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,620
 I do wanna carry out your will, but I wanna do it my way.

617
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,540
 So I remember a friend telling me, you know what?

618
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,740
 My girlfriend and I, we wanna honour God

619
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,940
 and we wanna honour God in our relationship,

620
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,300
 but we have just decided we're good

621
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,580
 with everything above the waist.

622
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,420
 And you might hear that and be like,

623
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,660
 hey, prudes, what's up?

624
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,820
 Like that might be, that's like just Friday night for you.

625
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,220
 I don't know what your thing is,

626
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,140
 but this isn't a dating talk right now.

627
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,380
 I just find it interesting, His wording.

628
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,620
 We have just decided.

629
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,580
 Isn't that interesting?

630
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,580
 We have just, it doesn't matter

631
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,540
 what God has spelled out for us.

632
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,300
 We wanna honour God, but we have just decided.

633
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,380
 You know what the interesting thing is?

634
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,980
 Is we want God's commands to submit to our feelings.

635
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,060
 So have you ever said something like this?

636
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,820
 Well, I just don't feel convicted about that.

637
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,700
 I just don't feel convicted

638
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,300
 about getting wasted on the weekends.

639
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,220
 Like I just don't feel convicted

640
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,540
 about hooking up with people.

641
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,500
 I just, I don't feel convicted

642
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,380
 about cutting corners at work.

643
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,540
 Here's the problem.

644
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:51,380
 Like God's commands don't bend to our feelings.

645
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,380
 Our feelings must submit to God's commands, period.

646
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,060
 Like if you don't feel convicted,

647
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,660
 that doesn't indicate a problem with God's commands.

648
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,380
 It indicates an issue with your heart.

649
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,540
 And so let me just encourage you.

650
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:15,740
 Treasure God's commands.

651
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,860
 Like obedience is actually one of the greatest displays

652
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,900
 of your love for God.

653
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,340
 Jesus puts it this way in John 14, 15.

654
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,300
 If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

655
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,220
 I want you to look back in the story.

656
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,620
 Let me just read you verses 12 through 15.

657
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,100
 Listen to what it says.

658
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,500
 It says, "And it was told King David,

659
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,260
 "the Lord has blessed the household of Obed-Edom

660
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,340
 "and all that belongs to him because of the ark of God.

661
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,980
 "So David went and brought up the ark of God

662
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,260
 "from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David

663
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,140
 "with rejoicing.

664
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,620
 "And when those who bore the ark of the Lord

665
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,860
 "had gone six steps,

666
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,740
 "he sacrificed an ox and a fattened animal.

667
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,340
 "And David danced before the Lord with all his might.

668
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,020
 "And David was wearing a linen ephod."

669
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,900
 So David and all the house of Israel

670
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,100
 brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting

671
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
 and with the sound of the horn.

672
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,900
 Do you know what we see there?

673
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,700
 We see obedience and joy colliding.

674
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,860
 That treasuring God's commands is for your joy.

675
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,020
 God isn't trying to rip you off.

676
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,420
 He's trying to set you free.

677
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,900
 A while back, I was talking with my 11-year-old Noah

678
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,980
 and he was telling me about a kid at school

679
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,020
 that was just being really mean to him.

680
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,780
 And it was just, it was stealing my son's joy.

681
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,620
 Like I could see bitterness taking root in his heart.

682
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,700
 And I don't know if you've had a bout with bitterness,

683
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,020
 but you know what bitterness is?

684
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,060
 Bitterness is a weed that if you let it grow inside of you,

685
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,380
 it will overtake anything healthy inside of you.

686
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,180
 And so what I told my son is I said,

687
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,940
 "Man, I just wanna encourage you

688
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,260
 "to go to that person at school and just say,

689
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,500
 "'Hey, is there anything that I've done

690
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,580
 "'to hurt you or offend you?

691
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,220
 "'Because if so, I wanna know about it

692
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,780
 "'so I can ask your forgiveness.

693
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,700
 "'But I see the way you treat me

694
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,740
 "'and something is wrong and I wanna deal with it.'"

695
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,780
 And as I was encouraging my son, Noah,

696
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,020
 I just saw fear in his eyes.

697
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,500
 Because as he listened to me,

698
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 I could see he didn't fully trust me.

699
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,620
 I could see that he was believing

700
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,300
 that what I was telling him was out to steal from him

701
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,420
 and rip him off instead of set him free.

702
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,820
 And I just wonder if so many of us read this word

703
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,620
 and we're like, "God, you are out to rip me off."

704
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,860
 And he's like, "No, I'm just trying to set you free."

705
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,460
 The final key to moving from good to godly

706
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,620
 is this, reject man's opposition.

707
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,860
 Reject man's opposition.

708
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,140
 I don't have time to read you the rest of the story.

709
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,860
 I'll just read you verse 16.

710
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,900
 Listen to what it says.

711
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,380
 It says, "As the ark of the Lord

712
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
 "came into the city of David,

713
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,540
 "Makal, the daughter of Saul," that is David's wife,

714
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,740
 "looked out of the window and saw King David

715
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,340
 "leaping and dancing before the Lord

716
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,340
 "and she despised him in her heart."

717
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,740
 So his own wife, David, is coming home

718
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,500
 and he is rejoicing.

719
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,540
 He's full of life and joy at moving the ark of God.

720
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,940
 And he comes home and his wife just lights him up.

721
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,700
 She's embarrassed by him.

722
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,420
 And you know what David says to her?

723
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,500
 He says, "I'll even become more undignified than that."

724
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,540
 And his point is, "I'm worshipping God.

725
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,660
 "I'm not seeking the approval of other people."

726
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,300
 The reason that I bring this up

727
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,060
 is everyone's great with you being good.

728
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,620
 Everyone is great with you being good.

729
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,700
 People have no problem with you striving

730
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,700
 to be a good guy or a good girl.

731
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,660
 But people aren't gonna be a fan of you being godly.

732
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,100
 Because you know what being godly does

733
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,900
 is it shines a light on the areas of their life

734
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,220
 where they're living in disobedience to the Lord.

735
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,420
 And people today do not wanna feel convicted.

736
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,540
 And so you know what they'll say?

737
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,300
 They'll say, "You're so legalistic."

738
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,740
 Let's just be clear on what legalism is.

739
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,860
 Legalism is believing that if you do all the right things

740
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,420
 you will earn the favor of God.

741
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,860
 Legalism is ratifying a certain set of traditions saying,

742
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,540
 "If you don't do these things,

743
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,500
 "you will not be in God's favor."

744
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,500
 But to pursue holiness for the sake of honoring God,

745
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,980
 knowing that you already have His approval,

746
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,140
 that's not legalism.

747
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,220
 That's just biblical Christianity.

748
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,180
 And so let me just encourage you,

749
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,060
 stay the course, reject man's opposition.

750
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,300
 What do we do with a talk like this?

751
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,700
 Well, let me just encourage you to do three things.

752
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,300
 Just three practical things.

753
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,540
 Number one, before you leave tonight,

754
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,460
 let me just encourage you, meet with God.

755
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,940
 Like if God is here, meet with Him.

756
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,780
 Like if we're singing a song, meet with Him.

757
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,620
 Don't come, go to all this effort to be here

758
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,220
 and leave without having met with God.

759
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,580
 And then when you get home tonight,

760
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,860
 let me just encourage you to share with a friend

761
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,740
 or if you guys go and grab something to eat after this,

762
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,380
 just sit and share with a friend

763
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,180
 what commands do you want to fully obey in your life

764
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,100
 in order to walk in freedom and display your love for God.

765
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,660
 And then let me just encourage you, every day this week,

766
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,980
 start every day on your knees telling God

767
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,900
 that He is holy, holy, holy.

768
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,180
 And then I'll end just by sharing this.

769
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,020
 If you're here tonight

770
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,860
 and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,

771
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,980
 you might be sitting there saying,

772
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,540
 you know what, I'm actually good with just being good.

773
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,500
 Like I'm good with being good.

774
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,100
 I just want to share with you the words of Jesus

775
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,740
 from Mark chapter 10, verse 18.

776
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,780
 Jesus said to someone, "Why do you call me good?

777
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,420
 No one is good except God alone."

778
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,340
 Isn't that interesting?

779
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,460
 No one is good except God alone.

780
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,780
 Do you know what that means?

781
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,740
 It means our definition of good

782
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,100
 is not God's definition of good.

783
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,180
 God's definition of good is perfection.

784
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,780
 Do you know what that means?

785
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,580
 Us being good without Jesus is not an option.

786
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,460
 Us just being good enough is not an option.

787
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,740
 And that's okay.

788
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,260
 Because the good news of Christianity

789
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,180
 is that when we could never be good enough,

790
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,780
 Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth

791
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,740
 to be good enough in our place.

792
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,940
 See, we talked about prioritizing the presence of God.

793
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,220
 Jesus was forsaken from the presence of God

794
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,340
 so that we could be brought into the presence of God.

795
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,100
 When Jesus hung on the cross, you know what he declared?

796
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,180
 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

797
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,700
 He was forsaken so that we could be accepted.

798
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,140
 We talked about trembling at God's holiness.

799
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,540
 Jesus Christ was and is holy.

800
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,300
 And yet he came so that us unholy people,

801
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,740
 through his death, burial, and resurrection,

802
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,740
 could be made right with a God who is holy, holy, holy.

803
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,180
 We talked about treasuring God's commands.

804
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,980
 Jesus fulfilled all of God's commands perfectly.

805
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,780
 He lived the life that you and I never could

806
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,740
 so that every single one of us

807
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,220
 who constantly fall short of God's standard

808
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,940
 can still have the love, acceptance, and approval of God,

809
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,220
 not because of what we will earn through performance,

810
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
 but because of receiving Jesus Christ

811
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,020
 in his perfect work for us on the cross.

812
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,740
 And then we talked about rejecting man's opposition.

813
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,940
 Jesus was spit at, laughed at, and mocked.

814
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,740
 And he endured man's opposition

815
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,740
 so that we could experience God's acceptance.

816
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,660
 This is Jesus.

817
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,420
 Do you know him?

818
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,060
 If not, the invitation to you tonight

819
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,700
 is simply to come and know him as your Lord and Savior.

820
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,740
 Let's pray together.

821
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:58,780
 Lord Jesus, I pray

822
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,940
 that you would do a work in our hearts tonight.

823
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,460
 God, I would imagine that there's people in this room

824
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,020
 who are like, "I'm not good and I'm not godly.

825
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,940
 "I'm far from both."

826
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,020
 And I just wonder if there's anyone in here

827
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,020
 who feels like that train has left the station,

828
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,700
 like there's no hope for them

829
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,260
 because of where they've been or what they've done.

830
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,740
 And I just thank you, Jesus,

831
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,620
 that what you did on the cross was sufficient for everyone,

832
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,100
 that anyone who would call upon the name of the Lord

833
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,340
 shall be saved,

834
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,900
 that complete forgiveness is on the table tonight,

835
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,860
 that instantaneously we can go from being enemies of God

836
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,100
 to being children of God,

837
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,820
 that we can go from being wicked in your sight

838
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,060
 to being godly in your sight, all because of Jesus Christ.

839
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,380
 Lord, I thank you that if we know you,

840
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
 you put your spirit in us,

841
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,060
 and your spirit is the one who goes to work in us,

842
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,780
 that obeying your commands isn't just something

843
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,740
 that we have to muscle up every day,

844
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,460
 but your spirit actually is the one

845
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,540
 who is at work in our lives.

846
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,620
 So I pray that my friends wouldn't leave here

847
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,580
 thinking that they just need to do a bunch more.

848
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,660
 I pray that they would realize that the key to godliness,

849
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,100
 it starts with surrender.

850
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,060
 It just starts with waking up every day,

851
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,940
 acknowledging your holiness,

852
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,300
 and surrendering to your leadership

853
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,140
 on a moment-by-moment basis.

854
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
 Lord, would you do a good work in our lives?

855
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,980
 We need you.

856
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,220
 We love you.

857
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,380
 In Jesus' name.

858
00:42:51,380 --> 00:43:01,380
