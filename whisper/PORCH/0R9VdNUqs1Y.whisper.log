[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.800]   - All right, hey, welcome everybody in the room,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.260]   everybody tuning in online, yeah, get excited.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.760]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.680]   Let's go, man, y'all are rowdy tonight.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220]   PortsLive, welcome all the PortsLive locations,
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.660]   in particular Scottsdale, Boise, Midland, North Houston,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.820]   Tulsa, wherever you are joining us from,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.620]   we're continuing this series of Ephesians.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340]   I'm gonna read the passage we're gonna be in,
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.180]   and it is a prayer that comes from chapter three
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.600]   of the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.540]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.980]   And I'm gonna start in verse 14,
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.580]   where Paul lays out one of the best prayers
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.900]   in the New Testament, and he says this,
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.740]   speaking to the Ephesian church.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.420]   "For this reason," talking about the gospel
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.980]   and how it is for all people everywhere,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.580]   "I kneel before the Father,
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.060]   "from whom every family in heaven and on earth
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.980]   "derives its name.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.260]   "I pray that out of the glorious riches,"
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.220]   out of his glorious riches,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.540]   "he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.560]   "in your inner being,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.760]   "so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   "And I pray that you,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.380]   "being rooted and established in love,
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.020]   "may have power together with all of the Lord's people,
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.540]   "to grasp how high and long
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.200]   "and high and deep is the love of Christ,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.760]   "and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.920]   "that you may be filled
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.480]   "to the measure of all fullness of God,
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.340]   "now to him who is able to do immeasurably more
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340]   "than all we could ask or imagine,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.800]   "according to his power that is at work within us,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.100]   "to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.860]   "throughout all generations, forever and ever.
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.980]   "And all God's people said, amen."
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.560]   Hey, in the room, anybody grow up playing soccer in here?
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.080]   I didn't grow up playing soccer, but you get it,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.800]   it's a ball, two goals, you figure it out.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640]   And I coach my kids and my son,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.600]   I coached his soccer team last year,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.480]   and it was a bunch of, at the time, five-year-olds,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240]   and how hard could it be?
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.260]   And so day one, show up, practice, teach 'em how to do it.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.560]   It's five-year-olds, they're just there
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   for the Capri Sun and orange slices anyways,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.420]   and try to teach 'em how to play soccer.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.500]   We go out for 11 consecutive weeks,
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.520]   the same thing happens over and over and over,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.040]   and that's called a loss.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.120]   A lot of teams have in history gone undefeated.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.040]   This was the first team I'd ever been a part of
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920]   that just simply went defeated.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.480]   And every week, we would show up and just get destroyed.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.760]   And so I knew soccer season was coming back,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.240]   coaching the team again, gonna hopefully
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.760]   have a better record than last year.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.600]   And so practice has been happening the last few weeks,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.400]   getting 'em ready, trying to teach 'em,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.800]   these are midfielders, and trying to teach 'em
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   something about the game, and to be aggressive,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.380]   and you're gonna take that ball down the field,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.360]   don't score on our goal, score on their goal,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.800]   and we're practicing.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   First game came this past Saturday.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.960]   Show up, game face is ready, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.880]   And about 32 minutes later, we had acquired another loss,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.000]   seven to zero.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.800]   And I'm just watching these kids, and I'm like,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   man, you guys are, clearly I have failed you as a coach.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.360]   I mean, this is a picture of us this Saturday
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.800]   out on the field, where I'm like,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.000]   all right guys, here's the deal.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.820]   I need you to stop losing, okay?
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.320]   Who wants to be a loser here, anybody?
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.360]   And that's not what I said at all.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.280]   But I'm trying to go through strategy,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.120]   I'm like, you're gonna take the ball,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.340]   I need you to be aggressive.
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.100]   You throw a little elbow, that's okay.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.880]   And I didn't say that, but man, I was so tempted to.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.480]   But these are kids that just were not able to succeed,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.760]   and candidly, they really didn't know how to.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.240]   How to not just survive in the game,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.560]   but really thrive, and even be any sort of competitive,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.480]   and the loss was seven to zero,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.240]   which is pretty significant among six year olds.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   Now, why do I start there?
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.500]   Because the Apostle Paul is going to, in this prayer,
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.160]   give us a formula, so to speak,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.520]   for how to succeed in your faith,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   or how to not just survive, but to thrive in your faith.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.280]   And apart from knowing that, and in life,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.640]   we're all gonna have valleys, and mountaintops,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.920]   or highs and lows, good times, hard times.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.560]   He's gonna give the formula that you and I are to go back to
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.640]   and he's praying over this Ephesian church
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   that no matter what they face,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.800]   this should be a part of their journey
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.160]   so that they could not just survive,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   but thrive and succeed in living out their faith.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.440]   And so we're gonna walk through,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.880]   but this is gonna give an answer to
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.360]   a lot of some of the questions
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.080]   that all of us have just in life,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.560]   of how do I go through life and be okay
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.600]   when things are not okay?
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.220]   He's gonna give some of the ingredients
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.660]   that make up people in the room right now,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.320]   that man, you're going through trying times,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.160]   but you just have like a peace about you,
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   and it's because of your awareness and your practice
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.840]   of the things that Paul is saying.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   And he's recording some words that I hope
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.760]   bury into your heart for the rest of your life,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.240]   because as things go well and things don't,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.480]   it is knowing and understanding these
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.880]   that will allow you to be okay in that journey,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.160]   and not just to survive, but to thrive in your faith.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.560]   As we've said, the book of Ephesians,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.240]   if you were joining us for the first week,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.320]   about three weeks ago, we were in the book,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.520]   or chapter two of Ephesians,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.000]   and if you missed it, all of that's available
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.120]   on the podcast or on YouTube
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.220]   or anywhere that you listen to stuff.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.960]   And basically, the book of Ephesians
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.840]   was a letter written to the church in Ephesus.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.240]   Whereas Ephesus, today, it's a modern day Turkey.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.740]   It was a coastal city, very influential city,
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.660]   very wealthy city, had a climate
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.840]   that made it something akin to LA.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.920]   It was incredibly just a fluent, nice place to live,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.760]   right on the coast.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.720]   You can go visit it and get on a plane today,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.000]   and there's still a large city that exists there.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.720]   And the apostle Paul, he loved the church in Ephesus.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.600]   He spent more time there than almost any other place
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.160]   that he would spend time.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.960]   And he's writing to this young church,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.480]   and he's saying, man, hey, I am hitting my knees,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.720]   praying for you, and here's what I'm praying.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.800]   And Paul writes this from a prison cell.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.860]   We know that it's about 60 AD, 30 years after Jesus,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.100]   and Paul's sitting in a prison cell,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.660]   and he's writing different letters to the churches,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.500]   and he writes and says,
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.880]   man, this is what I am praying for you.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.060]   And I'm gonna walk back slower, or more slowly,
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.540]   through verses 14 through 21,
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.980]   and he's coming out of the first part of chapter three,
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.860]   where he basically, in light of the gospel
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.700]   we covered in chapter two,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.380]   that Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead,
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.860]   and anyone who accepts him as the payment for their sin,
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.040]   their Lord and their Savior, can have eternal life.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.300]   And he, in the first part,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.460]   that we're not gonna read tonight,
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.840]   he basically saying, hey, it's not just Jews,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.220]   it's not just Gentiles, it's everybody.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.880]   And he's trying to correct, or he just corrected,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.160]   the flawed mentality a lot of people in that day had,
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.880]   that God is up in heaven going,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.300]   man, I just love the Jewish people,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.820]   and everybody else I'm pretty cool with,
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.320]   but man, at the end of the day,
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.300]   give me a J, give me an E, give me a W, go Jews,
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300]   that's the team that I'm on.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.560]   And Paul's saying, no, that's not, no, that's all off.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   That the message in the gospel is for all people everywhere,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.700]   that Jesus paved a way and created a bridge for all people.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.220]   And then he turns and he begins to pray.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.140]   And so let me read the first two verses again,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.100]   and I wanna highlight something that he says.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   For this reason, I kneel before the Father,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.980]   from whom every family in heaven and on earth
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.500]   derives its name.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.340]   He's just painting a picture
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.100]   of how great and grand and big God is.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.380]   Every person who's ever existed,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.100]   every family that's ever existed,
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.820]   comes from the source of life, which is God.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.820]   And I pray that out of his glorious riches,
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.220]   he may strengthen you with power through his spirit,
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.940]   that his Holy Spirit would give you power
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.860]   in your inner being,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.860]   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.740]   That the Apostle Paul
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.020]   is gonna pray some interesting things.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.900]   I mean, if you're Paul,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.340]   and you know all the challenges they're facing in Ephesus.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.580]   Ephesus is not an easy city to be a Christian.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.820]   These are young believers.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.860]   It's a very different day and age.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.540]   All the niceties of our modern world didn't exist.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.860]   And they're growing a church in a very hostile environment
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.200]   of all the things you could have prayed.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.000]   I'm praying God will strengthen you
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.780]   with his spirit on the inside,
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.780]   and that Christ will dwell in your heart through faith.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.060]   What does that mean?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.860]   Well, the first thing that Paul is pointing at
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.940]   is I'm praying that Christ would lead you,
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.980]   that you would let, or the first idea,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.300]   that you would be led by Christ.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.660]   Now, you probably have heard that before.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.060]   Here's why I say that, and here's why that matters.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.100]   He just used the expression,
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.440]   Christ would dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.020]   Now, if you're like me, and you grew up in church,
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.420]   you may have heard the expression before,
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.500]   hey, boys and girls,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.700]   who would like to accept Jesus into their heart?
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.140]   Anyone ever heard this before?
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.180]   Typically, it was painted like,
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.100]   would you like to go spend eternity in heaven
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.520]   with all the chocolate in the world,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.860]   and your parents, and your family,
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.980]   or would you like to go to hell forever, huh?
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.500]   It was a very simple decision as a kid.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.780]   You're like, I'm gonna go with the chocolate,
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.020]   even though I don't fully connect the dots
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.860]   on what this means.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.740]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.960]   No.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.460]   That phraseology is not even great phrasing.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.020]   I get the sentiment, but that's not a biblical idea
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.720]   in terms of being saved,
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.660]   of asking Jesus into your heart
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.720]   as though Jesus would appear from out of nowhere
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.980]   and just be shrunk down, honey,
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.660]   I shrunk the kid style, and go right into your heart.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.740]   That's not a biblical idea.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.300]   But this phrase that he's talking about
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.460]   is not about salvation.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.780]   He's saying, I'm asking that Christ would come
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.620]   make his home, and his spirit would set up shop
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.940]   in your heart through faith.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.480]   What is he saying?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.520]   He's praying, hey, that you would be led
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.420]   by Christ, here's why I mean that.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.860]   When you think about the heart,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.420]   and the Bible says, loving the Lord your God
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.860]   with all of your heart.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.540]   It says that you need to protect your heart
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.940]   'cause everything you do, the Proverbs say,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.060]   flows from your heart.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.700]   What is it saying?
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.360]   Well, you probably haven't thought about this,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.140]   but it's not saying your physical heart.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.180]   In other words, when you hear that,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.740]   you understand it's a metaphor.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.120]   The heart means something in the Bible.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   It is a word that is an attempt to describe
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.080]   the control center of your life.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.100]   That would be your emotions, your feelings,
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.380]   your decision making, your will, your personality,
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.700]   all of that would be your heart.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.500]   In other words, we understand when somebody says,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.620]   man, I'll give you my heart, they're not saying
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.180]   they wanna sign up to be a transplant donor to you.
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.660]   They're saying in dating context, man, I love you.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.180]   'Cause we understand it represents the control center
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.940]   of their life, their feelings.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.500]   And Paul is saying, hey, here's what I'm praying for you.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.740]   I'm praying that you would be led by Christ,
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.080]   and you would allow him to make his dwelling
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.080]   or to make a home inside of the control center of your life.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.480]   You would allow him to come in and inform how you date,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.060]   how you think, how you spend, how you work.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.180]   There would be no competition for, hey, God, you come in,
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.820]   you are leading my life.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.940]   I'm gonna trust you, you come make your home.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.980]   And the language he uses is to dwell or to make a home.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.700]   When I got married to my wife, we moved in together,
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.520]   which I would highly recommend when you get married.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.520]   And things very quickly began to change for me.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.780]   Here's what I mean.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.700]   I just mean like my environment, like where I existed,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.220]   dramatically changed overnight.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.620]   I was a single guy, I just didn't have a lot of stuff.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.460]   I slept on a futon every night.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.020]   All I owned was some books, clothes, and like,
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.020]   I don't even know that I owned anything else
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.600]   other than the futon, than that.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.000]   Then we got married, and all of a sudden, slowly over time,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.820]   as you had this relationship came in,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.860]   she began to redecorate everything.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.180]   And so the futon, it's gone.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.260]   Clothing stuff begins to appear on the walls.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.040]   Guys don't decorate and put things on the walls,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.060]   or at least I didn't.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.920]   And you know, pillows, they begin to bring in
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.340]   truckloads of pillows and rugs.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.980]   Rugs, we put rugs.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.000]   I don't know why you need rugs,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.060]   but they would just show up and they were everywhere.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.840]   And she began to, one by one, over time,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.420]   just begin to redecorate the home.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.340]   As she made it a home, she was going to bring
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.700]   some redecorating.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.740]   And Paul is saying, hey, I'm praying
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.460]   that you will trust Jesus.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.700]   That's what word by faith means.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.420]   And you would allow Jesus to come into your life
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.060]   and to redecorate your home.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.260]   And he's gonna show up and he's gonna begin to say,
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.740]   hey, I'm gonna begin to change some things in here.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.220]   And the old way you used to date,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.280]   and the old way you used to live,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.420]   and the old way you used to spend,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.500]   and the old way you used to talk,
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.220]   and the old way you used to think about forgiving people,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.060]   or relationships and hurts,
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.980]   I'm gonna begin to change and redecorate.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.600]   And Paul is saying, when that begins to happen,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.280]   I'm praying that you will trust him and follow him.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.480]   That you would be willing to be led by Jesus
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.720]   as it relates to all of your life.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.880]   I mean, candidly, this is why some of you guys,
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.820]   you've seen this begin to happen firsthand.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.240]   Like you trusted in Jesus,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.000]   and all of a sudden things began to change.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.480]   And it wasn't because somebody stood up here
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.720]   and gave you a 10 list, you know, do this, X,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.600]   do this, X, do this.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.260]   You just began to follow Jesus.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.060]   You began to live in community with other believers,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.100]   and he just began to change how you think
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.280]   about dating relationships.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.920]   How you think about the opposite sex.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.040]   How you think about your job.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.000]   How you think about life.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.180]   He began to like lead you to forgive
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.860]   that parents who really hurt you.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.600]   And it was because he began to come in
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.680]   and make his home in your heart and begin to change.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.000]   That you begin to go, man, I've never dated a guy actually,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.800]   like in kept physical boundaries,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.160]   but I began to actually follow Jesus.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.580]   And now I'm going, hey, I wanna prioritize pursuing purity.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.900]   Because Jesus has made his home
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.020]   in your control center of your life.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.220]   And you've trusted him.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.320]   And Paul's saying, man, I'm praying that you will continue
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.680]   to be led and trust him.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.500]   And that you would be strengthened from within
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.960]   to follow his lead.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.080]   That you would let him drive.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.340]   And then he gives a second prayer.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:48.000]   And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.480]   may have power together with all of the Lord's people
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.400]   to grasp how high, how wide, how long, how high,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.900]   and how deep is the love of Christ.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.820]   And to know this love that surpasses knowledge.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.480]   Paul is writing all of this.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.500]   He's hitting his knees on the floor of a prison cell.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.560]   Saying, man, I'm praying that you will allow Christ
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.400]   to lead your life.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.280]   And I'm praying that supernaturally God will allow you
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.320]   to know how deeply loved you are.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.440]   And that love would anchor you or root you
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.180]   or give you security.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.080]   When's the last time you heard anybody
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.700]   pray anything like that?
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.400]   I mean, if we're honest, just most of our prayers,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.800]   it's like, God, will you help me get the raise?
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.840]   Will you help me to get to work on time?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.860]   Will you help me to hit the green light?
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.400]   Will you help me to heal somebody that I know?
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.000]   And out of everything Paul could pray for,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.880]   he's saying, and I am begging God
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.720]   to help you be rooted in his love.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.440]   That you would have a foundation that is strong and secure
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.400]   because you understand how deeply loved you are by God.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.560]   The second idea from the text is that Paul prays
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.700]   that we would be secure in Christ's love.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.560]   That you would have security that comes
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.640]   from an awareness of God's love for you.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.240]   The picture of being rooted is a picture for plants,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.840]   that a tree, the deeper its roots go into the soil,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   the more stable and secure it is.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.280]   And Paul says, if you wanna have more stability,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.800]   more security, you wanna experience growth in your life,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.240]   it comes from you having roots that go deep
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.400]   into understanding God's love for you.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.480]   It doesn't come from understanding more Bible verses,
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.320]   which is a good thing.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.800]   Doesn't come from attending more church services,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.840]   which is a good thing.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.240]   Doesn't come from memorizing a certain number of passages.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.320]   He says, I'm praying, all those things are great.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.360]   But you would be rooted in an awareness
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.600]   of how deeply loved you are.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.280]   Here's why I think this is such an important thing,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.880]   and we can quickly dismiss and be like,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   yeah, he loves me, he loves the whole world.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.080]   But why it really matters,
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.880]   your perspective on God's love for you right now,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.720]   where you are, sitting here, listening online,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.760]   joining in another location,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.280]   is gonna determine when you inevitably fail God,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   and you do the thing you promised you would never do again,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.040]   you guys cross the physical boundary again,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.760]   you look at pornography again,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.840]   you end up drinking too much at the happy hour
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.120]   and you promised and you were done,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.560]   whenever that happens,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.720]   and whatever that looks like,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   your perspective on whether God and his perspective on you
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.600]   and his love for you has changed or not
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   is going to determine whether in those moments
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.360]   you're gonna run from God or you run towards him.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.520]   That without a death grip on man, I am loved.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.800]   I have a strong foundation,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.240]   and it doesn't come from my behavior,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.640]   it comes from an awareness that I am loved
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.960]   is what allows you to run towards God
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.400]   when those moments of failure happen.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.800]   There's actually a real life example of this in the Bible.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.160]   The apostle John was unique in a lot of respects,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.360]   and apostle John was one of the 12 disciples.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.360]   So Jesus on the planet has these 12 guys,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.720]   one of them named John, one of Jesus's best friends.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.840]   And Jesus on the night before he's crucified
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.920]   is betrayed by Peter,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.400]   and then he's abandoned by all 12 disciples.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.600]   Jesus even predicted,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.200]   "Hey guys, I'm gonna get arrested soon.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.720]   "All of you guys are gonna scatter.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.800]   "You're not even gonna act like you know me,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   "and you're all gonna abandon me in my worst moment."
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.000]   And all the disciples are listening,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.240]   and they're like, "No, not me, not me.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.520]   "I'll be willing to die for you."
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.000]   And just as Jesus said a few hours later, he's arrested.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.920]   He's led away to be crucified,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.200]   and all of them scatter, all of them run,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.280]   all of them abandon him.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.280]   And the next day, he's led out to be crucified.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   And we're told of only one disciple
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.280]   who shows up at the cross, John.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.440]   All the other ones had abandoned him,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.740]   and there's no mention or reference to them.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:25.440]   But John, despite having abandoned him 12 hours earlier,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.120]   feels as though he can still approach Jesus,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.000]   the guy that he had promised, "I'll never abandon you."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.640]   Why did he have that ability?
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.760]   Why would he be the only one
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.240]   that is referenced as showing up at the cross?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.720]   Well, he's not just unique
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   in that he's the only one mentioned.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.180]   He's unique in that he had a unique nickname
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.720]   that he had given himself.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.520]   And I think this nickname reflected a perspective
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.600]   that he had that allowed him, despite having failed,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   "I know that I can approach Jesus."
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.920]   And his nickname was this, five times in his own gospel,
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.680]   he refers to himself every time the same way.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.480]   "The disciple whom Jesus loved."
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.640]   Which is a funny way of putting it.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.060]   I mean, if you're the other disciples,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.360]   every time John refers to himself,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.880]   he's like, "Peter was there, Andrew,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.340]   "and the disciple whom Jesus loved."
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.600]   I mean, if you're the other guys, you're reading,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   you're like, "Take it easy, John, he loved all of us."
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.320]   But John's like, so caught up in his identity
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.600]   coming from God's and Jesus's love for him.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.880]   I mean, I want you to think about that.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.780]   In other words, his identity wasn't informed
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.040]   by how much he loved Jesus.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   It was informed by how much Jesus loved him.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.780]   And it is that that allowed him,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.560]   even after failing like all the other guys,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.040]   he distinctly comes to the cross
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.680]   and approaches despite having failed Jesus.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.720]   Because he saw himself as,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.880]   "My identity doesn't come from what I've done, what I do,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.240]   "or even how much I love Jesus.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.980]   "It comes from how much Jesus loves me."
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.180]   And it is having that grip that Paul is saying,
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.680]   "Man, I'm praying above everything I could pray,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.340]   "I pray that you would have an awareness
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.920]   "of how deeply loved you are."
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.820]   I know that in my own perspective,
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.520]   I probably have a flawed at best understanding
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.980]   because Paul says, "Man, this is going to give you stability
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.060]   "and continue to grow you and anchor you in your faith
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.800]   "so you know how loved you are."
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.300]   So many of the problems in our world,
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.420]   and candidly, in a lot of our lives,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   can be traced to seeking and desiring to feel,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.160]   or want to feel loved.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.700]   And Paul is saying, "I'm praying you wouldn't seek that
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.300]   "other places, you would know how loved you are."
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.260]   Why do I say problems?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.900]   I was reading this past week a book by Patrick Carnes,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.340]   who's one of the leading psychologists of today,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.660]   particularly in the realm of addiction.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.300]   And he's not a believer, but he writes,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.900]   and he's an award-winning psychologist
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.220]   on behavioral patterns and addiction.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.080]   And he wrote something in one of his books
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.560]   called Out of the Shadows about his conclusion
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.600]   about what fuels a lot of addiction.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.080]   And it was a pretty fascinating thing.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   He said, "At the heart of addict behavior,
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.480]   "it's fueled by believing they are unlovable
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.400]   "and/or unloved."
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.180]   So many of the issues that people wrestle with
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.340]   can be traced to this emptiness, this feeling like,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.060]   man, I don't know that I am worth loving.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.980]   And Paul's saying, "I pray that you would have a flood
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.280]   "of understanding of how loved that you are."
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:44.860]   Kesha did an interview with The Rolling Stone,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.620]   feels like a curveball, but,
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.300]   in it, she said something that was interesting.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.880]   For a girl who has everything, she has beauty,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   she has fame, she has money, she has success,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.500]   she's brilliant, and in it, she said,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.980]   "I'm a crusader for being yourself and loving yourself,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.260]   "but I found it very hard to practice.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.280]   "I'll be unavailable for the next season
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.740]   "seeking treatment for an eating disorder."
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:19.600]   But she's going, "I am finding it difficult
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.340]   "to find myself worth loving."
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.740]   And the challenge of her saying,
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.220]   "Man, I can't love myself,"
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   is ultimately, if your focus is self-love,
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.980]   the focus of your love is self.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.120]   And Paul says, "Man, I'm praying that you'll have
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.820]   "a death grip on the fact that you,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.340]   "no matter what you do for the rest of your life,
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.860]   "no matter how many times you fail,
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.240]   "you are loved by God, and that will anchor you,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.660]   "because it's gonna shape you, and it's gonna shape me."
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.620]   And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that you
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.380]   "would be secure in Christ's love."
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.140]   So many of the dating relationships in the room,
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.740]   candidly, are driven by the fact
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.820]   that you don't think that you're worthy or valuable,
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.580]   or you think of yourself as damaged goods,
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.980]   so you lower your standards,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.860]   or you think that no one will ever wanna date
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.300]   somebody like you, so you turn to pornography.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.740]   One of the top reasons people turn to pornography
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.500]   is a desire to feel desired.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.200]   And Paul, it makes sense when you begin to see
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.020]   all the different ways it plays out inside of our life.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.420]   I mean, how much just the fear of how we look
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.300]   makes us, or wanting to be loved
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.700]   makes us stress certain ways,
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.220]   and something tighter, and something that goes lower,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.900]   or comes up higher.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.700]   It's no wonder plastic surgery is at an all-time high.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.540]   People chasing the desire to feel accepted,
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.480]   to feel loved, to feel affirmed.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.800]   And Paul says, "Man, there's a love that I'm begging God
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.380]   "to give you supernatural ability to see."
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.260]   And he says, "It's four-dimensional.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.400]   "It's wide enough for all of mankind.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.860]   "It is a love that is greater
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.580]   "than anything you would understand.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.720]   "It is deeper, and deep enough to reach
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.520]   "into the darkest sinner's heart.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.160]   "It is long enough to scale, and will scale eternity.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.880]   "It is high enough to bring all things
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.120]   "into the heavenly places,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.460]   "and I'm praying for you to know it."
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.260]   And he says something so interesting.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.260]   He says, "I'm praying you will know the love of God
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.920]   "that surpasses knowledge.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.820]   "I'm praying this love that is so grand, so high,
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.500]   "so large, so wide, so incredible, four dimensions,
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.860]   "I'm praying and asking God for you to know it,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.600]   "because it surpasses knowledge,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.840]   "for you to experience it."
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.680]   He gives four dimensions.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.560]   If you've heard of 4D movies before,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.080]   there's something, for those of us, or if you haven't,
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.180]   I went to a 4D movie about a year ago
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.920]   with one of my kids at this movie theater,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.280]   and in the movie theater, what makes it 4D,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.920]   if you haven't been to one, is it takes 3D,
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.400]   we have the glasses, and then it adds physical elements
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.220]   so you have another dimension and you experience it.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.360]   In other words, when I was at,
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.040]   put on the glasses, watching some Lego movie,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.520]   and all of a sudden, you're seeing everything in 3D,
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.880]   but then snow, fake snow begins to fall,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.120]   and fake wind begins to blow, and fake rain begins to fall.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.480]   The difference between the 3D and the 4D is you feel it,
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.840]   you experience it, and Paul's saying,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.200]   "Man, I'm praying that God would allow you
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.060]   "a 4D understanding of his love,
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   "that you would experience it,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.780]   "that it would begin to rush into your life."
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.640]   'Cause here's what I just know, at least for me,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.940]   and I think for a lot of Christians,
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.180]   when we think of the love of God,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.660]   we're like, "Man, that's so sweet, and that's great,
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.900]   "and yeah, that's awesome, and you know,
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.560]   "he's a loving God, and it's great."
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.400]   And Paul is saying, "This is the thing
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.040]   "that changes everything.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.200]   "It's immeasurable, other than when you look at the cross.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.100]   "It's the only measuring unit that we have,
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.200]   "depicts God's love of giving his own son on the cross
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.460]   "for you and me, that there's no length I could go
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.000]   "that would be greater."
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.180]   And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that it would
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.920]   "have a death grip in your life."
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.140]   Here's what I mean when we kinda underplay.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.160]   It's almost like we think of God's love,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.200]   and it's like we think of the difference
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.500]   between sprinkling outside and a hurricane.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.920]   When the Bible describes his love,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.780]   it's like it is like nothing,
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.780]   it's like a hurricane flood of rushing waters.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.480]   And I think a lot of times we think of it as like,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.280]   it's kinda raining, like we go outside,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.980]   and it's like, "Oh, it's kinda sprinkling.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.080]   "There's a little sprinkle over here,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.000]   "and there's some little rain over here."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.820]   And Paul is saying, "It's like a hurricane of (blows)
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.740]   "and I'm praying that it would fall on you,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.380]   "and you would understand it,
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.000]   "and that would impact the rest of your life."
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.160]   And then, after moving into being secure in his love,
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.860]   he says, "That you may be filled
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:57.380]   "to the measure of all the fullness of God."
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.560]   He uses plan words in the Greek,
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.400]   which was the original language, and he's saying,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.500]   "I'm praying that you would be full
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.740]   "and experience some of the fullness of God."
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.580]   And this prayer includes,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.280]   "Hey, I'm praying you'd be led by Christ,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.780]   "you would be secure in the love of Christ,
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.680]   "and that you would find satisfaction,"
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.100]   or point three, "be satisfied in Christ."
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.780]   The same word in Greek for satisfied is filled.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.880]   He says, "I'm praying you'd be filled.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.140]   "I'm praying you'd be satisfied.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.180]   "I'm praying that you would not look to other things
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.260]   "that cannot fulfill what only Christ can,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.740]   "that you wouldn't look to a job,
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.940]   "you wouldn't look to a paycheck,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.360]   "you wouldn't look to some future day
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.020]   "where you're married and everything's pretty
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.340]   "and you've got all the different dreams
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   "and hopes that you have, and believe the lie
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.660]   "that, hey, once I'm there, then I'll be satisfied,
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.900]   "that you would know there is only one source."
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.500]   And the reason this is important is if you operate
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.260]   and seek to be satisfied or seek and look
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.500]   to other things around you in the world,
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.780]   they're going to leave you empty.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.100]   And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that you would be filled
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.700]   "and know where you can experience being filled
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.200]   "at a soul level."
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.200]   Whenever I go shopping, which is not often,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.920]   but I've done it before, and especially grocery shopping,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.800]   I can't go grocery shopping if I'm hungry
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.160]   because what happens?
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.000]   We've all been there before.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.640]   You end up being like, "Oh, look, Tostitos has another new,
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.300]   "I've never even seen this flavor before.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.700]   "It's on sale, and let's get it."
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.720]   And you end up buying all these different things
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.320]   that you don't need and you're eating in the car
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.080]   on the way home just 'cause you haven't eaten.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.560]   And I think Paul is saying, "Man, I'm hoping you don't go
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.140]   "through life making decisions,
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:46.660]   "living from a place where because of an emptiness
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.640]   "inside of you, you seek to fill it
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.100]   "with things that can never provide lasting satisfaction,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.020]   "that you would be satisfied and you would experience that
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.420]   "at the only place where it is available,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.160]   "which is in Christ."
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.960]   What's interesting in today's age is we look at Hollywood,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.820]   and you look at all the successful music artists,
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.500]   you look at people that have everything that everybody wants.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.980]   And in particular in the music industry,
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.100]   it's a really fascinating one because we have a firsthand
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.600]   look into some of the music they write
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.100]   and some of the lyrics that they put out,
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.700]   and these are men and women who have everything.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.500]   I mean, they have a house, they have the cars,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.880]   they have the lifestyle the world wants,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.260]   and yet they write lyrics every now and then
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.180]   that just sleep out or just pop out there,
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.900]   and they're not the off the wall to the window,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.340]   but they actually have meaning.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.680]   And you go, "Wow, you're really lonely."
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.380]   What are some examples of what I mean by that?
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.700]   People that despite having everything the world says
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.240]   would satisfy go, "I feel empty."
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.500]   Olivia Rodrigo has a song called Jealousy Jealousy.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.840]   Just listen to these lyrics.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.380]   And this is someone who by the world standards
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.880]   is famous, beautiful, popular,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.600]   and she writes, "I want to be you so bad
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.680]   "and I don't even know you.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.520]   "All I see is what I should be, happier, prettier.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.680]   "I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be anyone, anyone else."
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.980]   Juice WRLD, who sadly passed away
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.300]   because of his battle with depression
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.780]   and battle with being unable to feel something
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.280]   that only Christ can, in one of his songs, Wishing Well,
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.720]   "Ring, ring, phone call from depression.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.380]   "On the other line, I talk to addiction.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.700]   "Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.860]   "Something feels broke on the inside, need to fix it."
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.740]   I mean, even Stressed Out, which is like one of the
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.280]   more popular songs of the last couple years by 21 Pilots.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.580]   Listen, I mean, and they all got tunes,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.180]   and so until you stop and you're like,
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.840]   "Wow, you are really lonely, you need Jesus."
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.580]   You're just kind of nodding your head along,
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.540]   listening to it on the radio,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.660]   but listen to part of the lyrics in there.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.820]   "I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:19.880]   "But now I am, I'm insecure, I care what people think.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.840]   "Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.000]   "when mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.200]   Even Bieber, describing all the wild success he had,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.620]   "What if you had it all, but no one to call?
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.180]   "Maybe then you'd know me, 'cause I've had everything,
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.020]   "but no one's listening, and that's just so lonely.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.020]   "I'm so lonely, lonely."
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.200]   Now, this have great beats,
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.600]   and a lot of us are very familiar with them.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.100]   But when you stop and you go,
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.300]   their description of a life
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.680]   that has everything the world says matters,
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.260]   they're describing.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.660]   The world has sold a lie,
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.600]   and none of this stuff satisfies,
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.100]   because it doesn't, and there's only one place
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.960]   that you and I can find satisfaction,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   that there's no relationship, there's no salary.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.160]   Whatever you make right now, if you doubled it,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.600]   it wouldn't be enough.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.940]   Whatever your relational status is,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.080]   if you had fill in the blank of what you wanted,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.840]   it would still not be enough apart from Christ.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.120]   And Paul's saying, "I'm praying you would know
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.880]   "how loved you are, you would have a security.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.080]   "You're not gonna look at the world
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.560]   "and try to fix it by everybody else,
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.460]   "or try to fix it by the next thing,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.300]   "or the next relationship, or the next job,
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.380]   "or the next purchase.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.520]   "I'm gonna find it in the only place I can,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.780]   "which for the rest of your life
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.720]   "is in a relationship with Jesus."
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.800]   And Paul says, "Man, I'm praying that you would be filled
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.120]   "by the fullness of God.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.760]   "The fullness of God is more than enough
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.160]   "to fill every single human soul and human heart
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.040]   "that's ever existed."
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.320]   And he's saying, "You would experience the fullness
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.640]   "that is far more than enough."
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.800]   It's like this, this is an empty water bottle.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.840]   He's saying, "I'm praying that you would know
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.440]   "that there is far more than enough,
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.520]   "and you would go deep into knowing the character
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.100]   "and the love of God, and you would experience
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.880]   "that it is more than enough,
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.420]   "that you would be surrounded by his love,
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.900]   "you would be filled by his love,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.120]   "and you would experience a fullness that comes
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.380]   "only from knowing Christ."
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.180]   You can golf clap or not, I don't care.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.640]   (audience laughs)
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.340]   And I'm gonna transition here, but listen to me very clearly.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.800]   I know I can talk up here like this for 30 minutes,
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.120]   I can show you an illustration, I can do all of that,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.700]   and sadly, a lot of you don't believe me.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.380]   And you can hear it, and you're taking notes,
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.580]   and you may be even saying, "Golf clap," and that's good,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.660]   but you live a life that reflects the fact
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.420]   that you actually think if he would just call you back,
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.300]   you'd be okay.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.740]   You actually think if you would have just gotten
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.500]   into that certain school, then, oh man,
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.420]   life would have been so much better, and what if?
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.360]   And you have bought a lie,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.000]   'cause that's the way it can play at us.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.780]   Like, we can buy into this mentality that,
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.860]   "Oh man, if only I had,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.460]   "then I would have been so much more satisfied."
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.400]   Or, if only someday, and Paul is saying,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.580]   "I'm praying you would live from a fullness that comes,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.400]   "and there's only one place where it comes,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.680]   "and I'm praying God will give you the supernatural strength."
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.120]   That's why he starts on the inside.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.320]   That's why he starts saying, "I'm praying God
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.760]   "will give you power, the power that raised Christ
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.440]   "from the dead now indwells you.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.960]   "You have the spirit of God, and I'm praying
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.900]   "he will allow you to know his love that would secure you,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.740]   "and you would experience soul satisfaction,
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.280]   "and for the rest of your life, for the rest of my life,
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.080]   "if you wanna experience satisfaction,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.740]   "it's not gonna come through any
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.260]   "of the different things that I've listed out.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.860]   "There is only one place,
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.840]   "and if you just forget everything I'm saying,
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.600]   "and in six years from now, you walk out of the church today
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.520]   "and you don't come back for another decade,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.980]   "and you come back, the message will be the same.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.500]   "There is only one place and one person
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.120]   "that can give you satisfaction, and it's Jesus."
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.560]   And so, of course, Paul's going, "Man,
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.180]   "I get on my knees, Ephesian Church.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.320]   "Yeah, I know everything you're facing,
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.720]   "all the persecution you're facing.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.580]   "I'm sitting in a prison cell, and I am praying.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.420]   "I'm praying out prayers.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.360]   "You've never heard anybody pray like this.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.400]   "I'm praying God will let you be anchored in his love.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.940]   "Really, Paul, you just pray for me to get a raise?
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.760]   "I've been making $20 an hour for the last four years."
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.280]   And Paul's going, "The thing you need more
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.440]   "than any of the things that you think that you need
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.380]   "is a deeper understanding of God's tsunami of love for you,
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.080]   "displayed perfectly on the cross,
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.440]   "to be led by his Spirit, and Jesus, to come in,
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.680]   "and when he begins to redecorate, you trust him,
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.560]   "and you say, 'God, I'm doing it your way.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.820]   "'We're not keeping my furniture.'
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.160]   "You move in, you take over, you take the wheel,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   "and for you to look to the only one that can satisfy,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.400]   "which is him."
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.820]   It's a pretty powerful prayer.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.800]   And I wanna transition, and I wanna bring up
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.720]   a brother in Christ who has embodied for years,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.780]   and is embodying even right now what it looks like
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   to say, "Jesus, I want you above anything else.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.500]   "I want more of you, and I wanna treasure more of you.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.860]   "And so any way that I can do that, I wanna do."
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.040]   And so will you help welcome JD up here?
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   (audience applauds)
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:38.460]   - All right, what's up, everyone?
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.100]   If we haven't met, my name is JD,
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.560]   and I have worked here at The Porch for the last,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.160]   going on a little over three years.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.840]   And if you've been around here, you might have noticed
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.540]   that through Awakened and different things,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.420]   I have been absent for the last about six or seven weeks.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.960]   If you haven't noticed, this is your first time here,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.760]   and you're going, "I have no idea who this guy is.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.480]   "Welcome to kind of like an awkward family meeting."
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.180]   But if you know, you know.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.020]   Man.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.200]   I knew that word tonight.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.940]   I knew that reminder.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:17.340]   I wanna let you guys in on just some stuff
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.680]   going on in my life.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.940]   When I moved here three years ago,
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.600]   I moved from College Station, Texas,
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.760]   and had no idea what God had in store.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.180]   I came here to do the Watermark Institute
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.480]   to be a student of his word.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.560]   I was on the production team here at The Porch.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.480]   And next thing I know, in a matter of months,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.320]   I became a teacher of God's word for the first time.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.340]   And throughout the three years of teaching here,
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.180]   which has been such a joy, I don't know when it began.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.000]   I don't know how exactly it began.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.520]   But I have found myself, just like you guys,
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.460]   I've said that from day one, I'm no different than you,
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.620]   but I have found myself at 29, 28, 27,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.080]   sitting way too much in the seat of being a minister
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.800]   and not being ministered to.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.620]   I found myself in the seat of being asked questions
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.360]   by people and being looked to to have answers
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:23.400]   and not sitting in the seat of asking more questions.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.280]   I found myself somewhere along the way
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.180]   getting caught up in believing the lie
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.340]   that because I'm doing right things,
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.460]   that means that I am operating in right living.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.420]   And somewhere along the way, as you'll hear,
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.200]   I've woken up to the reality that
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.140]   my life has gone from doing right things
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.220]   and I've missed the real thing in a relationship with Jesus.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.720]   And where that came to be is I found myself
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.440]   as it kind of seemed like I was operating in this mentality
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.560]   of needing to have the answers, being looked to as a leader
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.480]   and thinking that, man, I need to carry
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.440]   these burdens and this weight
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.180]   just somewhere deep in my subconscious.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.220]   I found myself running at times to safe people,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.140]   my people, safe places,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.980]   and what that actually ended up looking like
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.620]   at the beginning of August is my birthday.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.340]   And me and some friends, some dear friends,
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.360]   some close friends and some family
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.700]   went on a beach trip to celebrate.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.540]   And during that week, not only is it my birthday,
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.700]   but it's also my dad, my best friend's death anniversary.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.460]   And it had been seven years,
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.340]   and that night I found myself upset.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.400]   I found myself anxious.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.240]   I found myself frustrated with God.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:54.320]   And honestly, I found myself just wanting to be human,
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.160]   to be mad.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.800]   And so in that mindset of wanting to run to a safe place,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.680]   wanting to be off for a night,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.700]   I chose to make compromising decisions around alcohol.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.420]   And just frankly, I drank too much.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.760]   And being in a public place,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.500]   drinking too much as a pastor,
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.760]   it's not becoming of a leader that you deserve.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.840]   And I put my wife, I put my friends in a position
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.140]   that they should never have to be in as a leader.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.720]   I was not operating as a leader.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.680]   And I take full responsibility for my actions.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.460]   And I just want to say it was sin.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.140]   I sinned before God, my people,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.060]   and I sinned against you, and I'm sorry.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.680]   After getting back from the trip,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.940]   I immediately confessed to people around me,
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.900]   and then I confessed to leaders here at Watermark,
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.980]   all that took place, and they have responded with care,
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.800]   with correction, and with grace.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.700]   And they have walked with me so well
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.780]   in this really just revealing season.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.640]   Before what I'm about to say,
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   what I don't want this to seem like
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.140]   is the young guy made a mistake one night,
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.360]   and now he's having to get up here and do this
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.240]   because what I've had to come personally to realize
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.160]   is that you don't just get to a place
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   of making a mistake like this
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.320]   as a pastor and as a leader overnight.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.760]   That this outward expression of all the inward reality
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.340]   and feeling, it was a drift.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.500]   It was something in my heart that took place over time.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.420]   And so I have spent the last six weeks,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.440]   I'm gonna continue to spend as long as it takes,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.000]   just like it was a drift to run away from God
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.400]   in the midst of all of the things I was feeling,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.440]   it's gonna be a drift to run back to God.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.340]   It's gonna take time, it's gonna take a season
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.560]   to get back to the place that I wanna be,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.200]   the place of health that I wanna be with God,
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.020]   because what you guys deserve is a person up here
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.600]   that you can trust.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.660]   That if I'm gonna call you to believe
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.680]   that God is enough, that in Him is the fullness
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.360]   of satisfaction, that when you're anxious,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.280]   when you're sad, when you're lonely,
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.600]   if I'm gonna call you to run to Him
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.900]   and not to the things of the world,
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.480]   I have to practice that myself.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:40.780]   And I am frustrated, sometimes I'm embarrassed.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.120]   The enemy has tried to condemn me,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.760]   but I do believe that there is therefore now no condemnation
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.860]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:57.360]   And I want you to know that God in this six weeks
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.720]   has already redeemed so much, and He has revealed so much,
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.400]   and I am so thankful.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:09.280]   This is only God, only God can take these moments
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.880]   and bring beauty from ashes, and He's doing it.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.200]   And I am falling deeply in love with Jesus again.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.700]   And when I started doing this, thank you.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.180]   When I started doing this, I always said,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.720]   "Man, I just wanna make sure that things stay
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.660]   "in the right order.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.340]   "I don't want anything to be outwardly
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.200]   "if it's not real inwardly."
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.960]   And I was blind for a season, and this woke me up.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.240]   And I don't wanna be blind.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.080]   The reality is, is a lot of people in these positions,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.560]   guys, pray for leaders in these positions.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.480]   It is hard.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.800]   But the reality is, a lot of people end up
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.320]   in a really, really, really bad place
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.400]   because in these moments, in these warning signs,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.540]   they didn't run to God.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.560]   They kept running, they kept hiding, they kept managing.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.580]   And it's just not worth it.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.920]   And so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna keep doing
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.520]   what I've been doing.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.200]   I made the decision to transition off staff for a season.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.360]   Because I believe that our God is a restoring God,
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.000]   I believe that I will be back fully restored
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.600]   to ministry one day.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.480]   I do believe that.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.640]   However, I am gonna take a season away
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.480]   because I wanna really make sure,
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.440]   I wanna make sure that God has healed
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.360]   every part of my heart.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.560]   I wanna grieve my dad, honestly.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.240]   I wanna really grieve it.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.840]   I wanna focus on my marriage, on my community.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.640]   I wanna be invested in church.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.280]   And I just wanna be restored.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.200]   And so, I wanna ask you guys for forgiveness.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.880]   I love you guys.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.960]   I'm gonna be sad, I'm gonna miss this place a lot.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.640]   You guys are like a family to me.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.320]   But please be praying.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.440]   Please be praying as we enter into this next season.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.320]   As I continue to heal and continue to walk with Jesus
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.200]   and people, just be praying for me and for my family,
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.520]   for the people around me.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.680]   It was fitting, every year I asked God, every birthday,
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.240]   so that trip, I asked God, what is the word for the year?
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.760]   And he said, more.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:33.680]   And I didn't know what that meant at the time.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.160]   And it's just so funny that tonight, I'm here,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.000]   the passage, the end of the passage,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.600]   the end of the prayer, what does he say?
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.600]   He says, now to him who is able to do immeasurably more,
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.040]   then all we can ask or imagine, according to his power
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.640]   that is at work within us, to him,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.120]   be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.120]   throughout all generation forever and ever, amen.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.200]   And I'm hopeful.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.280]   I believe that God is about to do immeasurably more
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.400]   for this ministry and my life and I hope in your life.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.760]   And I just wanna say as I wrap up,
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.960]   and these guys come up here to pray over me,
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.800]   do not wait like I did.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:24.440]   God was granting me little signs along the way.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.220]   Hey, are you sure you're fully healed from that?
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.760]   Are you sure you're fully well from that?
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.080]   Are you sure you're being honest
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.000]   about the burdens you're carrying?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.640]   And I chose to keep going and keep going
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.040]   until it all came up.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.960]   And so I would just ask you tonight, whatever it is,
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.760]   let this be your warning sign.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.720]   We're no different.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.040]   We're called.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.760]   We are all called if you are in Christ.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.360]   Let this be your warning sign.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.120]   Talk to somebody.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.680]   Bring it to the light.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.440]   Be free.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.800]   And my prayer is that tonight would be a night
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.400]   that God does immeasurably more.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.240]   Thank you.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.740]   (congregation applauding)
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.040]   - We love JD.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.080]   He's got people around him.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.840]   He decided to share here,
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.760]   which is a reflection of his character.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.900]   This wasn't a come up.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.840]   This was a, hey, I love these people.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.560]   And we believe, and I've said since I met JD,
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.860]   I love him and believe in him and wanna pray
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.680]   and ask that he would do more.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.440]   And Father, I thank you for JD.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.040]   I thank you for the life,
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.760]   the man that he is.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.120]   I thank you for the courage he has consistently had.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.720]   I thank you for the openness.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.980]   And we ask that you would do immeasurably more
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.800]   than all we could ever ask, think, or imagine.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.560]   We thank you that you are not done with any of us
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.000]   and none of us deserve anything.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.720]   And yet you allow us to be a part of that.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.540]   I thank you for him.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   I thank you for just the ways he is following you
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:16.240]   and setting an example for all those in this room.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.920]   And so I pray that he would leave tonight
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.820]   and I pray that you would allow your spirit
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.600]   to strengthen his inner being
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:31.080]   and you would allow him to know how deeply loved he is.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.000]   And that has never changed, that will never change.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.280]   And you would do through his life,
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.060]   through this season and through the future,
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.040]   through his surrender and faithfulness to you
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.760]   more than we could ever ask, think, or imagine,
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.200]   would you do more for your glory
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.800]   in this generation and every generation.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.660]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:59.640]   (congregation applauding)
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.880]   (gentle music)
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.320]   We love JD and I'm so proud of him.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.680]   And like I said, that he made that decision
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:17.360]   and he made that decision because he knows who loves him,
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.060]   his security, where it comes from,
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.820]   and wants Jesus above anything else.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.720]   And all of us in life have seasons where we need to say,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.640]   man, I need to step back.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.920]   God, I want Jesus more than anything else.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.020]   And I think some,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.860]   one or someones,
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.960]   maybe God has you here.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:45.680]   So you could see that step of faithfulness.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.320]   I'm just saying, God,
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.080]   I don't want anything that's gonna get in the way of you.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.280]   And I can respond to your love
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.280]   and I can bring out and confess,
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.240]   walk in the light and do that
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.920]   'cause I'm securing that love.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.280]   And so I wanna pray for us
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.720]   and I wanna pray for all of us in the room
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.000]   to be more and more of
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.800]   God's men and God's women.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.660]   And I'm gonna do so by doing what Paul did
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.500]   here in just a second.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.260]   I'm gonna hit knees and just pray that God
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.660]   would allow all of us to have an experience
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.260]   of the things that Paul asked for.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.420]   But if you're in that season,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.580]   man, God is whispering to you,
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.660]   I love you and I want you to experience
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.920]   more of my love by stepping towards freedom.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.540]   Let me pray.
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:55.220]   Father, I pray for every believer
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.800]   (gentle music)
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.020]   who has the spirit of God
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:06.260]   in dwelling them in this place,
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.000]   in every location,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.980]   maybe at a future day that's listening
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.580]   and I bow my knees before the Father.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:22.460]   And I pray that you would allow Christ to lead our lives.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.660]   And we just say, God, if there is an area
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.780]   where there's redecorating,
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.280]   would you help us by the power of your spirit?
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.320]   I pray that you would allow us to have an awareness
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.380]   of how deeply loved that we are
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.020]   and we would come back to that and come back to that
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.460]   and that would anchor us,
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.580]   that we would live lives that do what your
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:51.100]   younger brother Jude wrote in his letter.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.580]   Keep yourselves in the love of God as you wait,
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.020]   keep yourselves in the love of God.
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:03.900]   And Father, would we seek to be filled and satisfied in you?
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.480]   Forgive us for all the ways that we don't.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.380]   And would you help us by your spirit?
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:20.700]   We pray all of this in the name of Jesus, amen.
