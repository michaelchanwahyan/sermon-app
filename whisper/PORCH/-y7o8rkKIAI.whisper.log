[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.760]   Amen, amazing.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.960]   Hello, friends in the room.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   Hello, friends in Fort Worth and friends in Houston.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.000]   I'm gonna start with a story
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   that'll kinda give us traction for where we're going.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.860]   I have a 10-week-old son named Crew.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.640]   Last week, I was going to, yeah, get excited.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.400]   Last week, I was going to pick him up
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.880]   to leave for work in the morning,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.100]   and I went and picked him up
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.940]   and just held him, gave him a hug,
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.280]   and as I'm holding him,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.440]   I realize he's got this cross-eyed look,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.400]   which is not that unusual going on in his face,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.520]   but something's going on,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.120]   and he looked milk drunk,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200]   which is also not uncommon 'cause he loves milk,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.120]   and I'm looking at him, I'm like,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.440]   "All right, buddy, goodbye,"
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.680]   and right as I go to kiss him on the cheek,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.440]   I get milk thrown up all over my face.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.560]   It is a got milk commercial gone bad,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.640]   all over my face, it's all over the floor,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.360]   and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh,"
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.760]   and the reason why he had thrown up
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.620]   is because really, he does this all the time.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.200]   It's not because he's sick.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320]   He's in this weird stage of life
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.120]   where he can't get enough milk,
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.400]   and even if he drinks until he's full,
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.840]   he throws up, and then he wants more.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   He's just a little milk monster
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600]   wanting to go to Dairy Queen all the time,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.800]   and so he comes up, and he's throwing up on my face,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.160]   and I'm cleaning this up.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.280]   Of course, he wants more milk,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.680]   and we're like, "Buddy, you're okay.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.700]   "You don't need any more milk.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.540]   "It's okay."
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.360]   He's crying.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.200]   He goes ballistic if he doesn't get more milk,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.640]   and so we live in this world right now
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.360]   where we are constantly having to deal
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.080]   with this 10-week-old who,
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.240]   even though he has more than enough,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   he is discontent and wants to have more.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.720]   He just purges out and wants more milk for whatever reason.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.560]   It helps him soothe.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   It helps him find comfort,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.920]   and the fact that he has enough is not enough for him.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.240]   He's discontent despite having enough.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.200]   And the reason I start there is because tonight,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   like Shane said, we are talking about the topic of money
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.880]   and the topic of discontentment
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.920]   because the idea of an infant wanting more milk
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.480]   despite he's full and, "Hey, I had enough,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.680]   "but I still want more,"
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.660]   is kind of okay for an infant
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.760]   when he's in that little stage,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.280]   but honestly, I think if most of us were honest,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.040]   we would say that stage of being discontent
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.240]   despite having enough, "I still want more,"
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800]   despite having enough, "I still want more
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.720]   "and more and more,"
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.160]   is not something that is only for infants
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.200]   and only related to milk,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.280]   but it's very related to the topic of money.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.960]   Most of us in the room came into the room
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.600]   with probably more than enough.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360]   In a global perspective, we'd say,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.260]   "We have more than enough,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.880]   "but there's still something inside of us
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.160]   "that is discontent and wants more,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.200]   "wants more, wants more."
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.000]   And if that wasn't bad enough, we live in a world,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.960]   and social media has made this so we further are exposed
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.880]   and further encouraged to be discontent
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.080]   because everywhere we look,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680]   we are exposed to how much we're missing out on,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.840]   how much everyone else is getting to do that's fun,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360]   and you can, with a click of a button,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.420]   go and see, "Oh my gosh, Instagram.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.800]   "Oh, they're in Maui again.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   "I hate them.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.900]   "Oh man, I wish my job allowed me to travel like that.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200]   "Oh, I wish I could drive a new car like that.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960]   "Oh, I wish I was self-employed.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   "Wish I made that kind of money.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.540]   "I wish I had that many pairs of shoes,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.160]   "or I wish I had that many,"
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.520]   or insert Pinterest or whatever it is.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.760]   We are in this culture and in this place and time
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.400]   where we're further exposed to how much we don't have,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.040]   further enabled to be more and more discontent.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   In fact, tonight, as it relates to the topic of money,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.120]   we strategically planted inside of this room
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.040]   and inside of Fort Worth a few hundred dollars
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.600]   to further drive some discontentment
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.480]   and to use as an illustration later in this message.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.560]   And so underneath some of your seats right now,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.600]   you can look, and there is a $100 bill.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.520]   There's a $50 bill.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.340]   I'm not kidding.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.400]   I would look if I were you.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.100]   It's in your seat right now.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.800]   Not directly underneath.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.560]   It's on the back of your seat pad.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.400]   There's an envelope.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.880]   If you found it, there should be one right down here.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920]   There should be one somewhere over here.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.040]   Yeah, people are checking other chairs.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.240]   I love it.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.360]   It's starting to move.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.200]   This is fantastic.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.440]   Oh man, if you were not discontent before, you are now.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.160]   There it is.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.360]   There's one.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.400]   There's some in Fort Worth too.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.600]   Directly underneath your chair, on the back of your seat.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.900]   If you don't get it, there should be at least six
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.300]   in this room, and we're gonna come back
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.940]   to why those are there.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940]   (laughing)
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.580]   But congratulations if you're sitting
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.180]   in one of those chairs.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.020]   Underneath the back.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.380]   So it's not directly underneath where you could see it.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.920]   It's on the very back of your chair.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.340]   You'd have to like, if you reach the hand
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.720]   directly behind you.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.700]   Oh, there you go.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   Okay, don't reach back and grab somebody's leg.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.260]   Just reach back and you may find it.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.700]   Okay, here we go.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.520]   We're gonna keep going.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.080]   Everyone, I've lost the crowd.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.720]   Let me close in prayer, and we'll end tonight.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.960]   We got one, two, I bet we have six.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.260]   So if you don't have it, you can look afterwards
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.280]   and you'll be able to find it.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.420]   Here's why we, actually I'm gonna come back
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.180]   to why those have been strategically planted there.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.400]   But if you weren't discontented before, you are now.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.680]   And as we topically address the subject of money
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.520]   and how we, as we enter into the world of adulting
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   or really enter into what it looks like
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.160]   as followers of Christ to handle money,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.840]   we want to dive into a passage in 1 Timothy 6.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open there
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.460]   because we live in a world, like we just said,
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.280]   that fuels this idea of discontent,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.260]   that fuels the desire to get more and more
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.800]   and more and more and more money.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.880]   And the Apostle Paul is going to say that desire,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.400]   that discontent, that you did not just come into the room
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.080]   and gain discontent by that $100.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.680]   In other words, all of us came in,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.280]   and before we had ever known that the person sitting next
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.920]   to us just got 50 bucks, we were discontent.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.440]   And we're gonna come back to why those were put
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.920]   in the places that they were.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.800]   But all of us came in, and the Apostle Paul's
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.180]   about to lay out that there is a remedy for discontentment.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.680]   But he's also gonna lay out that there is an extreme danger
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.240]   in discontentment, and the danger is not just,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.400]   oh, you know, you're gonna have a bad day.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.760]   What he says is at stake is not just your future,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.280]   but your faith, that it has the potential to erode
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520]   and destroy your faith, which will then destroy
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.800]   every aspect of your life.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.920]   And so what the Apostle Paul's gonna lay out
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.880]   as we explore the topic of contentment and money
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.660]   and what the scripture says about these two.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.200]   We're gonna start in verse six of chapter six.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.400]   So if you have a Bible, flip to 1 Timothy chapter six.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.240]   Starting in verse six.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.520]   If you don't, it'll be up on the screen.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.560]   1 Timothy is a book written to Timothy,
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.920]   and it was written by the Apostle Paul
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.040]   to this young church leader who's named Timothy.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.880]   He's a young adult.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.680]   He's leading this church in Ephesus,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.260]   and he had been mentored by Paul.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.720]   Paul was like a, he was Paul's protege, if you will.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.480]   Paul mentored him, and he writes this letter
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.600]   to this young adult who's leading this church,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.360]   and he begins to attack or address the topic
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   of money and contentment.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.800]   And we're diving into a conversation
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   that had already been taking place in the verses before it
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.360]   where he's addressing false teachers who had come up,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.600]   who had said, "Godliness is a means to get financial gain."
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.760]   That's in the verse right before it,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.040]   if you wanna go back and read it later.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.600]   Basically, he's saying, "Look out for people
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.740]   "who are gonna come, and they're gonna say,
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.060]   "Look, if you're godly, you're gonna get more money.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.800]   "If you give God a dollar, he's gonna give you 10."
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.200]   That's the kind of person, Timothy,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.280]   you need to stay away from.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   That person is not doing the Lord's work, he says.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   "Godliness is a means of financial gain is corrupt."
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.680]   But there is a godliness that leads to a gain,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.280]   and it involves something else
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.400]   along the topic of commitment.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.280]   So verse six, here we go.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.880]   We're gonna start out with this first idea
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   from the text of contentment has nothing to do with money.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.000]   And if you're sitting next to the person with $50,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.860]   you may not believe me now,
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.560]   but hopefully by the end of this message, you will.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.640]   Contentment has nothing to do with money.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.540]   Here's what he says in verse six.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.560]   "Don't be fooled by those who have said
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.740]   "godliness is a way to get financial gain,
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.800]   "but here's where gain is.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.540]   "But godliness with contentment is great gain."
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.560]   So he's contrasting the idea of financial gain,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.400]   and he says, "Look, there is a great gain
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.280]   "that comes from godliness, but it is a godliness
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   "that is paired up with contentment,
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   "that I'm okay, I'm satisfied,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.380]   "I don't have to have more, I'm not in constant need
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.280]   "of wanting more and more and more stuff.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.740]   "That if you have a discontentment problem,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.920]   "your solution, money, is not the answer to your problem."
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.520]   In other words, getting more and more.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.840]   What he says, he says, "There is no relationship
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.000]   "between contentment and money.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.560]   "If you get more money, you will not be any more content,"
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   the apostle Paul says.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.200]   "If you get more and more, you will not be any more content.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.540]   "The more you have, not necessarily
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.400]   "the less that you want.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   "Getting more will not leave you wanting less."
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   We know this, right?
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   There isn't a relationship between our happiness in life,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.240]   our contentment in life, our joy, our satisfaction,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.400]   and the things that we acquire.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.000]   There is for like an hour and a half,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.800]   and then it's like, "Ah, this is kind of worthless.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.240]   "I want the next one."
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.760]   We live in a world where constantly,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.320]   especially as Americans, probably the clearest way
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   you see this is with your phone, right?
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.320]   Who has the iPhone 6 right here?
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.160]   Anybody?
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.560]   Who has the iPhone 6S?
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.420]   Oh my gosh, I love it.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.320]   We live in a world where we're constantly being bombarded
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.200]   with, "Hey, upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   "Get this next one."
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.980]   And when we get it, it's like, "This is awesome.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.200]   "I'm gonna keep this clean for like three days."
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   And then it's got a spider web on it,
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.300]   and you're like, "I hate this thing.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.280]   "When's the iPhone 7 coming out?"
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.820]   We live in a world that's constantly saying,
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.960]   "If you will just get more, get more, get more,"
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.760]   especially as America.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.440]   Like, we are so good at this,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.220]   and we are so engaged in trying to get more,
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.720]   we don't even allow our stuff to be replaced anymore.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.700]   We do something called upgrade.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.020]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.260]   Like, nobody in this room, or most of us in this room,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.380]   weren't like, "You know what happened?
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.180]   "I was using the iPhone 1,
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.880]   "and then it started disintegrating,
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.840]   "and so I moved up to the 6."
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.960]   We just go, "What, you're still on the 4?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.380]   "You know, you can upgrade for free,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.080]   "and by free, I mean $25 a month,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.540]   "but you can still upgrade.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.860]   "It's called Next."
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.740]   We don't even allow, we don't replace things anymore.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.820]   We drive a car till it's 100,000 miles,
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.700]   and then we're like, "I think I should trade this in.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.860]   "I'm not sure what to do with it beyond this."
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.060]   We don't even replace things like a TV.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.640]   You're like, "There's an LED, this LCD.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.820]   "This thing is worthless.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.420]   "I need to upgrade."
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.100]   We no longer live in a world where we're like,
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.360]   "Oh, things need to be replaced."
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.220]   We're so good at getting more, and more, and more,
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.020]   and yet at the same time, if we were all honest,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.840]   we're going, "It's not gonna bring
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.700]   "any more satisfaction in your life."
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.300]   And that's the Apostle Paul's point,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.740]   that there is no relationship between contentment,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.860]   between your standard of living, and your income,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.540]   or the amount of stuff that you have.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.480]   I mean, this is so huge.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.180]   This means that right now, as much as I think all of us
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.160]   would go, "Man, I could really use more money.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.340]   "I would like to make more money."
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.640]   The Apostle Paul says, "Your contentment in life,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.860]   "your joy, your happiness, you could double
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.360]   "your salary right now, and you would still,
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.820]   "if you were discontent, find yourself discontent,
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.300]   "or find yourself wanting more."
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.140]   In other words, if you make $50,000,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.140]   and we say, "Oh, tomorrow you make $100,000,"
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.940]   you will then just move everything up,
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.420]   and still find yourself wanting more,
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.420]   and more, and more, this appetite.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.160]   And the Apostle Paul says, "Do not be fooled.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.140]   "Gain, and great gain in this world
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.700]   "has nothing to do with money.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.660]   "Contentment is not found in having money.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.460]   "Don't buy the lie that the world around you
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.580]   "is trying to sell you."
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.260]   And he gives an indication further
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.780]   into a truth about money.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.840]   He says this, "For we brought nothing into the world,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.440]   "and we can take nothing out of it.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.680]   "But if we have food and clothing,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.580]   "we will be content with that."
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.880]   So the Apostle Paul says, "Look, you brought nothing
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.720]   "into this world."
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.780]   Here's the second idea about money.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.820]   This is not our second point, first in this one,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.100]   or just another idea within this passage,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.180]   is he says, "Look, money, the idea of you bring nothing
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.920]   "into this world, and you take nothing out of it
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.720]   "means this, you are a steward.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.000]   "You are not an owner.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.440]   "Just like you came into this world with nothing,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.760]   "you will die with nothing.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.320]   "You cannot take anything with you.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.240]   "Everything that you have is passing through your hands
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.820]   "like sand.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.020]   "You do not own any of it.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.060]   "You are a steward of all of it."
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.920]   And the Apostle Paul says, "Look, Steve Jobs,
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.660]   "right now, is worth zero.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.060]   "If great gain is only about getting more and more
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.860]   "and more and more money, then at the end of our life,
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.940]   "there's no such thing as gain,
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.340]   "because you lose everything."
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.740]   And he says, "Look, we brought nothing in,
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.660]   "we'll take nothing out.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.520]   "There is a gain, but it has nothing to do
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.380]   "with how much money you get."
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.620]   And while you're here on this earth,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.880]   you are not an owner, you are a steward
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.620]   of every dollar that you have.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.340]   It's all temporarily in your hands,
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.060]   and it's all leaving.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.100]   And the Bible says, "For followers of Christ,
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.420]   "as a steward, you are a steward and not an owner."
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.040]   Which means every dollar that you have,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.620]   you are stewarding, you're managing God's money.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.480]   Now, why did we put money in the chairs
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.140]   of six people in this room,
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.200]   and I think six people in Fort Worth?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   To illustrate this point,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.380]   those of you who got that money,
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.680]   if you have the $100, if you have the 20s,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.060]   or if you have the 50, whatever amount that you got,
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.980]   we want you to use that money for a specific purpose,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.020]   not on yourself, but on a kingdom investment.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.020]   We want you to take that money,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.820]   we want you to use it towards some organization
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.820]   that is Christ, for the cause of Christ, if you will,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.340]   whether you're in Fort Worth or whether you're in Dallas.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.540]   We're asking, do not use that money on yourself.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.960]   We're saying, this is a kingdom investment.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.600]   You are to steward this investment,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.740]   you are not the owner of it, you are a steward of it.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.940]   Now, everyone in the room that was jealous
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.500]   of not getting the $100 is a little less jealous.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.320]   Have you noticed that?
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.060]   We're like, oh, they can't even use it on themselves.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.660]   I don't care about that anymore.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.160]   That's how we're to see all money.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.440]   It's not yours, and it's not mine.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.600]   That just like in that situation, like, oh, I get it,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.120]   they don't even really get to use it for themselves,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.740]   they're supposed to like steward it.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.700]   That's how we're to see every dollar
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.420]   that passes through your hands and it passes through mine.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.520]   And even the fact that there's a little bit of like,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.740]   oh, I'm kind of sadder that I can't use this
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.300]   to make myself happier reflects the idea
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.220]   that we don't believe what Paul is saying is true.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.500]   Money has nothing to do with contentment, with happiness.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.220]   But he's about to lay out why contentment is not,
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.300]   or discontentment is not something to play with,
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.820]   but it is a danger that will destroy your life.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.660]   And it is something that is a sin
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.220]   that leads you down a path like few other sins
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.300]   in scripture, especially in the language he's about to use
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.940]   as it says to this idea of getting more and more,
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.420]   aka greed, and how dangerous it is.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.760]   Here's what he says.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.920]   Verse nine, "Those who want to get rich,"
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.940]   not those who are rich,
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.620]   those who want, or the word long, strongly desire,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.360]   those who lust after riches,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.580]   those who want to live more richly,
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.500]   those who direct the course of their life to getting more,
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.340]   and to getting more, and to getting more,
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.460]   "they fall into temptation and a trap,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.640]   "and into many foolish and harmful desires
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.060]   "that plunge people into ruin and destruction."
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.260]   I mean, look at the language he's using.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.580]   The people who want to get rich, they fall into a trap,
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.540]   and they plunge themselves.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.740]   They lead themselves into a situation
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.860]   of ruin and destruction.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.900]   I think the two traps, and it's such a perfect word
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.540]   because a lot of us, I think, in the room,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.380]   as we describe our financial situation, what do you feel?
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.100]   Trapped.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.940]   Like I'm in a car where I'm upside down.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.620]   I'm in a lease where I can't really afford it.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.780]   I have to stay at this job right now
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.700]   because I cannot afford to leave
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.600]   because it would mean my standard of living
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.440]   would have to decrease.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.460]   I'd have to get rid of the car.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.380]   I'm trapped.
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.140]   And the apostle Paul says,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.940]   "Look, you, like every other person in our world,
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.100]   "especially in America, is in danger.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.340]   "If you do not have a hold on your discontent,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.060]   "it will lead you down a path towards destruction."
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.800]   Our second idea is the danger of discontentment
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.340]   where the apostle Paul lays out it is a trap.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.540]   I think the trap takes place in two different ways
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.980]   that we see described in Scripture.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.420]   One trap that Scripture lays out as it relates to money
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.460]   is that the deceitfulness of money
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.140]   is that you never think you have enough.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.100]   Like no matter how much you get, you're like,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.300]   "Oh, I need a few more dollars.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.100]   "I wish I could get a little bit richer."
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.260]   Ecclesiastes 5, the richest man ever,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.100]   Solomon says this idea about,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.060]   "Hey, whoever loves money will never have enough."
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.180]   John Rockefeller, who was worth 340 billion,
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.780]   he makes Bill Gates look like a beginner,
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.120]   340 billion was asked famously,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.460]   "Hey, how much money would be enough for you?"
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.940]   One more dollar.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.440]   Rich is a moving target.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.860]   That's the danger of riches and pursuing riches
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.780]   because you are chasing a rabbit
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.260]   that will always remain in front of you
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.020]   no matter how far you run on the track.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.940]   And the danger of riches
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.460]   is that they will never ever be enough, even today.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.500]   Not long ago, this year, in May of this year,
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.360]   NBC put out a survey studying millionaires in our nation.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.340]   People who made between one and $5 million,
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.740]   NBC surveyed a bunch of millionaires.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.020]   These are multimillionaires.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.280]   I make multimillion a year,
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.640]   and they asked them how they perceived themselves
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.180]   and how they looked at themselves.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.100]   4% thought they were rich.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.220]   In other words, if you make between one and $5 million,
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.900]   a multimillionaire, only 4%,
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.580]   the vast majority was like, "I'm middle class.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.360]   "I'm a blue collar guy, just like you.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.260]   "I mean, it's insane.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.500]   "Think about that."
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.860]   But that's the deceitfulness of riches
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.880]   is you'll never have enough.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:46.720]   You're gonna be in this trap,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.300]   I need to make more, I need to make more.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   And then your lifestyle is gonna rise with that,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.780]   so then you will be trapped into having to make more.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.760]   That's the second idea,
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.500]   is really the trap of riches
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.460]   and the trap of pursuing to be riches
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.780]   is all of a sudden, not only is our income goes up,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.900]   our standard of living will go up with it,
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.460]   and we put golden handcuffs on ourselves.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.620]   And we end up finding men with incredible anxiety
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.460]   who make $300,000 a year, but they're going,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.940]   "How am I gonna afford private school?
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.100]   "We got this yacht.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.740]   "How am I gonna afford all these things?"
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.100]   And they put golden handcuffs on themselves
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.180]   and live a life filled with anxiety,
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.660]   filled with discontentment.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.060]   And Paul says, "Look, if you allow this trap
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.380]   "to take you down the path of discontentment,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.780]   "if you do not get a hold on this appetite
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.140]   "that is not relieved by feeding it more,
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.520]   "but by being controlled,"
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.420]   and we're gonna talk about how that takes place,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.260]   "if you don't get a troll,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.800]   "it will lead you down a path towards destruction
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   "and something even worse, for the love of money," Timothy.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.020]   This is a very misquoted verse.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.340]   For the love of money, not money.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.780]   "Is the root of all kinds of evil."
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.180]   Not all evil.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.620]   It's often quoted, money is the root of all evil.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.900]   That is not in the Bible.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.780]   For the love of money, the lust for more
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.220]   is the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.920]   It's the reason many of you have parents who divorced.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.780]   It's the reason much of the subprime mortgage,
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.420]   just circumstances that we found ourselves in in 2008
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.980]   and the catastrophe, and the catastrophe,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.140]   and the catastrophe that took place after that took place.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.660]   Greed, the love of money
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.340]   is the root of all kinds of evil,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.640]   and some people, Timothy,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.060]   and you can almost hear the emotion in his voice,
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.360]   "Eager for more money, have wandered away from the faith,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.020]   "and they pierced themselves with many griefs."
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.460]   Some people, Timothy,
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.420]   they've taken just one step after the next,
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.940]   and all of a sudden, they've found themselves
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.380]   in a situation where they can't leave their job anymore,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.180]   and they can't be a part of a local church anymore,
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.780]   they can't serve God anymore, they can't give anymore,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.020]   because they've made decisions
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.900]   that have taken them down a financial path,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.940]   and all of a sudden, it's led them even away
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.700]   from their own faith.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.380]   I mean, think about that.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.420]   How extreme is the language he's using here,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.760]   where they've pierced themselves?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.780]   When else does Paul talk like this?
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.620]   And he's saying, "Timothy, watch out.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.680]   "The power of greed can lead you down a path
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.180]   "that is even away from God,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.360]   "and you'll walk away from your faith
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.740]   "without even realizing the danger of discontentment."
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.380]   I know in this room, the trap has manifested itself
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.220]   in a lot of different ways.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.080]   It's kept some of you in a job, where you're like,
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.900]   "Yeah, of course I have to keep working in iBanking,
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.520]   "because I have bills to pay, I have this car that I have,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.920]   "I'm leasing a BMW, duh.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.200]   "Of course I have to continue to work at this bar.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.080]   "The tips are unbelievable.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.500]   "Money has made this trap."
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.140]   Some of you are going, "I can't get married yet.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.260]   "I'm gonna keep dating Beverly for the next seven years,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.300]   "because I can't afford it.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.260]   "I got all kinds of debt that are coming."
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.940]   Some of you are going, "I need to get married,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.240]   "because I need a sugar mama
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.720]   "who can help pay down this debt,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.540]   "and is driving all kinds of different decisions
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.560]   "in this room, especially as it relates to debt."
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.580]   Man, this is a side note, it's a tangent.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.460]   Tangent.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.080]   I know the averages for the debt amounts in this room
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   as it relates to credit card and college loans
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.400]   are out of control.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.200]   And some of you were fortunate enough to have parents
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.960]   who paid all the way through college,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.000]   and others of you were not able to do that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.940]   But wherever you are in that spectrum,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.720]   please use this season right now.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.440]   If you are staring down the barrel of a lot of debt,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.120]   you too, and for Oreth, to pay off that debt,
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.080]   that is something you do not wanna bring
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.640]   with you into marriage.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.700]   You are gonna bring those financial problems,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.600]   financial stresses into marriage,
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.720]   so do whatever you have to to begin to pay that down,
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.940]   hopefully get rid of it,
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.520]   but you do not wanna carry those things with you
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.560]   into marriage, where you have to go,
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.200]   "Oh yeah, look, I want you to meet my friend.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.040]   "You heard of Master P?
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.020]   "Here's MasterCard, come on with me.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.040]   "Here, I want you to meet my friend.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.140]   "Not Lisa, this is Visa, and this is my $10,000 debt,
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.120]   "and I'm bringing it with me.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.320]   "And here's the twins, called student loans,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.560]   "and they're with me to stay too."
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.360]   Where you don't have to bring those things in
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.680]   and add anything else to the beginning of a marriage.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.660]   Use this season, please use this season
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.760]   to begin to pay off that debt.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.620]   Make cuts wherever you need to.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.340]   A car, maybe you gotta downgrade from the 4Runner
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.940]   and just get a Corolla.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.740]   I don't know, Corollas are great.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.380]   Downgrade from the, and 4Runners are great too,
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.540]   but do whatever you have to to financially
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.580]   set yourself in a place where you can pursue oneness,
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.260]   pursue marriage, and be on the right step towards that,
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.380]   and be ready for when God brings that right person
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.380]   or right someone along.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.880]   All right, here we go, keep going.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.140]   The cure for discontentment.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.340]   So Paul lays out, he's saying,
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.720]   "Look, there's a danger in discontentment.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.700]   "It will lead you astray.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.160]   "It can even lead you away from God,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.580]   "but there is a cure, Timothy,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.900]   "and I want you to know about it."
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.060]   And Paul's life really models the cure
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.560]   as well as anyone that I know.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.900]   And he says this in verse 11.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.300]   "But you, O man of God," as we explore the third point,
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.800]   "the cure for discontentment is Christ."
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.620]   The cure for discontentment is Christ.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620]   "But you," verse 11, "man of God, flee from all of this."
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.040]   What is all of this?
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.400]   Materialism, the desire for more,
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.560]   the fact that, yes, of course I have to have an iPhone,
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.320]   of course I have to drive this kind of car,
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.720]   of course I have to live in this area,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.000]   of course I have to get newer clothes.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Hey, flee from all of that.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.400]   There's only two times, his language is so extreme
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.280]   in this passage, two times the apostle Paul
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.640]   talks about fleeing something.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.060]   One of them is sexuality.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.520]   And I think a lot of us are going,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.080]   yes, I wanna be on guard, I'm at least aware of the fact
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.840]   that I should flee from this.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.720]   And the other place he talks about it is right here
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   where he says, look, flee materialism.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.600]   It's gonna suck you down a culture,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.760]   you're gonna step onto a path that will not end
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.680]   until it has destroyed you, destroyed your future,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.160]   and destroyed even your faith.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.000]   And the fact that you don't believe me
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.480]   is just a testament to the fact
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.280]   that you may be moving in that direction.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.800]   He says, look, greed, like very few other things,
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.340]   Timothy, flee.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.040]   Don't be careful with it.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.420]   Don't get in the cage with a lion
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.320]   and say, I'm just gonna be careful in here.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.880]   He says, when it comes to the topic of greed and money,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.720]   flee from it, run in the opposite direction,
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.680]   in this direction, and pursue righteousness,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.200]   I think personally this week, I was like so convicted
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.520]   because I, like you, live in Dallas
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   in a culture where we are constantly being pushed
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.620]   towards keeping up with the Joneses,
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:42.540]   keeping up with making more, dressing a certain way,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.340]   having a certain amount, living in a certain neighborhood,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.120]   buying a home by a certain age.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.780]   And all around me, I can feel this pressure
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.260]   to have more and more, and I need more and more and more,
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.820]   and I feel this inside of my heart.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.660]   And I think I came in to even studying for this message
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.600]   very aware that, hey, I'm a pervert as it relates to lust.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.580]   I need covenant eyes on everything I own.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.640]   I know my temptations is gonna be to long after someone
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.720]   who's not my wife, so I wanna make sure I keep that
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.360]   in front of my community, I keep that in check.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.280]   I'm very much, I wanna flee from that.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.360]   And I don't think that I do this,
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.920]   where I flee from materialism,
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   like the scripture calls me to.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   And even in the shows that I watch and just navigating,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.320]   what am I feeding my heart?
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.840]   We just did a remodel in a home.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.760]   One of our favorite shows is Fixer Upper.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.000]   And even watching that, I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.700]   I continue to feel this desire for more and more,
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.660]   like I'm feeding this discontent.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   And being convicted of like, Lord,
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.060]   what am I feeding my heart?
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.860]   How am I being led and deceived down this path?
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.300]   Will you help me to experience the cure
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.100]   for that discontentment which is found in Christ alone,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.760]   which is why he tells Timothy,
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.500]   look, don't just run away from it.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.740]   Don't just be intentional about what you're feeding
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.060]   your heart, who you're surrounding yourself with,
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.820]   how you're spending.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.560]   I want you to pursue faithfulness, things of the faith.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.040]   I want you to pursue Christ.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.360]   And here's what I think Paul knew.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.280]   And I'll close with just talking a little bit
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.560]   about Paul's life and then about this true treasure
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.800]   that the scriptures reveal that Paul knew of,
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   which is Christ.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.720]   Paul, who instructs Timothy,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   I want you to run after faithfulness.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.800]   I want you to run after faith, love,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.900]   endurance, righteousness.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.840]   I want you to run after all of these qualities
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.640]   that are found in your faith, found in Christ.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.020]   I think Paul knew that when you do that, Timothy,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.720]   if that's the pursuit of your life,
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.700]   in other words, you could just insert for all of those,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.760]   pursue after Christ.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.120]   When you do that, Timothy, what you will discover
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.320]   is he is the greatest treasure of this life.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.880]   Your hands will all of a sudden be opened up
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.960]   because you're encountering the greatest treasure,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   the truest treasure.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.680]   In other words, the cure for contentment
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.240]   and the cure for discontentment in your life and mine
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.160]   is not just me saying like, look, be fine with what you have.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.840]   You got great treasures, you should like 'em,
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.200]   hold on to 'em, but it's finding
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.780]   a superior treasure in Christ.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.940]   Like, what other hope do we have
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.600]   as it relates to discontentment?
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.400]   Really, and we're just gonna like, oh, I'm fine,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.280]   I don't want anymore.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.760]   We live in a city, we live in a world
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.560]   that's gonna constantly push us to the edge,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.080]   and Christ and all of that, the only remedy
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.480]   for the cure of discontentment
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.500]   or to find a cure for discontentment
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.480]   is to find the superior treasure,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   the truest treasure, who is Christ.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.900]   And Paul instructs Timothy, look, run after this,
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.240]   and you will discover the one
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   who is worth giving everything up,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.360]   the one who makes every other earthly treasure
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.040]   look so small, the one where true life is found,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.600]   the one who Paul says about in Philippians 3
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.560]   as it relates to everything in his world,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.880]   he says this about Christ, that knowing him,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.720]   knowing the true treasure that's Jesus
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.960]   has broken the chains of discontentment
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.820]   in Paul's life, and he says this, verse eight
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.980]   of chapter three in Philippians.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.980]   I consider everything loss because of the surpassing worth
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.060]   of knowing Christ, Jesus my Lord,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.580]   for whose sake I have lost everything.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   Paul, you lost everything, I lost my house,
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.380]   I lost my job, I lost my income, I lost everything.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.480]   Man, Paul, that must be rough.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.020]   Not for me, I consider them garbage
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.820]   that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.460]   not having a righteousness of my own
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.800]   that comes from the law, but that which is through faith
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.180]   in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.240]   on the basis of faith.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.700]   I wanna know Christ.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.820]   Yes, to know the power of his resurrection,
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.520]   to participate in his sufferings,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   become like him in his death, and so attaining
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.840]   the resurrection of the dead.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.000]   Paul says, look, I've lost everything,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.320]   and I don't even care about it.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.040]   It's all garbage, or the word dung.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.000]   It's all trash to me.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.880]   I've lost it all, and I don't care
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   because the greatest thing in my life
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   is the truest treasure.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.320]   Every other treasure shrunk and became so small
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.120]   in comparison to knowing Christ.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.060]   And I read that, and I'm like you,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.240]   and maybe you're someone who's like,
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.920]   oh, dude, I am Amish, and I don't have anything.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.880]   I live in this city, and that feels so far from me.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.740]   And I want that to be the story of my life
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.200]   where I go, look, everything, God,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.960]   I want it to all shrink away
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.360]   compared to the truest treasure, which is Jesus.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.300]   I don't wanna spend my life chasing little trinkets.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.560]   When am I gonna get a newer car?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.000]   I drive a 2004 Tahoe.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.840]   I don't wanna spend it going, when can I upgrade
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.000]   on Craigslist to the 2010?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I wanna spend my life pursuing Jesus,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.700]   and the only way that I know how to get there
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.480]   is by looking at what the apostle Paul says
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.200]   made it happen to him, is when he began to discover
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.920]   through knowing Christ, I can see that Jesus
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.880]   is the greatest treasure, the truest treasure,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.120]   the treasure of all existence,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.600]   the treasure that we're gonna worship
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   for all of existence, for all of eternity,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.040]   and the thing that will free your hands up
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.060]   from your greed, the thing that will allow you
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.640]   to be generous is not by just going,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.440]   I'm gonna try harder, and I'm gonna feel guilty,
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.740]   but by knowing Christ and in knowing him,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.080]   you see the truest treasure, the greatest treasure.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.040]   Even the story that we find of this idea
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   of treasure in heaven, when you read in Revelation 21,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.680]   and I'm gonna close right here,
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.360]   when you read in Revelation 21, and John,
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.520]   the apostle John, who was one of Jesus' best friend,
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.660]   he writes about heaven, and he begins to describe
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.580]   what heaven's like, and even the terms
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.940]   and the materials that make up heaven,
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.720]   the things that are used for building materials,
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.260]   the things for asphalt, it's like he uses
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.080]   everything that we value in this world.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.520]   He looks around, and he says, look,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.220]   the streets, it's like they're made of gold.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.280]   The sheet rock up there, it's pearls and emeralds
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.600]   and all these different diamonds
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.400]   and all these different jewels,
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.320]   and he says, everywhere that you look around,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.740]   and he begins to tell out as though
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.620]   he's sending us a message that the things
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.500]   that we value in this life, the things
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.960]   that we think are so valuable,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.280]   especially his audience would have in the first century,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.600]   emeralds, he says, yeah, gold, yeah,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.260]   it's like when you get there, they're asphalt,
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.240]   they're nothing, all the things you treasure
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.540]   in this life, when you get to heaven,
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.540]   one day we're all gonna see all these earthly treasures
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.440]   are pushed aside to make way for the treasure
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.420]   of the ages, whose name is Jesus,
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.800]   and in this life, the thing that will free you and I up
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:35.160]   from discontentment, from wanting more treasure,
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   is knowing the truest treasure,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.820]   the treasure of all life,
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.780]   and as I wrestled with even just this message
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.240]   and we were going, hey, we wanna cover money,
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.380]   we wanna cover how we can steward God's resources,
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.420]   and we think all of you should,
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.280]   what's gonna change your discontentment,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.800]   and this is a huge epidemic in our city,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.000]   in my heart, and I know in this room,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.180]   what's gonna change your heart
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.960]   is not gonna be some message on money,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.880]   it's gonna be encountering Jesus and seeing him.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.720]   The Bible even says that's how we're changed,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.960]   is when we're introduced to the truest treasure,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   and the apostle Paul writes and he says,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.280]   look, I have found it, and in another place he says,
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   I know the secret of being content, and it's Jesus.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.100]   I know the secret of being generous, and it's Jesus.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.940]   And the remedy for your greed and for mine is him, is him.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.980]   As we just explore this topic of money,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.140]   we know there are people all across the board
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.740]   on the spectrum of finances,
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.340]   and some of you feel in a place
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.340]   where you're going, I feel trapped.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.100]   We would love to talk with you more,
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.580]   but there is a class that I think everyone in this room
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.140]   should take called Money Wise,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.540]   where as you walk through finances,
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.900]   you don't have to do it alone,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.500]   you don't even have to do it just for your community,
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.660]   we'd encourage you, but you can have financial counselors
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.860]   who come around, equip and care for.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.820]   And we think everyone should give.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.580]   If you were given that money, please give,
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.860]   do not give it here, give it to some kingdom-minded
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.860]   organization, and we hope you're generous,
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.900]   but more than any of that,
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.900]   we think that the right path to step onto,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.540]   the thing that will break the chains of discontentment,
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.300]   break the golden handcuffs,
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.140]   is gonna be knowing the true treasure.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.420]   And if you know him and you're pursuing him,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.740]   everything else will fall into place.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.220]   Well, David, how much should I give?
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.140]   What does it look like to steward really well?
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.740]   If you're pursuing the true treasure,
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.660]   it'll work itself out.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   Be generous, as you reflect the God who you worship
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.180]   who's generous, generous enough to even give his son,
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.940]   but it's him, it's Jesus.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.420]   And this whole message of money is just to showcase,
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.900]   it's just to showcase and show him.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.460]   He's the remedy for our discontentment.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.180]   He's the one who can bring change.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.900]   He's the one that Paul says,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.740]   "Everything else I push aside with ease,"
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.700]   just to know him.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.580]   I'm gonna pray that we would.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.420]   Let me pray.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.240]   Father, thank you.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.380]   For some of us, you have introduced us already
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.400]   to the true treasure, our Savior.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.220]   I pray that, Lord, I wanna treasure Jesus.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.620]   I wanna say with Paul that everything else is a loss
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.900]   compared to knowing you.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:43.240]   Would you help us, Lord, we're so easily distracted.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.380]   Would you help us to know, pursue, step onto that path
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:52.340]   of seeing Jesus as the true treasure,
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.500]   the treasure that one day we will see
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.780]   he's always been the most valuable thing.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.720]   He'll always be the most valuable thing.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.460]   I pray that that would take place before we go to heaven
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.260]   or even the building materials testify,
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.780]   you're the treasure, you're the king.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.740]   We worship you now.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.180]   Would you convince us of that reality
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.900]   that you are our treasure?
