[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The book of James is made up of 108 verses.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   54 of them are imperatives.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   An imperative is a command.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   [Music]
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   That Jesus was not just his half-brother.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   He was his Lord.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   All right, what's up, friends of the room,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   friends of Fort Worth and Scottsdale, Arizona, Houston, Texas, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Southwest Minnesota, Northwest Arkansas, anybody joining us online.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We are continuing this series on the book of James.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I'm going to read the passage.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   We're going to be in a James chapter 4.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   So if you have a Bible, you can flip open to James chapter 4,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   start in verse 10, and we are going to continue this series
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   where we have been going week by week, verse by verse,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   through the book of James.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So he says, starting in verse 10, if you don't have a Bible,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   it will be up on the screens.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   or speak evil against one another.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   speaks against God's law and judges it.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   When you judge the law, you're not keeping it,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   but sitting in judgment on it.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   There is only one lawgiver and judge
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   who is able to save and destroy.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's God.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But you, who are you to judge your neighbor?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   we will go to this city or that city,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.'
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Why?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   What is your life?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You are a mist that appears for a little while
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and then vanishes.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   we will live and do this or that.'
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   All such boasting is evil.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   If anyone then knows the good that they ought to do
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and doesn't do it, it is sin for them."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Tonight, we're going to talk about the topic of pride.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   When you read that passage, you may go,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Wait, wait, connect the dots on how it's pride."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Well, he brings up and describes the pastor, James,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   the half-brother of Jesus,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   of somebody who lives a life that is not marked by humility,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   where he starts out of humbling, and he says at the end,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   "There's an arrogance that marks them,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and how they see their life and how they interact with people,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   how they think about their plans,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   how they make decisions in their actions."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Pride is one of those things that candidly can be hard
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   because it's difficult to see in the mirror.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's an easy thing often to see in the life of somebody else,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   but it can be hard for us to see it in ourself.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   This past week, I was at my son's--it was Thursday night.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   My son had a t-ball game. We're at the t-ball game.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's like the greatest thing ever to go to your son's t-ball game.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We're having a blast. He's up there. They're learning how to hit.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   He's up to bat, and I'm holding my daughter at the time,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and she is, like, kind of fidgety, kind of squirming,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   just, like, doing barrel rolls while I'm trying to hold her,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and I'm trying to film my son, who's going up to the tee,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and, you know, go get him slugger, and she continues to move.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I can just tell she's kind of uncomfortable, and I'm thinking,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   "Man, it's because it's about to be pastor bedtime.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's hot out here." Of course she's uncomfortable,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   but, hey, just settle in. I'm trying to capture some video.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   As I'm doing that, I hear this--
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   [coughs]
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and this audible, "Oh, gosh!"
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   from the people sitting right behind me
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   as my daughter just-- [gags]
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   all over my shoulder, and I pull her back to go,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   "Oh, no. What's happening?"
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And she unloads a dumpster of vomit
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   unlike anything I've ever seen.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I hope you're not eating, and I'm not trying to make you sick right now,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   but it was shocking. I mean, the amount--
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I've never seen that much come out of a human,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   let alone somebody who's this tall,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and it just continued, and there were chunks
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   all over me from my neck to my knees
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   to the point where the entire bleachers at the game,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   it goes from like, "Go, Billy. You got this,"
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   to, "Oh! Oh! Whoa!"
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   People are pouring--they're running over with water bottles,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   trying to pour them on me, literally,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   to get the chunks that are off.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I mean, whatever you're thinking, worse.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   A guy, a total stranger--I don't even know who it is still--
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   came up and was like, "Here, you can have my shirt."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That's a true story.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I did a picture of it, but it's not really worth showing,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   but a random stranger, "I have your shirt, so if you're out there,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   thank you, Good Samaritan, or Angel."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And it was just one of those, like, "Oh, man."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And in the moment, I was like, "No, I'm good. I don't need your shirt."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And he was like, "No, you need this shirt."
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And I'm sitting there, and as I was thinking about this idea,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I mean, it was very noticeable.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   "Hey, I needed to change that shirt. I needed something else.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It was not okay for me to just go back, and I'm just going to sit down,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and everything will be okay, and we'll just, you know, pat up and play here."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   That I was covered in something that was so disgusting,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   whether or not I wanted to change shirt or get rid of it
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   or do anything about it, it was clear to everyone around me,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   this is not okay, and it's disgusting.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   What does that have to do with pride?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Nothing. I just needed to tell somebody about what happened this past week. No.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   In the same way, and not in, honestly, even a joking way,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   pride is one of those things that is covering so many people.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And you can look on, and in a very similar way,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   you see it, and pride is one of those things where it's just,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   there's something repelling about it. It's disgusting.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Someone just came into the room, and your life, your actions, words,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   the way that you think, is covered in pride.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Pride is one of those things that can be incredibly disruptive.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's not just disgusting, where other people are like,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   "Man, that is just, I'm repelled by that."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   It also is destructive, and that pride erodes relationships.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's impossible to have a relationship with someone who will never say,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   "You know what? I was wrong. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?"
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's impossible to have a relationship with someone who's prideful
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   because they're so obsessed with themselves,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and how everybody else didn't do everything for them and that person.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's difficult to be in a dating relationship with someone who's so prideful.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They're always right, and you're always wrong.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And pride can also not just look like, hey, a confident arrogance over the top.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It can also look like a person who's self-obsessed in an insecure way.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm so consumed with how I'm terrible, and I'm a terrible person.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That same self-centered focus exists there.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Whether it's an outlandish pride, arrogance,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   or it's the pride of just, I'm not worthy of anything.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Both of those can be examples of pride.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Pride is one of those things that can be repelling,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   it can be destructive to relationships, and it can--
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   is the thing that will keep people from having a relationship with God,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   from spending eternity with God,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   because they're not able to say, God,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I'll never be good enough to have a relationship with you.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   No matter how hard I try, church--
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   number of times I attend church, Bible verses I've read,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'll never earn a relationship with you,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   which is what Christianity believes.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But it does believe that you can accept it
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   by accepting the free gift that was offered to you and me on the cross.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And James today is going to go through
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and help us see those blind spots of pride
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and where pride may manifest in our life
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and help give clarity to here's some ways
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   this is manifesting in your life.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   We say around here that humility looks good on everyone.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Humility is the little black dress that looks good every time.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And in the same way, pride is one of those things
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   that just looks disgusting on everyone.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So here's what I know. Let me promise you something.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Guy or girl, if you walked into the room tonight
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and you want to leave more attractive tonight,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   if you will begin to put on humility,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   you will be more attractive.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You got hit with the ugly stick when you were growing up, whatever happened,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   you will leave here more attractive no matter what you look.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Whatever girl out there is going to find you more attractive.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Whatever guy out there will find you more attractive
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   if you put on humility.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And if you don't, and you allow pride to cover you,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   it is a repelling, disgusting thing
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   and a destructive thing as we're going to see.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So we're going to walk through in verse 10.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   We've been in the series, the book of James.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   James is written by James, the half-brother of Jesus,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   which is astounding to me. I never get over that.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The guy who grew up, Jesus had a younger brother, half-brother.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And he grew up and he lived in the same house with Jesus.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   He learned all the teachings from Jesus.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   He wasn't always a believer. For years and years, he wasn't.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then he saw his brother die on the cross and come back alive.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And James became a believer in Jesus.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   But James saw Jesus all throughout the stages of growing up.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And he learned the teachings that he writes down
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   in the earliest book in the New Testament called the book of James.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And tonight we're going to walk through what he says
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   is the posture of someone who's proud
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and the humility that is to mark followers of Jesus.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   So we're going to look at three things
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   where you might struggle with pride
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   if your life is marked by these three things.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   We're going to look at three things that you might struggle with pride
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   if you and your life is marked by these things.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I'm going to start with the first one. Read it again.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "Brothers and sisters, do not speak evil of one another.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   "Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister judges them,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   "and he speaks against God's law."
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   In other words, he doesn't look at God's law,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   what God says about people, their neighbor, other believers, people in life.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   He says, "I don't care what God thinks about them.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   "Here's what I think about them."
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   When you judge the law, you're not keeping it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   You're sitting in judgment on the law.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   In other words, you think you're better than God.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   There's only one lawgiver and judge, and it's not you, and it's not me.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's the one who's able to save and destroy.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   But who are you to judge your neighbor?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   So James brings up this idea of speaking evil, speaking bad about,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   speaking in a condemning way towards other people,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   whether it's directly to them or whether it's behind their back.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Your translation may have the word "slander" and may have "speak evil,"
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but it's just the idea of, "Hey, I am going to place and speak
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   "and put judgment on this person.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "They're not a good person because of X."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And James said, "The first way you know you might struggle with pride
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "is if you put people down."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   This is the type of person that considers people--
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   classifies, and we all do this to some degree.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   When you think of people, and we can all think of people,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   where it's like, "Man, you're a worse person than I am because of blank."
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Because of the sin struggle that you have or the past that you have,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   you are worse or not as good of a person as I.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And James says that mentality, that line of thinking,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   where you put people down,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   where you judge them because of the job they have,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   the life that they've lived, the actions they've had,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   is a condemning, prideful, putting yourself in the position of God,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   who is the only one who is able to rightly judge other people.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Again, he's speaking about a condemning judgment of people in your life.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   It can look like, "Man, I think less of you because--
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Honestly, this happens in dating all the time,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   where it's like, "Man, this girl's damaged goods. Can't believe that."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Which is not the response of a godly man.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   In other words, I talk to girls all the time,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   they got a part of a past, or guys all the time, they have a past,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and they're like, "Man, you talk about godly people up on there on the stage,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and I'm telling you, they're not looking for someone like me
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   because I got a history of regret,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   dysfunctional relationships, sexual past."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I want to be abundantly clear.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   A godly guy is like Jesus,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   which means he doesn't hold sins of your past against you.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Sins, if you're not actively following and pursuing Jesus,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   those are concerns that he should rightly have.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   But if you're someone who's like, "Man, I've surrendered, I've gone all in with Jesus,"
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   if a godly guy doesn't see you like Jesus sees you,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   which is, I don't define you by your past,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   you're a godly guy, or a godly girl.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   But a person who speaks judgment and condemns based on the behavior
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   and thinks that I'm better with somebody
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   is the person James is talking about.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I mean, this candidly happens so often with Christians,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and it's so tragic where there's not a posture of like,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   "I'm going to extend the benefit of the doubt to you,"
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   or a humility to go, "Man, if I was in your shoes,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I bet I would struggle with the same thing."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   This can happen with same-sex attraction,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   where we can categorize these different sins that God doesn't categorize.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Where if you struggle with that, man, that's just,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   "Oh, I don't know what to even do with that."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   You have no idea what it's like to live in the life in the shoes of somebody else.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   None of us do.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   The number of people who I've met with down here at the front by the stage
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   that have had sexual abuse in their past,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   and that trickled into their life and began to have ripple effects in every direction.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And since that day, they've struggled with same-sex attraction.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   They've struggled with some sort of identity thing or identity issue.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And for you to look at somebody and say, "Man, I cannot believe that you do X,"
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and I'm not saying celebration or embracing sin at all.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I'm saying the way that we think about, we talk to people, we put people down,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   James would say, "It is pride."
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I was talking to a counselor one time, and I was talking about,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   honestly, pride in my own life of people that I was like,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   "Man, just this type of person that I'll leave out to work with,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   or my life, just kind of annoy me."
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And I was listing out some of the characteristics, and I don't even know what to do with that.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And he said, "The proper response to someone who has those behavioral characteristics,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   if it's like Jesus, should be compassion."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And I was like, "Yeah, I know. I need to grow in that."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And he said, "The way you grow in that is by being gripped by grace."
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And he said, "All those annoying characteristics of behavior things,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   and all the different things that different people in your life annoy you about,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   or that you're like, 'I can't believe that they would do that,'
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   or that we're prone to look down on, and 'I can't believe that she is X.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I can't believe that he's this way. I can't believe I will.'"
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Reflect the fact that I have forgotten the tail line that, but for God's grace,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I would be that same way.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Without God moving inside of my life, there's no reason that I wouldn't have the same struggles
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   or same challenges or same behavioral problems that other people have.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And the only reason I don't is because of God's grace, period.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   He said, "The more you can get gripped in that, the more that you,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   rather than being annoyed or repulsed, you feel compassion and patience and love
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and thankfulness to God, because there's nothing in your life that is good
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   that I can take responsibility for or credit for."
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   1 Corinthians 4 says this exact idea where it says, "Hey, what do you have that you did not receive?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?"
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   The poet would say, "Everything in your life, everything you think is great and awesome,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   it's because I really worked hard, all of that was a gift.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You can't take credit for the family you were born in.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   If you worked really hard and you got through college and you made it into grad school
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   or an Ivy League school, you don't have credit for that."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And you're like, "No, dude, I worked really hard."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Who gave you the strength to work really hard?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Who gave you the mind to work through and take exams and to do tests?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   There's no reason why you would have been given those types of opportunities.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   You can't take credit over your sexual history or sexual past,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   because maybe you're like, "Dude, I've dated, I've done everything right."
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You can't take credit for that.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Who placed in your life people that were a source of protection,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   maybe a father that came along and he was like, "Hey, sex is for marriage.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You're going to want to save this one."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Who was the person who provided a healthy family that some of you guys come from?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And when you think of it, you're like, "Man, people should just try harder."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You can't take credit for so many of the different things, the job that you have today.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's all a gift from a God who allowed you to, in an interview process,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   say the right things and have the right credentials to have that.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And James is saying the same way your whole life.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You shouldn't have a posture of any part of you that thinks, "I'm better than anyone,"
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   but a posture that says, "Anything that I have that is good is from God.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And anything that I see in other people's lives should drive me to prayer and patience
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and not speaking and putting other people down."
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And he would say, "Here's how you know you struggle with pride.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   If you put people down, you put others down with the words that you use."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   He continues and says another characteristic,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   the second way that you can know you might struggle with pride.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   "Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we'll go to this city or that city,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.'"
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   What is your life?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   You're a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   So James brings up plans.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Anybody, who's a planner in this room?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Like, man, I'm just planning. I got 2023 already on lock.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Anybody? Anybody not a planner in here?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Okay, and who, where's the planners again?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   There's like 25 planners. This world is falling apart.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   James brings up the subject of planning.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I would fall in the category of not loving plans.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   This is not my thing, but I am so thankful for planners.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Did James just throw shade at anybody who makes plans?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   No. He throws shade at the posture behind those plans.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Young adult years are just by nature, they are a time of a lot of planning,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   whether it's on a minor scale, and you got that calendar, you got triple calendars,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   or it's on a mega scale of like, here, I'm planning when I'm going to get married,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I'm planning the future that I have, I'm envisioning the financial future that I'm going to have,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and when I'm going to get out of debt, and home that I'm going to live in someday.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   My future, you know, influencer status that I'm working on and building my way up to,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   and my Etsy account over here. It's just a time of a lot of planning.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   James' point is not that plans are bad.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He's talking about the posture behind those plans.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And he brings up really two problems that are associated with the posture
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   that James says you and I are not to have.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So he brings up, you might struggle with plight, if you plan like you are in control.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   How do I know if I have a posture that plans like I'm in control,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and a posture that James would say is a prideful one?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Well, there's two problems that he brings up.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   The first is planning and living life as though I'm in control,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   which sets you up for a recipe of eventually discovering that all the plans and everything that I hope
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and all the things that I think I'm in control,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   eventually are going to collide with the direction that God's going to take life.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That contradicts mine.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And that can either lead me to react and trust in, or lean in,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   or to repel and move away from God.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   My four-year-old, five-year-old now, from time to time will go down to the school,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and that's down the block from our house, and we'll drive the golf cart.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I have this golf cart that's kind of a fixer-upper thing that we'll drive down there.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Let him sit on my lap. And it's the greatest thing ever when you're a five-year-old,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   because I'll let him sit and I'll let him drive.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And we'll be driving along, and he's turning it, and he's just like,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   "This is the greatest thing ever," because he's five.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And sometimes we'll be taking the trip down there,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and there's a car that's parked on the street, and he will be heading,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and he thinks it's funny to be like, "Oh, let's hit the car,"
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and it's like, "Not hitting the car. Daddy can't afford it."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And we will be confronted with the fact that he thinks he's in control,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   and he wants to go right, and his dad will take him left,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   or he doesn't know how to get home, and so he'll go right,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   and dad will take him left in order to get us home.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   God has a relationship with us.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   We're like a father. We're invited to sit on the lap of God and walk along,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and there will be times like he gives us decisions and options,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and you get to decide so much--not everything, but often your life
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and the decisions that you're making.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   There will still come times where all the plans and things--
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   this is where the future that I saw coming.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And you'll think we're going right, and God will take a left.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You think that relationship--that was a healthy relationship.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   They were a godly person. Maybe you met them at church,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   and you thought they were the one, and for whatever reason, God said,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   "No, we've got someone else."
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The job that you thought, like, "Man, this was it,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "and I feel like I've been stuck at the same position for three years.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "When am I ever going to get the promotion?"
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And that moment comes, and you think it's coming, and it doesn't.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   The grad school that you applied into that you were so hoping,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   like, "If I don't get into this one, I'm going to have to move cities,"
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and you didn't get in.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And in those moments when you're trying to go right,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and you see God's plan is clearly going left,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   the choice before all of us is to go, "Man, there's a God who's in control.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   "I can trust him. I can lean in.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   "If he's taking that direction, even though I didn't want to go that direction,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   "I can trust him, or I can do what a five-year-old does,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   "which is freak out and cry and be like, 'God, where are you?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   "'And you don't care about me.'"
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And I'm not trying to invalidate any of the pain and challenges
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   because it is terrible to break up with the person
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   that you thought you were going to move forward.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It is heartbreaking to not get the promotion or feel like you're stuck.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   But James would say, "You live in a world where you've never been in control.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   "And when God goes left and you want him to go right,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   "you can either trust him, or you can allow the fact
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   "that it's not going the way that you hoped it to, to push you away from God."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And he would say, "Hold on. You can trust him."
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   We'll talk about more of that in a second.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   The second problem of the person who plans,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   and the posture that James would say, "This is the type of planning
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   "that is really destructive," is that their plans are all about themselves.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   They're not about what God has, about God's will.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And he describes a person who's a go-getter.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Hey, this person comes up, says, "Today, tomorrow, we're going to the city.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   "We're going to make a profit. I'm going to start this business,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   "and it's going to be amazing."
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And their whole pursuit is all about their own purposes, their own plans.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   At the focal point of their plans is it's all about me,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   what I want, when I want it.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And James says, "It's the type of person whose end goal
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   "is their own satisfaction, their own happiness,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   "making more money in life, that when they think about,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   "'Hey, I think I should marry her because blank,'
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   "in that blank is not because God described the characteristics
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   "that I should look for in a wife, and she has them.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   "It is because she's hot."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And I'm all for it. Man, I hope you marry the hottest girl around,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   beautiful ladies around you. You should ask them out.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   But the point is, James is saying, they live a life where how they think,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   how they act, is not operated on like, "This is what God says I should do,"
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   but what they want to do.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Where they want to, "Hey, I think I should change jobs,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "not because God may be calling me, and I could live more on mission
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   "by taking that job. They think I should change jobs
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "because at the end of the day, it'll just allow me to make more money."
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   The focal point of how they decide, how they make plans, is themselves.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   If the end goal for you is to make money,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   you have a miserable destination ahead.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And you're going to spend your life, that James is about to describe,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   why it's a miserable destination ahead.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And you're going to waste it. Here's why.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   What is your life? You're a mist that appears for a little while,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   and then vanishes.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   The tragic thing for so many people inside of our country and in our world,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and for years, I mean, so many guys have parents that did this.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   They gave themselves to the world, and everything the world says to offer,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "Hey, the goal in life is to make as much money as possible,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   "to drive the G-Wagon, to get the Tesla someday,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   "get the biggest house that you can, and you're successful."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And they've succeeded at everything the world says is important,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and failed at everything the Bible says actually matters.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And you can spend the rest of your life
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   either giving your life to collecting little pieces of paper
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   with dead presidents on it.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   That's what money is.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Or you can give your life to the only thing that actually matters,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   and James would say, "Your life is like a vapor. You're really going to spend it
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "building up your own kingdom and your own life, and if you do, you are wasting it."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Or you can live your life and live for the will and the plans
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   of the one who's in control, the one who created you,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   who created you for a purpose far greater than a paper collection.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   But for him, and knowing him, and making him known.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I love the imagery that he uses.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Because James, he puts in a perspective, and he answers the question, "What is life?"
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And he answers it in several different ways.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   He says, "First thing, life is brief. It's like a vapor."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   What is a vapor? Vapor.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   That's what James describes in his life.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   He's like, "Oh, oh, oh, you're gone. Boom. Oh."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He's like, "Oh, birth, elementary school, college, oh, no,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   high school, college, we got retired, married, married, lots of, no, okay."
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And he says, "It's here and gone."
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   The Bible uses that illustration.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Sorry, man, that's hairspray all over you guys down there.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Over and over, this is the imagery that God uses.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And James says, "You need to know. You have no idea what's ahead of tomorrow.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   You're not promised anything.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Who are you going to live your life for?"
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Let me ask a question.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Who would consider themselves young in here?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   There's like four people over 50 that are like, "Oh, no, they found us."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I'm kidding. Totally kidding.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   All right, I'm getting an email for that.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I mean, I'm sure all of us would.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   You're like, "Hey, it's a young adult. Is this a trick question?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It's a young adult ministry?"
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Well, being young is kind of a relative thing.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   In other words, like when you're 14, a 28-year-old is like, "Oh, you're so old."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   When you're 28, a 40-year-old is like, "Man, you're old."
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   When you're 40 or when you're 80, a 40-year-old is young.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   There's relativity to it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But it's not just that.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Young being like, "Man, I'm early on in life," is a relative thing based on when the end is.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   In other words, if you're 30 and you're going to die at 32, you're in the later part of your life.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   You're near the end.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   You're a lot farther along than the person who's 40 who's going to die at 80, who's just halfway.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Who knows the end date?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   God.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   James is saying, "You don't know what.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   You think you're young? You think you're invincible?"
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Let's be honest, all of us do.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   You don't know what anything holds.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   You don't know when God's calling you home.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   How much longer are you going to live for yourself and go, "Someday.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Someday I'll get serious about God.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Whenever I meet the person and we get the one, then I'll get serious about God.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Then I'll start going back to church and trying to get things back in order.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   But right now, I'm just trying to enjoy my 20s, trying to live my life."
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   He says, "You don't know if you'll have any more 20s.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   You don't know how long your life will be.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   You don't know how many more days that you have.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And you're going to spend that little vapor that you have
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   and another moment of that vapor on yourself and waste it?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Are you going to give it to the only kingdom that matters
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   and surrender your life and use the gifts and the talents and treasures
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   that the world around you wants to take and take advantage of
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   to make money and to make rich people richer
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and to collect more papers with green--
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   or more green pieces of paper with dead presidents on it?"
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And God is saying, "All of that is like a vapor.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Don't be a fool.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   You don't know what tomorrow has.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   You don't know what's ahead for you.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You know the one who holds tomorrow, and you can either live for him
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   or you can waste it."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   James is saying, "When it comes to your life,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   the person who makes plans or who lives as though they're in control is a fool."
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   He finally concludes by laying out what you prioritize.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   He says this in verse 15.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   "You ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   we will live and do this or that.'
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   All such boasting is evil.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   If anyone then knows the good that they ought to do and doesn't do it,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   for them it is sin."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   So he brings up the third idea, which is you might struggle with pride
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   if you are the priority, if your priorities are your priority.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   That would be another way of saying it.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   But he brings up--and he brings a verse that just kind of feels random when you read it,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   but when you think about it, it makes sense.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   He says, "If anyone knows the good that they ought to do today
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and they don't do it, it's sin."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Why would someone know the good, know what they ought to do,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   know that God is calling them to some decision,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   some action to take, some relationship to break off,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   some conversation to have with a parent,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   something they're supposed to do at work,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   something they're supposed to confess to their community?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Why would someone do it?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Or why would someone decide, "I know what I'm supposed to do.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I'm not doing it."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Well, it's probably a question you haven't thought about before,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   but it's a pretty simple answer.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   They don't want to.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Clearly know what I'm supposed to?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Not going to do that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And James says that you might know that you're prideful
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   if you and your priorities are your priority.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Your life, your decisions, you live according to what you prioritize,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   not what God prioritizes, but what you prioritize.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Your priority is you and doing what you want as it relates to dating,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   working, giving, spending, living.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Let me ask a really important question.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   When is the last time you did something?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Listen to me.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   When is the last time that you did something you did not want to do,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   but you did because God said to?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Or a time where you wanted to do something,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   but you didn't do it because God said not to?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Might I suggest if you can't think of a time in your life where you're like,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "Man, I didn't want to do that, but it's what God says.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   This is what I'm going to do."
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Your God is not the God who's there.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   It's you.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   The Bible over and over says there can be times where, man,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   God says this is what you do,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   but people who worship him as God and are surrendered to him,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   they say, "Man, you drive the car.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   You're in control."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Is there a time where you can think of like, "Man, I was at work.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I didn't want to have this conversation about Jesus because it's just awkward,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and I don't know how I'm going to get there, but I'm a co-worker,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   and I just felt like I was supposed to, and I did it."
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Is there a time that you can think of where maybe you're like,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   "Man, I feel like I'm so busy right now.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I don't have time to get plugged into a church.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I don't know that there even is a church that I'm totally set on,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   and I don't know if I want to, but I did it because God says to."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Hebrews 13 says, "Submit to elders that you and I are to be a part of a local church and members."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Can you think of times, moments in your life
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   where despite the fact that you didn't want to, you did,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   or that you did want to, you didn't because God said to?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   If you can't, that's confusing.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And if you're not a believer, you're not a Christian, that makes total sense.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   But if you claim to be a follower of Jesus, and there aren't any times you can go like,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   "Man, this is what I wanted," but it wasn't what God said to do.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Maybe it's in a dating relationship where you're like, "You know,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   everything inside of me is like, 'Woo! I want to push this forward,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   and man, this girl. Woo! Man!'
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   My Bible's telling me no, but my body is telling me!"
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   What if I just go? I'm like, "Tell me, yeah!"
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It becomes a concert, and like, "Pastor?"
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Man, I lost my total train of thought.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Where everything inside of you was like, "Mm! Man, I--oof!"
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   But the Bible has made it very clear God does not want this.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   If you're not living out that tension, I don't know that you're following Jesus.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Because all the time, Jesus is in Luke chapter 9, "Pick up your cross.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Whoever wants to be my disciple," and he uses an execution analogy,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "must pick up the gas chamber, must pick up their cross, and die daily, and follow me."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And James says, "Man, if the priority--if your life is marked by doing your priorities,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   God is not your priority.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And you might know you struggle with pride if you are your priority."
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   James is saying over and over in this book that this new relationship,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   that these new Christians have, should impact everything.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And so I was thinking about it this week.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It's like, relational proximity should determine priority.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   In other words, we're talking about priority and living God's priorities,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   come as a Christian.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   This new relationship that I have with God and with Jesus
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   should impact and mark how I live all of my life.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   When it comes to relationships, every relationship you have impacts your life.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   But the closer your relationship is, the more it impacts your life.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Another way of saying it is the closer, the more proximity a relationship has,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   the more priority it has in how you decide, how you live, the more impact it has.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   An example, my wife, we got married.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   We've been married 8 1/2 years, and that relationship is incredibly close,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   closest one I have on earth.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   That proximity determines priority.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Because she's my wife and has incredible proximity,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   it determines the priority and way that I act and way that I think of
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and way that I act on her behalf or for her.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   In other words, when it comes to her birthday, that proximity leads to priority.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   So we have birthday. We have birthday not just day.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   We got birthday week because that's how she rolls.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And we celebrate because there's proximity determines priority.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I have a relationship with my barista.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Don't know her that well, go in, get a cup of coffee, head on my way,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   hey, thanks for the interview.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   There's a relationship, but the proximity is far greater.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   So when it comes to her birthday, I don't even know when it is.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   I would say happy birthday if I saw her,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   but there's not a proximity that determines priority.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   If in your life God is not a priority and God's priorities are not your priorities,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   they're not even on your radar, might I suggest there's not proximity.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Closest, it's there.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And God's not angry at you. He's in love with you.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He gave his life on the cross for you. He died for you.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   He wants you to experience life more than you do.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   He wants a better future for you than you do.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   But without proximity, of course it will not be a priority.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And James says this new relationship with God, it should impact all the ways that you think,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   the way that you plan.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   This is what I'm hoping to do in 2021, God, but is that what you would have me do?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   As I think through who I'm going to live and how I'm going to date and even this person,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   is this who God would have me date?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   If I'm thinking about changing jobs, am I even considering, is this what God would want?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Or am I just directing and driving my life, giving him updates every now and then?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   He's basically a 911 call.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   He's not really involved. He's like the 911 police or firefighter that,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   "Hey, you don't call me. I'll call you when I need you."
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   The Bible says that's not a relationship at all.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   God wants a relationship, a relationship that the more you and I walk in proximity,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   his priorities become our priorities and priorities that God has for us,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   they lead to life in every different arena.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And James says, "It is prideful to think that you know better how to live the vapor of your life."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And you and I have a decision every day.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Am I going to surrender it and trust him and rearrange my priorities with his?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Because at the end of the day, God's not saying, "Hey, you shouldn't care about anything."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   He's saying, "When it comes to what is first, a first priority,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   seek first my kingdom, my righteousness, everything else will be added."
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   So the application for tonight is to rearrange priorities.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I don't know what your priority is, but when it comes to thinking through,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   at work, my priority is to be successful and do what I just want to slay.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Is that God's priority? God's priority for me is to be a light.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Matthew 5, 14 says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   He places lamps in specific locations to light up.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   You live in a dark office where nobody else knows Jesus.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   That's amazing. God put you there.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   As it relates to your dating relationship, or maybe just life in general,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   your priority, I want to get married, I want to have seven kids,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I want to live in his house, I want to have all these different dreams.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Is that God's priority? I don't know.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I know that his ultimate priority for all of us is to love him, to know him,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   to make him known to other people.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   It's not a bad thing to be married and have seven kids.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I hope you do.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Great, let's have seven kids. It's awesome.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   But is that the priority? No, at the end of the day, it's not ultimate.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   God says, "Do not put as first priority anything other than my kingdom."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And the good news is, it's Matthew 6, verse 33.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   You do that, I'm going to take care of the rest.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   So I was thinking about this week and this message as we conclude.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   The Scriptures, they lay out something that was so sobering to me this week.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   They talk about life in a way that is hard for my heart and mind to get around.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And I don't know that I ever will.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   But this life is so short and then eternity, forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's like this rope, this rope represents eternity.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Creation of the world, time begins, everything created.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Thousands of years go by and someone named Jesus entered into the cosmos.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   The one who created it puts on flesh and skin and he enters into it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And Christians believe, maybe you're not a Christian, this will be helpful for you.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   This is the message of Christianity.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   That God in the form of Jesus came to earth.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   He lived, no one denies that.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   He died, no one denies that.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But then he rose again.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He came back to life.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And he claimed, and those who followed him closely, like James, claimed,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   anyone who believes in Jesus, accepts Jesus as the payment for their sin on the cross,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   will have eternal life.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   In other words, they don't put their faith in themselves.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   If I was to come down or you came down front, we had a conversation,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   and I asked you on a scale of one to ten, how confident are you that you are going to spend eternity with God?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Ten being totally confident.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   One, not at all confident.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And you, this happens every week, this conversation.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And people come down, ask that question, and I'm like, well, I'm like a six.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I'm like, awesome, that's a six.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Why are you a six?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Sentence that comes next, almost always the same.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Starts with a single word.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   I, well, I'm trying to get my life in order.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   I love being back at church, but I've just done some bad things,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   but I'm trying to get my life together.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Or they'll have a nine, and they're like, well, I follow God, I've done what he says,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I've saved myself from marriage, I know a lot of Bible verses.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Both of those answers, incorrect.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Eternity teaches that a person can know they have 100% confidence I will spend eternity with God in heaven,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   not because I anything.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Because Jesus, what he did on the cross, paying for my sin, rising from the grave, he paid it.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   I got one reason, one reason only.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   No matter how good of a person I think I am, how bad I am, none of that matters.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Because the Bible says all of us are worse than we even understand.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   But if you by faith say, man, I received Jesus, you died in my place.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And you rose from the grave.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   You're going to live forever and ever and ever for all of eternity.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   For the rest of the rest of the rest.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   So that happened, and then 2,000 years go by, and then there's you.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And in the scope of eternity, because this rope goes on and on and on, it goes way off the stage.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   It goes on, just imagine, forever and ever and ever.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   And in that eternity, you've got this short little life of a vapor.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   And the Bible says that anyone who believes in their short little life of a vapor,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   in what Jesus did on the cross, they're going to spend all of that eternity with God, forever and ever and ever.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And not just that.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Anyone who uses their short little time period, where we get so focused,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   where we think everything in this life is like, oh, my gosh, I can't believe that I didn't do this,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   and I'm not married yet, and I'm so disappointed in this, and we get so narrowed in,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   and the Bible has this picture of billions and billions of years where you're going to spend eternity with God,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and anything that you do in this life for God and his kingdom will have ripple effects for the rest of the rest of the rest.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   There's a famous line that he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to get that which he cannot lose.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   That anything you invest, Jesus says, for my kingdom will be something for all of eternity and eternity.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And anything that you invest for your kingdom will just be an opportunity missed for all of eternity and eternity and eternity.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And he says to you, who are you going to live for?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Whose kingdom are you going to live for?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Are you willing to surrender, come underneath of God, and humble yourselves,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   and rearrange those priorities, and trust in him in the short time period that he has?
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   I don't know how long God has for you. This week, I talked to a friend.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I was in my office, and a co-worker came in, and they were like, I got to go to Austin.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   A friend of mine just passed away, and they rushed down. Young 20s.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Way earlier than anybody thought.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I hope God gives you many, many years with him, and that you fill those many, many years,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   and even if they're 70 or 80 in the glimpse of eternity, they're even smaller than this,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   and that you fill those with walking, and trusting in him.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   James would say, if you do that, you will have invested it, and if not, you will have wasted it.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Let me pray.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Father, thank you that firsthand, you've given us an account from the brother of the Son of God,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   the half-brother who saw his brother die and come back alive,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   who experienced change and transformation in his own life when he surrendered his life to him.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I pray for anyone who tonight has never had a moment where they put their faith in Jesus.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Tonight would be their night, and they would trust in him. They would walk with him all their days.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Pray for parts of our heart, God, that are many and my own, that are filled with pride or selfishness,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   that you would mercifully expose those areas.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Bend my heart more in your direction. Make us more focused on you and your kingdom,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   and would you help us to walk surrendered, to walk with you,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   to not give our lives to something that's so fleeting, and the voice and the messages of the world is so loud.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.400]   Would you help us?
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   We worship you now in song.
