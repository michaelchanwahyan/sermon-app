1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:26,640
 - What's up, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,840
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,920
 So good to be with you, great to worship with you guys.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,420
 Welcome, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,920
 people around the world tuning in via podcast or stream.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,440
 We're so glad you are with us,

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,060
 gathering with us in your communities

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,800
 and with your friends and neighbors and whatnot.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,160
 So great to be here.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,000
 It's going to be a fun night

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,920
 of just diving into the scriptures.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,280
 Recently, I told you the last few weeks

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,560
 that my family and I just got back from vacation.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,460
 We went with a couple families with kids and whatnot.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,260
 And one of them was Shaney who leads worships

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,120
 here most nights.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
 And he had these walkie talkies.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,840
 So we went to the beach

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,640
 and he brought these walkie talkies with him.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,040
 And I just thought that was a great idea

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,100
 because when you're like, our kids were in run room

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,720
 and we were in another one.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,840
 And so you kind of got just like, hey, what do you do

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
 if somebody wakes up in the middle of night or something?

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,960
 And I just thought the walkie talkies were a great idea.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,600
 And so I went home, got on Amazon Prime, made it happen,

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 got some walkie talkies.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,920
 And so there's these, I saw specifically these kind

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,480
 that had a 24 mile range, 24 mile range.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,780
 I'm like, this is gonna be amazing.

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,840
 'Cause I've got a three year old son, Weston,

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,000
 and we can just like have fun.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,160
 Like I'll be at work, Weston, you know, 10-4, are you there?

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,120
 Anybody got their ears on?

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
 Kind of thing, it's gonna be amazing.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,620
 And so, I'm thinking about all of the possibilities

38
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,460
 with these walkie talkies.

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,600
 My other buddy, he lives a couple miles away.

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,120
 He has a three year old son too.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,380
 I'm like, hey, they're gonna be buddies.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,820
 You know, like the old school,

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,680
 remember like the tin can with the string?

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,640
 Well, now in 2016, it's walkie talkies.

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,440
 And so, they're gonna be able to talk and you know,

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,200
 just have fun, it's gonna be great.

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
 And so these walkie talkies come in,

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,920
 and I'm thinking like, I'm gonna be at work,

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,800
 like sitting at my desk.

50
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,720
 Hey, Weston, you there?

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
 And so I did that, it didn't work.

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,760
 And so I go home, I get the box, I'm looking at it,

53
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,540
 and I see there's three pictures.

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,540
 The first picture are two boats on the ocean, open ocean.

55
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,640
 And it says 24 mile range, like two boats, unobstructed.

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,480
 The next picture are two people in a forest.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,040
 There's trees, and it says one mile range.

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 And then the next picture are people in the city,

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
 and like buildings and walls and whatnot,

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,960
 and it's like one block range.

61
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
 And I'm like, oh, burn, man, false advertising.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
 What's up with that?

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
 And as I think about that,

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
 and where we're headed this evening,

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
 I think about just like all of the noise

66
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,080
 and the distractions and all the things

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,240
 that want to come between us and Christ in 2016.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,000
 The emails and the text messages and the social media

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
 and the relationships and the news and the killings

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 and the craziness and the chaos,

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,960
 and yet we're supposed to sit still with Christ,

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,400
 but there's all of these things, all of this noise,

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,900
 all of these structures that wanna come between us.

74
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,180
 And so the closer, the closer we must be,

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,080
 the closer we must be to him

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,120
 so that we can commune with him and talk with him

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,760
 and have a relationship with him,

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,240
 because in those three pictures, we're all the third one.

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 We are all in the city, if you will.

80
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,240
 We are all the people separated by lots of noise

81
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,360
 and structure and chaos.

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
 And so we're moving through a series called AD.

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,440
 AD stands for Anno Domini,

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,560
 which is Latin for the year of the Lord.

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,000
 It started as the year of the Lord Jesus Christ,

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
 shortened to the year of the Lord,

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
 you have BC before Christ, AD,

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,200
 that 2016 years ago, God became a man

89
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,560
 in the form of Jesus Christ,

90
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,760
 and the calendar started counting from zero,

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,240
 that every atheist you know acknowledges Jesus

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,160
 by the date they put on their checks.

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,840
 How crazy is this?

94
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,160
 And so we gather tonight here at the porch in his name,

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,640
 and this evening, we're talking about

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
 distractions from Jesus,

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,360
 what pulls you away from time with Jesus.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,260
 And for me, I'll just tell you, it's technology.

99
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,780
 Like, it's my iPhone, it's the noise of emails,

100
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,160
 it's the clutter of the chaos that continues to creep in

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,640
 and fight for my attention.

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,200
 There always seems like there is so much other things

103
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,660
 that I can be doing that studying the scriptures

104
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,480
 and sitting with Christ just seems impractical.

105
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,780
 It rarely seems like the smartest option, the best option.

106
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,120
 We need this text this evening, porch.

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,880
 I'd love for you to do something right now, if you would.

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,160
 I'd love for every single person in the room

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
 to pull out their phone and hold it up high.

110
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
 Like, grab your phone, your device, your smartphone,

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,480
 your walkie-talkie if you brought one,

112
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,560
 and hold it up in the air.

113
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
 I see you, I see you.

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,960
 Hold it up high, hold it up.

115
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 Here's what I, I didn't bring it, I put it away.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
 What I'd love for you to do,

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,880
 here's what, what am I gonna ask you to do?

118
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,600
 I'm gonna ask you to turn it off.

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
 I want you to turn it, now here's what just happened,

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
 here's what just happened.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,680
 You began to think about all the reasons you can't,

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,600
 I gotta take notes on it.

123
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
 What about my Bible?

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
 What about my mom, she's gonna text me when she's here

125
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,120
 to pick me up.

126
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,440
 All of these reasons that you,

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
 what, my friends aren't here,

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
 they're gonna tell 'em where I'm sitting.

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,240
 What about the picture?

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,280
 What about the, what about social media?

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,440
 You want me tweetin', right, JP?

132
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,920
 What about this hashtag?

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,000
 Turn it off.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,680
 Turn it off.

135
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,080
 The world is gonna go on without you.

136
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,520
 Hold that button, slide that finger across that screen,

137
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
 and your excuse is not good enough.

138
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
 Turn it off.

139
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
 And here's why.

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
 Houston, Fort Worth, I hope you held up your phone,

141
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
 I hope you're turning it off right now.

142
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
 We gotta hear this message.

143
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,320
 I don't want anything to distract you

144
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,800
 from consuming the word of God this evening.

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,200
 And so as we move through this text in Luke chapter 10,

146
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,360
 I'm going to look at three questions.

147
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,080
 Two are about distractions, and the last question

148
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,960
 is about what marks our lives.

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
 Is it distractions or devotion?

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
 And so I'll tell you the story on the front

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
 and picture this.

152
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,120
 Jesus approaches a town called Bethany.

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,040
 It's one and a half miles east of Jerusalem

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,560
 as he moves towards the holy city, if you will,

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
 and he's invited into Martha's home.

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,040
 And so Martha is busy getting everything ready for dinner.

157
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
 She's making preparations, the scripture says,

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
 and her sister Mary is sitting at Jesus' feet,

159
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
 which is a controversial move

160
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,980
 because this is a place of disciples,

161
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,800
 not something women would have done in this time,

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
 but Jesus receives her and he's teaching her,

163
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,920
 and Martha comes to Mary and to Jesus and says,

164
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,440
 whines to Jesus, "Jesus, Lord, she's not helping.

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,360
 "Will you ask her to help me?"

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,760
 She implores Jesus to come to her side,

167
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,140
 and Jesus speaks up and gently rebukes her,

168
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,320
 saying that your sister Mary has done the better thing.

169
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,560
 Now, I don't know if you have siblings

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,680
 or have ever seen sibling rivalry,

171
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,860
 but this is crazy if a child comes and says,

172
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,960
 "Hey, Mommy, don't you understand?

173
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,120
 "Finley is," Presley, Finley's doing what is right.

174
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,720
 Oh, it feels, ah.

175
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,880
 There's a heaviness to that.

176
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,280
 There's a difficulty there.

177
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,660
 And so I know this family

178
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,040
 because this is similar to my family.

179
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,000
 There's three siblings.

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
 There's Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.

181
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,320
 This is classic birth order, if you will.

182
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,480
 Martha, the oldest, is getting after it.

183
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,120
 She's the rule follower,

184
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,320
 and Mary likes to color outside the lines, if you will.

185
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,400
 She's sitting at Christ's feet.

186
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
 And so these are Jesus's friends.

187
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
 They show up in the scripture three times.

188
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
 They show up here at this mealtime,

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,920
 another time when Lazarus dies

190
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,720
 and Jesus brings him back to life,

191
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,120
 and then another time when they're dining yet again,

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,600
 and Mary anoints Jesus's feet

193
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 with the famous perfume, the alabaster jar.

194
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,220
 And so we'll dive into that,

195
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,080
 but let me start here in Luke chapter 10, verse 38.

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,520
 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way,

197
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
 he came to a village

198
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,200
 where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.

199
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,840
 She had a sister called Mary,

200
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,320
 who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,140
 And then it says this,

202
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,800
 "But Martha was distracted by all the preparations

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,720
 "that had to be made."

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,600
 And so while Mary's learning at Jesus's feet,

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,760
 it says that Martha is distracted by her to-do list,

206
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,040
 all the things that she has to do.

207
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
 There's this dichotomy in the room.

208
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,020
 There's Mary's and there's Martha's, okay?

209
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,080
 And you already know which one you are.

210
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,940
 I don't need to heap further judgment on you.

211
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,560
 You've already probably self-identified at this point,

212
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
 or at least you've identified your roommate

213
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,980
 or what your mother is.

214
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,080
 And so my first question tonight is,

215
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,040
 what are the distractions that pull you away from Jesus?

216
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,100
 You need to know this.

217
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,000
 What are the distractions today

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,280
 that pull you away from Jesus?

219
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,080
 We don't know exactly what Martha was distracted by,

220
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,920
 but it wasn't sinful things.

221
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,120
 Like she's not in the other room looking at porn.

222
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,400
 She's not in the other room taking shots at Patron.

223
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,480
 She's not getting wasted,

224
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
 getting thrown in the other room,

225
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,480
 hitting the bong, if you will.

226
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,680
 Like she's doing something good.

227
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,060
 She's doing something, what she perceives as righteous.

228
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,540
 She's getting things ready

229
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,880
 for whoever's going to come over.

230
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,120
 She's making standard preparations.

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,880
 She's not on Instagram, #JesusIsInMyLivingRoom.

232
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
 No, she's not doing any of that.

233
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,120
 Like she's getting after it.

234
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,240
 She's doing good things.

235
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,240
 Good things can distract you from Christ.

236
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,280
 And Jesus would prefer her to be with him

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,640
 rather than work for him.

238
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,640
 Are you more inclined to do things for Jesus, F-O-R,

239
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,800
 or with Jesus?

240
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,860
 And here we see his preference for followers of Christ.

241
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,960
 Those who profess to be Christians.

242
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,760
 Christ shows his cards here in this text.

243
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,300
 He says, "I'd rather you do things with me.

244
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,000
 "I'd rather you sit with me."

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,280
 This text has been beating me up

246
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
 for the last week and a half,

247
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,100
 just thinking that we are not contemplative enough,

248
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,160
 that we are not still enough.

249
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,400
 I am confident that Christ followers in 2016

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,520
 have not embraced enough the discipline

251
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,840
 of being still and listening to God.

252
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,400
 Now, I don't know if you did that today.

253
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,700
 I don't know if that was a part of your life,

254
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,280
 but I'm confident that it needs to be.

255
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,760
 My hunch is that what Martha's doing here,

256
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,040
 like what she's motivated by,

257
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
 is kind of the approval of others.

258
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
 It looks like service.

259
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
 Hear me out, if you will.

260
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,920
 It looks like she's doing good things.

261
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
 It looks like she just wants to care for those around her

262
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,360
 that her motive is caring,

263
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
 but in reality, I think,

264
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,340
 as I studied this text for over a week now,

265
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,800
 I think it's actually more a concern

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,640
 of what others will think.

267
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,720
 I want them to think that my house is clean,

268
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,900
 that I have it in order,

269
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,320
 and that I'm a good cook.

270
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,700
 She's driven by, I believe,

271
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,640
 the approval of others,

272
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,560
 and that has led her to be stressed out and anxious.

273
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
 I'll tell you that no one is busier

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,840
 than someone trying to manage the perception of others.

275
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,800
 No one is busier than someone

276
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,080
 trying to manage the perception of others.

277
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,560
 If you want people to think you are important,

278
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,400
 you're going to wear yourself out

279
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,360
 trying to manage that perception.

280
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,520
 And so here is what I want to give you

281
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
 to help you overcome that.

282
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,560
 A death grip on this reality, this truth right now.

283
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,400
 God is in charge of what others think of you.

284
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,680
 That right in the other room,

285
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,540
 as Martha is getting after it,

286
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,880
 the one who is sovereign over the opinions of everyone

287
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,120
 is sitting right there with her sister.

288
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,880
 God is in charge of what your boss thinks of you,

289
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
 what she thinks of you,

290
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,960
 what he thinks of you,

291
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,040
 what your friends think of you.

292
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,160
 God is in charge.

293
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 He's sovereign over the opinions of others.

294
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,520
 This should set us free from this.

295
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,160
 But Martha is distracted.

296
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,800
 The etymology, the root of that,

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,280
 or the origin of that word, distracted here,

298
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,120
 it means to be pulled away from.

299
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,100
 So it's like you're headed towards something

300
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,820
 and you're pulled off track.

301
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,120
 You're pulled away from it.

302
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,440
 At the lake this weekend,

303
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
 went to the lake with my family,

304
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,480
 did the whole stand up paddle board thing,

305
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,020
 which is quite humorous

306
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,200
 because I'm a lot of weight in just like one central area

307
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,320
 and I just don't do well with these stand up paddle boards.

308
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,680
 Like wakeboard, skateboards, all good.

309
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,980
 Stand up paddle boards, my just nemesis, if you will.

310
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,620
 And so there I am trying to balance on this thing,

311
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,240
 not doing well, keep falling off, I hate them.

312
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,400
 And so there's this leash though

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,840
 that kind of keeps it close to you, which is helpful.

314
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,320
 But I noticed something that as I put the leash on,

315
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,680
 this strap, if you will, there's Velcro there.

316
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,640
 And so I put it on

317
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,040
 and it doesn't really hold together well

318
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,920
 because it's soggy and muddy

319
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,800
 and there's leaf particles in there

320
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,280
 and fuzzies and all this stuff.

321
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,860
 And so like that the Velcro sticks together

322
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,560
 is kind of just a suggestion.

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,040
 It's kind of like only the moisture of the water

324
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,880
 that's holding these two straps together.

325
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 And as I thought about that and I looked at that,

326
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,040
 it's all the things in between the Velcro

327
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,820
 that's preventing it to stick together

328
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,200
 or to stay together as it should be.

329
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,700
 And therefore it's easy to pull it away.

330
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,920
 And I thought about our relationship with Christ

331
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,680
 that as we should stay clinging to him,

332
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,120
 that we should stay stuck to him,

333
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,280
 maintaining a relationship with him,

334
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
 maintaining communication with him,

335
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,320
 that there's all these things that have come between us

336
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,400
 making it easy for us to be pulled away

337
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,560
 like Martha is here in this text.

338
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,320
 And so I don't know what it is,

339
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,260
 what are the preparations for you, for me,

340
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,120
 I'll just show you, like here's a picture

341
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,220
 of this is my literal phone.

342
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,360
 And so for me it's social media,

343
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
 it's where I'm going,

344
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,440
 it's entertainment,

345
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,000
 it's even the porch can pull me away

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
 like the things that I have to do,

347
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,040
 good things that are my responsibilities,

348
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
 my work if you will.

349
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,760
 Emails, that's right, 23,965 unread ones.

350
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,920
 So if you're wondering why I haven't emailed you back,

351
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,040
 there you go, you're not alone.

352
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,840
 Messages, text messages,

353
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,020
 Twitter, and that's right, Craigslist.

354
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,080
 Like as I think about, this is crazy,

355
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,780
 true confessions, as I think about

356
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,200
 what has pulled me away from Christ most this past week,

357
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,220
 this is just me being vulnerable with you right now.

358
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,280
 It's the fact that I want a golf cart.

359
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,300
 And I catch myself, true story,

360
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,700
 I catch myself reading the Bible

361
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,580
 and finishing and going on Craigslist

362
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,460
 and looking at golf carts.

363
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,980
 And there's like this excitement,

364
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,660
 this materialistic hole in my heart

365
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,400
 that is more excited about the thought or idea

366
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,680
 of buying a golf cart, I don't even golf.

367
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,420
 True story, play golf I think I should say,

368
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,580
 I don't even play golf.

369
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,740
 I'm more excited about that idea

370
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,020
 than sitting with God the creator of the heavens and the earth

371
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
 the one who literally died for my sins

372
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,940
 and rose from the dead

373
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,740
 and the one who I'm gonna spend eternity with.

374
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,780
 What's wrong with me?

375
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,580
 Wretched man am I.

376
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,900
 And so I don't know if you ever feel

377
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,500
 like you don't have enough time.

378
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,740
 I've been saying something for years now,

379
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,960
 I don't intend to stop but it always makes people angry.

380
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,360
 And you gotta hear me,

381
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,720
 you will never have more time than you do right now.

382
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,360
 And I'll tell you I've married people off,

383
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,780
 there are folks that have been in the porch

384
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,700
 that have four kids now.

385
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,000
 And every single one of them have come back to me

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,760
 and said, JP man that was so true.

387
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,000
 When you said I didn't believe it when you said it.

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,880
 But man that was true.

389
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,040
 Like quiet time just feels like a thing of the past.

390
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,240
 Once when I could just go in my closet,

391
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
 just get away from my roommate

392
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,320
 and I could spend time with Christ.

393
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,380
 Now I have to geographically move locations.

394
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,960
 I have to find a forest,

395
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,200
 some place where my children can't find me

396
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,240
 so that I can sit quietly with Jesus.

397
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,440
 That quiet thing, it is like this elusive unicorn

398
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
 that I've gotta find, okay.

399
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,720
 It is very difficult to get that.

400
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,400
 You will never in your life have more time

401
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,520
 than you do right now.

402
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,720
 Period, done, fact.

403
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,640
 Absolute truth.

404
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
 And here's what that means.

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,620
 You will probably at no time in the future

406
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,300
 spend more time with Jesus than you did today.

407
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,900
 So I don't know what it looked like for you today.

408
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,280
 But if you have some grand hope,

409
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
 some grand scheme or plan that one day

410
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,440
 I'm gonna have four children, a German shepherd,

411
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,320
 a white picket fence and a spouse in the suburbs

412
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,700
 and an hour quiet time every day.

413
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,880
 But today I'm busy.

414
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
 You are sadly mistaken.

415
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,400
 You are fooling yourself.

416
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,600
 You have believed a lie.

417
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,340
 The enemy is at work.

418
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,520
 And I just wanna set you straight.

419
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,960
 And so Martha is distracted from spending time with Jesus.

420
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,600
 And the reality of it is that she has the luxury of him,

421
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,480
 the physical incarnate God, being right in the other room.

422
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,040
 But so do you.

423
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,600
 And Jesus is right in the other room waiting on you

424
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,400
 in a quiet space saying, hey, come spend time with me.

425
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
 Come sit at my feet.

426
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
 How do you spend time with him?

427
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,920
 That's the question.

428
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,000
 How do you spend time with Jesus?

429
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
 How do you connect with him?

430
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
 And all followers of Christ have to have a death grip

431
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
 on the answer to this question.

432
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,580
 This should be a question that you can answer like,

433
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,920
 what color is the sky?

434
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,760
 How tall am I?

435
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,580
 What's my name?

436
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,920
 What's my address?

437
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
 Speaking for yourself.

438
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,800
 You should be able to answer this question,

439
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,040
 how do you spend time with Christ?

440
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,920
 How do you connect with him?

441
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,320
 As easy as those questions.

442
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,580
 And you've gotta find out what it is for you.

443
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,760
 For me, it's things like walking in nature,

444
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,320
 walking, getting so lost in nature

445
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,560
 that it's gonna take me time to get back to my truck

446
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,440
 or technology of any kinds that I find myself

447
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,720
 in a place surrounded by leaves and streams

448
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
 and birds, if you will.

449
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,320
 And I have to sit still and be with God.

450
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,220
 For me, this is funny, don't picture it,

451
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,480
 but taking baths, okay?

452
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,920
 I know, I know.

453
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,640
 Taking baths are a time where I can connect with God.

454
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,880
 And lastly, something else that's kind of silly

455
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,600
 is faith-based films.

456
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,440
 I don't know why.

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
 I mean, it's not for the acting,

458
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,560
 but there's something about faith-based films

459
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,600
 that stir my affections for Christ.

460
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,120
 I think what it is with all three of those things,

461
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
 as I'm just honest with you,

462
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,000
 I think that I'm putting myself in situations

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,660
 that are difficult to get out of.

464
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,800
 All three of those situations

465
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,700
 are situations away from technology, if you will.

466
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,660
 You can't be in a movie just texting and checking email.

467
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,240
 You can sit there.

468
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,440
 I can be in nature, connecting with God,

469
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,400
 away from technology, and in a bathtub.

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,440
 I don't wanna be electrocuted.

471
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,020
 So therefore, all of those things

472
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,320
 are just places where I'm forced to be still.

473
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
 What is it for you?

474
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,760
 You need to know what it is for you.

475
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,680
 'Cause if I told you, I'm like,

476
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,220
 "Here's what I want you to do today, all right?

477
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,800
 "I want you to take a walk through a forest,

478
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,880
 "take a bath, and watch Fireproof,"

479
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,040
 you're gonna be like, "No.

480
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,740
 "No, I should've went War Room, I guess."

481
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,140
 She came to him, this Martha, comes to Jesus and asks,

482
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,180
 "Lord, don't you care that my sister

483
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,720
 "has left me to do the work by myself?

484
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,440
 "Tell her to help me!"

485
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,800
 Martha, Martha.

486
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 Whenever you see that, two names repeated,

487
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
 it happens throughout the scripture.

488
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,800
 It's a term of endearment.

489
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,120
 It's a term of deep, deep compassion.

490
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,600
 It's not satirical here.

491
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,440
 It's not satire or sarcasm.

492
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,280
 He's moving toward her, and he shows deep compassion for her.

493
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,060
 Martha, Martha, the Lord answered.

494
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,920
 You're worried and upset about many things.

495
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,080
 And so the second question that I see here in this text

496
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,480
 is what are the dangers of those distractions?

497
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,040
 Here in this little section, we see the outcome

498
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,240
 of the result of Martha's distractions.

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,740
 What are the dangers of those distractions?

500
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,940
 Martha begins to blame others for her troubles.

501
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,880
 This is what we do when we've been distracted from Christ,

502
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
 we're not abiding with Christ.

503
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,720
 We begin to look for excuses.

504
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,320
 Well, of course he got the job, okay?

505
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,000
 The boss likes him, it's favoritism.

506
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,640
 She's prettier than I am.

507
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,560
 Of course that happened.

508
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,000
 Another thing is if we're sitting there

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 and we're having a quiet time, if you will,

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
 but we don't really wanna be, and other people are playing,

511
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,640
 there can be like jealousy that raises up in our heart.

512
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,040
 Why aren't they doing the work that I'm doing?

513
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,640
 And you begin to blame others.

514
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,800
 The next thing that Martha does

515
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,320
 is she questions God's love for her.

516
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,680
 Such a temptation when we neglect Jesus.

517
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
 God, don't you care?

518
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,880
 I talk to people all the time that are frustrated

519
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,480
 by the outcome of their lives when they're angry at God.

520
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
 And the reality of it is is they haven't,

521
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,160
 God hasn't been a part of any of those decisions.

522
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,980
 It wasn't like God told her to date the guy

523
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,100
 that was gonna break her heart.

524
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,280
 Like God wasn't a part of that decision.

525
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,520
 As I think about in my own life this week,

526
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,520
 I know there's a lot of materialistic illustrations here

527
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,280
 just to give you a picture of the dark corners of my heart.

528
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,560
 This week we had been contemplating or thinking about,

529
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,760
 considering a new car for my wife,

530
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,600
 and there was one particular one that I was interested in,

531
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,240
 and I was thinking about it.

532
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,900
 I met with community about it.

533
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,020
 I even talked to pastors about it,

534
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,560
 asking others is this a good idea.

535
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,000
 I asked others to pray about it.

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,120
 Would you just pray for me?

537
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,440
 And this decision was just sitting heavy on me.

538
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,320
 And I almost had this like,

539
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,620
 God, why don't you give me clarity?

540
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,320
 Like tell me what to do.

541
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,220
 And then I woke up at like three in the morning one night,

542
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,720
 and I just heard you hadn't asked me.

543
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,760
 And I realized it was just like this moment,

544
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,000
 like I hadn't even consulted with God about this decision.

545
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
 I had asked others to,

546
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,480
 but I had been so distracted by the decision,

547
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,000
 so distracted with processing all the data

548
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
 and the information that I hadn't even gone to God myself.

549
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
 And so I'm like, Jesus, I'm sorry that I haven't asked you.

550
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
 Should we get this car?

551
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,680
 And immediately my heart, my mind goes to all

552
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,360
 of the materialistic reasons that I wanted to buy this car,

553
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 the comforts and the perception and just the nice features.

554
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,320
 And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that.

555
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,720
 I'm not gonna do that.

556
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,860
 Thank you, Jesus.

557
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,960
 So others get frustrated by how work is going,

558
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,760
 relationships are going, how family is going,

559
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,840
 but they never really spend any amount of extended time

560
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,560
 with Christ asking him to change the circumstance.

561
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,840
 I'm not talking about fly-by prayers while you're driving.

562
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,080
 I'm talking about sitting still for extended time

563
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,480
 at the feet of Christ.

564
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,800
 Another thing that Martha does here in her distractions,

565
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 and this is a big one, she tells God what to do.

566
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,840
 Such a different posturing than Mary sitting

567
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,240
 at the feet of Christ, that she's so distracted

568
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,120
 that she gets caught up in the self-centeredness.

569
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,300
 Again, I believe wanting the approval of others

570
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,640
 that in a moment she thinks that she can tell God,

571
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,560
 the one who formed her in her mother's womb, what to do.

572
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200
 She doesn't realize who Christ is.

573
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,880
 She's ordering him around in this moment.

574
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,520
 Tell her to stop.

575
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,040
 God, give me the job.

576
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,840
 You're gonna keep me single forever?

577
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,080
 What do you do?

578
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,920
 You sleeping up there?

579
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,320
 Do you not see me down here?

580
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,120
 And maybe you don't say that out loud,

581
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,080
 but maybe that's the cry of your heart.

582
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,280
 And it's time to sit still.

583
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,340
 In the servant's position at the feet of the Lord Almighty.

584
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,840
 Saying, I can't, but you can.

585
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,440
 I can't, but you can.

586
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,400
 See, there's this epidemic in our culture

587
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,740
 that's self-centeredness, some call it narcissism,

588
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,480
 that is leading to the greatest levels of depression

589
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,920
 the world has ever seen.

590
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,800
 The highest levels of anxiety

591
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,920
 the world as we know it have ever seen.

592
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,280
 And it starts with this idea

593
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,320
 that we think we control things.

594
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
 We don't control things.

595
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,640
 God controls things.

596
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
 So you'd be better off spending time

597
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,700
 with the one who controls everything.

598
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,480
 Martha's anxious, it says.

599
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,760
 She's worried and anxious about many things.

600
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,880
 This comes from thinking that she's in control.

601
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,800
 It comes to a place of realizing,

602
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,960
 I don't have what it takes.

603
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
 And if you realize that you don't have what it takes

604
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,120
 and it drives you to a place of humility,

605
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,160
 drives you to a place of a humble and contrite spirit.

606
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,760
 God, I don't have what it takes, but you do.

607
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,600
 That's a good thing.

608
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,040
 But if it's like, I don't have what it takes

609
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,000
 and I'm still trying to manage it all, that's a bad thing.

610
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 That's why we've said here,

611
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,520
 if dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.

612
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,720
 My friend Cheryl shared that with me years ago

613
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,800
 and it's just become a mantra of my life.

614
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,360
 If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.

615
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
 Tweet that out.

616
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,140
 Oh wait, nevermind.

617
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,560
 If dependence is the goal.

618
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,760
 It's good.

619
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,240
 It's good for my self-esteem, that guy.

620
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,760
 If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.

621
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,620
 There's this picture that has ministered to me this week

622
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,320
 of clinging to the Father,

623
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
 clinging to someone.

624
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,920
 At the lake this weekend, we did some wake surfing.

625
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,760
 Have you done this?

626
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,600
 It's fun.

627
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,280
 And my son, my three-year-old, he like desperately,

628
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
 I'm behind the boat, we're wake surfing,

629
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,920
 and my three-year-old like desperately wants to do it.

630
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
 Daddy, let me on, Daddy.

631
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,280
 He's just on the back of the boat, just chatting.

632
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,480
 Let me do it, I wanna do it, I wanna do it.

633
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
 He's three, you know.

634
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,120
 And so finally, I'm like, all right,

635
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
 come in the water with me.

636
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,400
 And I hold him and I'm like, hey, I want you to hug my neck.

637
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,480
 And then I'm in the water, I'm like drowning.

638
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,960
 I'm like, okay, not that tight, not that tight.

639
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,160
 (audience laughing)

640
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,400
 And so he's just holding my neck and they pull me up

641
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,800
 and I set him down on the surfboard.

642
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,920
 And he is just, I mean, he's looking around

643
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,240
 and just clinging to my leg.

644
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,180
 I have a picture.

645
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,040
 This is Weston just clinging to his Daddy

646
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,560
 as tight as he can, smiling ear to ear,

647
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,420
 not gonna let you go.

648
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,920
 There's nothing that's gonna separate me from you.

649
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 And this is a picture of what I believe Christ wants from us.

650
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,600
 Just this cling, this holding on to,

651
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,120
 nothing's going to rip me, nothing's gonna come between us.

652
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,280
 Nothing's gonna pull me away, distract me from you.

653
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,360
 I'm gonna hold on right here.

654
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,240
 If dependence is the goal, weakness is my advantage.

655
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
 I don't have what it takes, you have what it takes.

656
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,340
 I'm just gonna hold on to you.

657
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,880
 We feel so counterintuitive when we're busy

658
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,400
 to sit still with Jesus.

659
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,880
 I acknowledge that.

660
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,240
 But it is completely necessary.

661
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,080
 We've never been busier as a culture,

662
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,120
 but I don't know that God's gonna receive that excuse.

663
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,800
 Get up there and you're like,

664
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,040
 how come we never spend time together?

665
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,440
 Well, God, don't you know I was born,

666
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,040
 you know, I lived in 2016.

667
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,200
 It was the busiest culture we've ever had.

668
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,440
 You knew that, right?

669
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,000
 I don't think that's gonna fly.

670
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,400
 I've heard that busy is an acronym.

671
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,560
 Being under Satan's yoke.

672
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,640
 Being under Satan's yoke

673
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
 is what it means to be busy,

674
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,200
 that he uses that to distract us.

675
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,880
 Martin Luther said, "I have so much to do today,

676
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,340
 "I must spend the first four hours in prayer,"

677
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,840
 which is a picture of that, of how counterintuitive it is.

678
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
 It's like, I have so much to do today

679
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,280
 that I must start by focusing my heart and my mind

680
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,440
 on the only one who can get it all done.

681
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,960
 So blaming others and doubting God

682
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,280
 and narcissism and anxiety,

683
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,040
 they're all outcomes of being distracted

684
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,240
 from the main thing, verse 42.

685
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,560
 But few things are needed, Jesus responds.

686
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,500
 Actually, it's only one.

687
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,280
 And Mary has chosen that.

688
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,920
 She's chosen what is better.

689
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,280
 And then he says this strange phrase,

690
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,960
 "And it will not be taken away from her."

691
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
 I've wrestled with for a week, what does that mean?

692
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
 And it will not be taken away from her.

693
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,880
 I'm pretty excited about some of what I've found.

694
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
 And so my third question this evening is,

695
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,280
 is your life marked by distraction or devotion?

696
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,800
 It's a dichotomy.

697
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 Mary was known to this day for devotion.

698
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,520
 Martha often memorialized to this day

699
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,680
 for her distraction.

700
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,760
 What marks you, your life today?

701
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
 Do people, coworkers, friends, family, roommates,

702
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
 those that know you best say,

703
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,760
 "Oh man, that is one devoted brother.

704
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,300
 "She is very devoted to her faith, devoted to Christ."

705
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,880
 Or, no, she's kind of always stressed out,

706
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,980
 distracted, pulled away, lots of different directions.

707
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
 Mary is sitting at Jesus's feet.

708
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,480
 This literally means she's being taught by him.

709
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,280
 It's the same word that we see in Acts 22, verse three,

710
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,840
 the same phrase where it says,

711
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,240
 Paul's talking about himself.

712
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,520
 I studied under Gamaliel, okay, the rabbi.

713
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,080
 He's saying, it says in the Greek, the same phrase,

714
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,760
 I sat at Gamaliel's feet.

715
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,160
 Mary is sitting at Jesus's feet.

716
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,540
 That is, she's studying under Jesus.

717
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,320
 There has to be a part of our relationship with Christ

718
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,760
 that is spent studying him, knowing about him.

719
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,120
 It's like when you're in love with someone

720
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,320
 and you want to know their favorite things,

721
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,400
 what they like, what they like to do,

722
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,120
 where they like to eat, her favorite flowers,

723
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
 those sorts of things.

724
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,440
 My girls are nine and seven,

725
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,800
 and they have just started in the past year

726
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,360
 reading the Bible, and so prestly,

727
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
 my nine-year-old will wake up,

728
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,200
 and before she does anything, she reads a chapter.

729
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,920
 She wanted to get baptized, and I just said,

730
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,560
 hey, before you get baptized,

731
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,120
 I'd like you to read through the book of John.

732
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,560
 So she's reading a chapter a day right now.

733
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,240
 And so Finley, my seven-year-old,

734
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,040
 has picked this up as well.

735
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,640
 And so I'll just ask them afterwards,

736
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,000
 you know, what did you learn?

737
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,280
 And my seven-year-old, who's probably a little young

738
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,720
 for the assignment, has just come back to me,

739
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,320
 and I said, Finley, what did you learn?

740
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,200
 She said, I don't know.

741
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,040
 Well, what did you read?

742
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,860
 I don't know.

743
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,700
 Well, who were the characters?

744
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,840
 I don't know.

745
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,880
 Baby girl, how do you not know?

746
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,000
 And she just breaks down sobbing.

747
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,080
 She says, Daddy, the Bible is so confusing.

748
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,880
 The words are so big,

749
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,720
 and I just don't understand what it's saying.

750
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,200
 And my hunch is that some of us are 27,

751
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,700
 and we feel the same way.

752
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,440
 That we open it up, and it's not like,

753
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,720
 like we're almost envious of our friends that are like,

754
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,920
 oh man, I just sat with Jesus today.

755
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,520
 I got so much from him.

756
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,520
 Man, it was amazing.

757
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,700
 I was just like, me and Jesus, like having breakfast.

758
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,540
 It was incredible.

759
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,160
 He just told me all this stuff.

760
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
 It's awesome.

761
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,480
 And you're just like, really?

762
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,240
 From Leviticus?

763
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,080
 Like, I mean.

764
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:34,240
 And so my little girl's like, Daddy, I don't read well,

765
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,780
 to which I say, what a gift.

766
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,420
 I don't read well either, Finley.

767
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,860
 Not very good at reading.

768
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,640
 So you know what it means?

769
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,700
 I have to read slow.

770
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,360
 I have to take it in.

771
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,960
 I have to read it multiple times.

772
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,540
 What a gift not to read well.

773
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,080
 I have to spend extended time with Jesus.

774
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,240
 I have to let the Spirit of God make known to me

775
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,800
 the things of God through the word of God,

776
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,500
 so that I might be the man of God.

777
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,960
 What a gift not to read well.

778
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
 And if you don't read well, consider that the gift it is

779
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,800
 to live in 2016, that we have podcasts and preachers.

780
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,480
 We have books on tape.

781
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,760
 We can have someone read the Bible to us.

782
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,720
 We can watch it.

783
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,080
 We can have it illustrated.

784
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,600
 If you're an audible learner or a visual learner,

785
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,240
 you can talk about it in community.

786
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,640
 You can go line by line, what does this mean?

787
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,920
 You can be discipled, have others teach it to you.

788
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,320
 You can enroll in a place where they literally

789
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800
 will sit there and tell you what every single word

790
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,720
 means, and you have to know what makes you love Jesus more.

791
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,760
 You have to.

792
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,120
 A part of your time with him has to be learning about him

793
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,360
 like any great relationship.

794
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,440
 And I love, not to go on a tangent here,

795
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,400
 but I love that Jesus was not sexist.

796
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,440
 That he believed that women were an extremely important

797
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,720
 part of the church, that he was a revolutionary.

798
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,120
 He did what no one else would do, and he said,

799
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,000
 "Come here, let me instruct you,

800
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,880
 "'cause you, ma'am, have a role to play

801
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,680
 "in the work that I'm doing."

802
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,680
 But it's also, it's not just learning,

803
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
 it's also a posturing of submission

804
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,480
 that Mary would sit at his feet.

805
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,400
 She's acknowledging that he was Lord.

806
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
 And this blew my mind, like get ready for this,

807
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,360
 'cause this is really fun about this text

808
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
 and about this person.

809
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,280
 Mary shows up in the scripture three times,

810
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,000
 and you see two words over and over all three times.

811
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,840
 You ready?

812
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,560
 Mary and feet.

813
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,840
 Mary and feet.

814
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,600
 And I don't think she had a foot fetish, okay?

815
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,360
 I'm not trying to be disrespectful.

816
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,200
 I just wanna paint the picture

817
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,280
 that there's something else going on here,

818
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,800
 that every time Mary shows up on the scene,

819
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 she is at all three times Jesus' feet in John 11, 32,

820
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,240
 when Lazarus has died.

821
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,840
 It says, "When Mary reached the place where Jesus was

822
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
 "and saw him, she fell at his feet."

823
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:09,400
 And then, in another meal in John 12, verse three,

824
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,440
 it says, "Then Mary, same Mary,

825
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,900
 "took a pint of pure nard," weird word,

826
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,480
 "and expensive perfume, an expensive perfume,

827
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,580
 "and she poured it on Jesus' feet

828
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,880
 "and wiped his feet with her hair,

829
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,560
 "acknowledging him as God."

830
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,400
 And what Jesus says is, "She's preparing me for burial."

831
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,080
 Trivia question, who was the first person

832
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,800
 in Jesus' lifetime on earth

833
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,840
 who knew that he was going to die?

834
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,160
 It was Mary.

835
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,040
 He says, "She's preparing me for burial."

836
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,200
 And everybody's like, "What are you talking?

837
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,280
 "That's not figurative.

838
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,680
 "Oh, you're literally, what?

839
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,840
 "You're gonna die."

840
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,760
 Mary knew, why?

841
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,920
 She spent time with him, listening to him,

842
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,480
 talking with him.

843
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,340
 When you spend time with Jesus, you learn about him.

844
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,600
 The Spirit of God makes known to you the things of God

845
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,120
 through the word of God so that you might be the man

846
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,440
 or woman of God.

847
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,880
 I'll tell you, the only reason that a man or woman

848
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,400
 would read their Bible is because they believe

849
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
 they don't have it all figured out.

850
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,120
 And that God, who's sovereign creator,

851
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,320
 he knows better than they do.

852
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,800
 And so it's a posturing of submission.

853
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,840
 And the only reason that a man or a woman

854
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,880
 does not read the Bible is because they don't believe

855
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,520
 it's a worthwhile activity.

856
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,840
 They believe that they have something better to do.

857
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,480
 It's the only reason someone doesn't read the Scriptures.

858
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,980
 And so what Mary learned from him,

859
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,700
 it says, will not be taken from her.

860
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,340
 That Mary somehow in that moment invested in something

861
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,640
 that would last forever, which let's all agree

862
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,980
 that's a great investment.

863
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,580
 Diamonds are not forever, contrary to the popular ad.

864
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:17,000
 But whatever you might do with Christ lasts forever here.

865
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,240
 It will not be taken away from her.

866
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,360
 And I just wanna show you something

867
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,960
 that is exciting to me, because when the disciples

868
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,680
 come to her and rebuke her because she breaks

869
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,040
 this expensive perfume on Jesus' feet,

870
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,860
 it says this, when the disciples saw this,

871
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,000
 they were indignant.

872
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,500
 Why this waste, they asked.

873
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,840
 This perfume could have been sold at a high price

874
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,720
 and the money given to the poor.

875
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,000
 Aware of this, Jesus said to them,

876
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,200
 why are you bothering this woman, Mary?

877
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,880
 She has done a beautiful thing to me.

878
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,180
 The poor you will always have with you,

879
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,960
 but you will not always have me

880
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,360
 when she poured this perfume on my body.

881
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,080
 She did it to prepare me for burial.

882
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,760
 Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached

883
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,360
 throughout the world, what she has done

884
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,560
 will also be told in memory of her.

885
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,560
 And 2,000 years later, that prophecy is fulfilled tonight

886
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,320
 as we declare the gospel that Jesus Christ

887
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,360
 has died for your sins, that God has raised him

888
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,760
 from the dead, and before he did,

889
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,460
 there was a woman named Mary who anointed him for burial,

890
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,480
 and Christ said just before that at a meal,

891
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,340
 what she has done will not be taken away from her.

892
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,080
 That there is some profound reality

893
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,840
 that you can make an investment in eternity

894
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,320
 by the things that you've done in the name of Jesus Christ,

895
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,640
 that is with Christ, and the things that you've learned

896
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,160
 from Christ by being with Christ

897
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,640
 will last forever and ever and ever.

898
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,000
 First Timothy four, verse eight says this.

899
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,100
 For physical training, can the gym be a distraction?

900
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,040
 Not for me.

901
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,340
 For physical training,

902
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,520
 for physical training is of some value,

903
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,040
 but godliness has value for all things,

904
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,100
 holding promise for both the present life

905
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,160
 and the life to come, and the life to come,

906
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,440
 and the life to come.

907
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,120
 I've gotta leave you with this as we wrap up.

908
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,360
 Life's a journey of learning what is important.

909
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 Now I'm gonna say this, you're gonna agree with me,

910
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,680
 I just, just hang in there with me,

911
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,600
 'cause I see this is so true in my children.

912
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,400
 So true in my kids, that Weston, my three-year-old,

913
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,240
 he has a night-night, it's a blankie.

914
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,600
 And my girls had one too, but now that Finley's seven,

915
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,920
 she looks back and like, oh, Weston loves his blankie,

916
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,520
 it's so cute, you know, it's silly.

917
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,640
 I'm like, you did too.

918
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
 She's like, no, I know what's important now,

919
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,640
 I've got Kitty, she's got a stuffed animal named Kitty.

920
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,340
 This is the stuff that's important, you know?

921
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,760
 And Presley, my nine-year-old's like, ah, she's so silly,

922
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,880
 she's got her stuffed animal Kitty.

923
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,760
 I'm like, Presley, you did too.

924
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,200
 I've got these coloring books over here,

925
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,840
 this is where it's at, you know?

926
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,520
 Arts and crafts, she's into, that's where she's at.

927
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,960
 She finds life, and it just continues, right?

928
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,160
 You get to high school and it's like,

929
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,520
 oh, now I know what's important.

930
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,140
 I gotta make the team, get the letter jacket,

931
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,580
 I gotta get asked to prom,

932
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,720
 I gotta have these right relationships,

933
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,040
 this is what's important.

934
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,440
 Kitties and coloring books and night-night, so silly,

935
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,600
 this is what's important.

936
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,240
 And you get to college and you like, look back,

937
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
 you're like, letter jacket, what was I thinking?

938
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,380
 Now I know what's important, right?

939
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,000
 Now I know, it's fraternities and sororities

940
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,780
 and getting the right professor and making the grade

941
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,880
 and getting a diploma from the right school.

942
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,440
 Now I know what's important, silly me, letter jacket.

943
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,720
 And then you get out of college and you're like,

944
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,080
 what was I thinking, sorority, fraternity?

945
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,920
 What a waste, I've gotta get a good job.

946
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,400
 I've gotta make good money.

947
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,600
 I gotta somehow convince some human being

948
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,560
 to spend the rest of their life with me.

949
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,560
 (congregation laughing)

950
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,600
 Now I know what is important, right?

951
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,660
 And then you get there and I'm just gonna telegraph

952
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,360
 for you a little bit what's coming

953
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,280
 'cause you're gonna get there and be like,

954
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,680
 what was I thinking, now I know what's important,

955
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,160
 I gotta have kids.

956
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,420
 And then your kids grow up and you're like,

957
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,800
 now I gotta make sure my kids go to good schools

958
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,820
 and get good grades and get the right professors.

959
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,460
 And it just goes on and on and on.

960
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,480
 And here's what I'm telling you is one day,

961
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
 you're gonna look back and I'm serious,

962
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,320
 you gotta believe this, okay?

963
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,760
 You gotta hear me 'cause this book doesn't lie.

964
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,340
 One day you're gonna look back like,

965
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,800
 oh, the only things that were important

966
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,540
 were the things that last forever.

967
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,960
 That's what was really important,

968
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,080
 the times that lasted forever,

969
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,920
 the investments in eternity, the times with Jesus.

970
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,880
 I wasted so much time worried about letter jackets and jobs

971
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,280
 and so many other good things that are good things.

972
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,880
 They're just not ultimate things.

973
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,560
 And so there are many distractions

974
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,840
 that pull us away from Jesus,

975
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,920
 like to-do lists and wanting the approval of others.

976
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,180
 And these distractions have detrimental outcomes

977
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,140
 like blaming others and doubting God

978
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,480
 and narcissism and anxiety.

979
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,480
 And Christ, through his servant, Mary,

980
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,280
 and his servant, Martha, is calling you to live a life

981
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,760
 in devotion to Jesus that's sitting with him,

982
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,440
 fighting anything that is distracting you from him.

983
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,200
 Last night, I had to go write this message,

984
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,800
 but before I did, I was talking to my girls.

985
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,320
 I was laying in Presley's bed

986
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,720
 and she comes up and crawls on top of me

987
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,800
 and puts her head on my chest and looks up at me.

988
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,220
 And she's like, "Daddy,

989
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,720
 "I feel like we don't go on dates anymore."

990
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,560
 I'm like, "Baby girl, we go on dates,

991
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,520
 "we just went on a date last week."

992
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,720
 She's like, "I know, but before that,

993
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,200
 "I just feel like it's been a long time."

994
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,840
 And I begin to defend myself.

995
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,660
 I start telling them, I'm like,

996
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,640
 "Well, sweetie, there's three of you now.

997
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,100
 "We had more kids and they have to share time with Daddy.

998
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,140
 "And plus, your mom is a priority to me.

999
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,400
 "And so if I'm gonna have one date,

1000
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,720
 "it's gonna be with her."

1001
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,600
 And I begin to talk, and then it dawns on me,

1002
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,000
 I'm like, "Wait a minute, just the week before last,

1003
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,080
 "I invited you on a date too.

1004
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,540
 "Remember, it was Awakened down in Clyde Warm Park

1005
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,600
 "and I went to you and I said,

1006
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,840
 "Hey, I want you to come with me.

1007
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,640
 "I think it's gonna be a good time."

1008
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,380
 And she was like, "Yeah, but Daddy, we were watching a movie.

1009
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,560
 "Finley and I were watching a movie

1010
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,160
 "and we were gonna have fun."

1011
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,640
 And Daddy, that just didn't sound very fun.

1012
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
 More church, you know?

1013
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,860
 (congregation laughing)

1014
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,800
 And I said, "Oh."

1015
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,820
 I said, "Baby girl, I don't know

1016
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,400
 "that you want time with me.

1017
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,700
 "I think you're chasing experiences.

1018
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,600
 "Like you're just looking for outlets to have fun.

1019
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,460
 "You don't really want time with me."

1020
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,700
 And as I think about us and I think about this generation,

1021
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,440
 I really resonate with Presley.

1022
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,600
 Like I'm all about, like let's go on an international trip,

1023
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,440
 launch retreat, man.

1024
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,480
 Like anything that's gonna be fun.

1025
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,280
 Like Robbie C leading worship, the porch.

1026
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,120
 I'm in on that.

1027
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,040
 You want me to sit still with Jesus?

1028
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,840
 Don't sound like I'm having fun.

1029
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
 I've got 23,000 emails.

1030
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,480
 (congregation laughing)

1031
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,880
 I just want him to be still and just talk to him.

1032
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,840
 I want you to love him.

1033
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,840
 He, he wants you to love him.

1034
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:09,020
 Know him, learn about him, spend time with him.

1035
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,180
 Is this not the gospel?

1036
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,340
 We can't work our way to Jesus that he did the work,

1037
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,660
 that he paid it all.

1038
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,600
 We sit still and trust.

1039
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,800
 And to model that we've believed upon the gospel,

1040
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,280
 we would say like Martin Luther,

1041
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,680
 I have so much to do in this life.

1042
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,440
 It better start by sitting still

1043
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,320
 and letting my God work for me.

1044
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,140
 'Cause what am I gonna do without him?

1045
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,540
 There's nothing that I can do for him without him.

1046
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,120
 I can't even save myself.

1047
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,820
 I need him to pay it all.

1048
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,460
 Let me pray for us.

1049
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,260
 Father, that is the truth.

1050
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,320
 We can't do anything without you.

1051
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,640
 We need your help.

1052
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:16,120
 Lord, we thank you for the work that you did on our behalf.

1053
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,240
 Work we couldn't do,

1054
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,520
 work we literally were not good enough to do.

1055
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,020
 'Cause none of us are perfect.

1056
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,020
 And so as you required a perfect payment,

1057
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,300
 none of us would do.

1058
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,240
 It took your son.

1059
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,240
 God, thank you for the example of Mary

1060
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,320
 that we might follow it.

1061
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,360
 And thank you also for the example of Martha,

1062
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,600
 who is with you now, seen as blameless,

1063
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,660
 her sins not held against her.

1064
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,080
 Serving you in your presence

1065
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,600
 forever and ever and ever,

1066
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,960
 sitting with you forever and ever and ever,

1067
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,960
 worshiping you forever and ever and ever.

1068
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,320
 May we do the same.

1069
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:09,120
 It is this reality that Jesus did the work for you.

1070
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,120
 Nobody who has ever lived is going to get to heaven

1071
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,440
 because of what they've done,

1072
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,160
 good or bad.

1073
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,520
 There is no single deed

1074
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,520
 that is going to keep anyone from heaven.

1075
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,400
 No particular sin, no act that you've committed

1076
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,920
 that is gonna be the one thing that keeps you out.

1077
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,240
 It's going to come down to one reality.

1078
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,240
 Do you believe that roughly 2,000 years ago

1079
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,320
 that God paid a price, paid is the word,

1080
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,640
 paid a price, paid it all,

1081
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,440
 all of your sin, past, present, and future,

1082
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
 on the cross, he paid for it?

1083
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,600
 That he died, he paid for it with his own blood,

1084
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,560
 his whole life?

1085
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,680
 He goes in the grave.

1086
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,360
 And to show you that he's God,

1087
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,680
 that he's bigger than death,

1088
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,640
 and to give you hope for eternity,

1089
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,120
 and to help you today by the power of his spirit

1090
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,600
 living with you, he raises from the dead.

1091
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,680
 Yes, it's good news.

1092
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,720
 It's good news that you don't get to heaven

1093
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,360
 because of what you do,

1094
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,120
 but because of what Christ did,

1095
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,120
 that he paid it all, if you trust in that.

1096
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,620
 (congregation applauding)

1097
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,320
 Martha is in heaven.

1098
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,000
 We're gonna meet her one day.

1099
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,880
 It's gonna be awesome.

1100
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,720
 Not because of what she did,

1101
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,600
 but because of the one that she was with, what he did.

1102
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,440
 And so if we could talk with you more about that,

1103
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,080
 there's a bunch of people here in gray port shirts

1104
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,400
 that serve here, they're co-pastors, co-labors with me.

1105
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,240
 They'd love to pray with you and for you.

1106
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,840
 If you're in search of community,

1107
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,880
 you're thinking, hey, I need to buy a car,

1108
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,240
 and I don't have anyone to process that with.

1109
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,320
 We can change that tonight, okay?

1110
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,120
 Guys, you can walk down this hallway.

1111
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,320
 There's a room full of guys there

1112
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,520
 that would love to meet you.

1113
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,960
 Girls, you walk down this hallway,

1114
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,400
 there's a room full of girls there

1115
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,160
 that would love to meet you.

1116
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,000
 And you could just say,

1117
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,720
 what is community that he's talking about?

1118
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,320
 And they would love to tell you.

1119
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,000
 There's a party out there,

1120
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,040
 porch late nights happening tonight.

1121
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,760
 So you guys stay, hang out, have fun,

1122
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,720
 go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

1123
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,300
 (upbeat music)
