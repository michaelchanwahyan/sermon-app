[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   All right, let's go, let's go.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.800]   Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.160]   Welcome to our live locations.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.360]   Tuning in from the Porch Fort Worth,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   we have Porch Tulsa in a new live location,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.120]   all the way in Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.360]   And of course, welcome tonight to my friends
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360]   here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.560]   Let's go.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.760]   We are heading into night two of our new series,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.360]   like you saw, Fortune Telling, where
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.440]   we are committed for the next few weeks
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440]   together to take God's word from the past, words
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.040]   from the past, and let them speak to your future reality.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.400]   Because you can go to Fortune Tellers,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440]   which we do not promote.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.520]   You can go to the internet and Google
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.280]   and try to go to people and counselors
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.040]   and all these different things and figure out
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.440]   what your future might look like.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.360]   But the reality is, is there's only one who knows,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.480]   and it's God.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600]   And tonight, we're going to see what his word has to say.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440]   Last week, we asked the question, hey,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.400]   regarding my future, will I be forever alone?
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.800]   And before I tell you tonight's question
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   that we are answering with God's word,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.360]   I thought I would ask you guys, do you
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.200]   recognize my friend here, DudeWithSign?
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.720]   Anyone?
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.400]   Anyone follow DudeWithSign?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.880]   He's a phenomenon.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560]   7.4 million followers, I believe, on Instagram,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.600]   all by going to a street corner in different cities
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.520]   and holding up a cardboard sign.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.160]   This is 2021.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840]   And he holds up signs and messages
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.960]   like this, which I really appreciate.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   What's another one?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760]   Fellas, Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.960]   You can use this sign to slide into someone's DMs,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.800]   take a picture if you want.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   Last but not least, reminder to cancel your free trial
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.400]   before they charge you.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   Some of you are like, getting your phones out.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   And when you look at DudeWithSign,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   it might just seem like something simple,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   but the reality is, is that guy's purpose in life
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.560]   now is literally, literally to carry a message.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.520]   He is constantly using his life to send a message.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.480]   And I start there because tonight,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.960]   we are asking the question, will I be truly forgiven?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.080]   Will I be truly forgiven?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.520]   And the reason why I'm talking about a message
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.720]   and the idea of forgiveness is because I
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.200]   think the reason why a lot of us don't believe
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.520]   that our life, our future can be used by God
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.360]   to declare a message to the world,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.680]   that God can't really use us because we don't actually
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.640]   believe that our future is worth using because we don't believe
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.520]   that we're actually forgiven from our past.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.680]   There is something in your life that holds you back.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.920]   There is something that Satan uses to tell you
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.880]   that you're unworthy.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.920]   That man, if God's going to use anyone in this room,
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   it definitely isn't you.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.280]   You're just kind of the-- you just kind of come
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   and sit in the back.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   See you up there, top row.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.000]   Much love.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   You come here and you tell yourself,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   maybe God will use him or her, but not me.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.400]   And I don't know if that's because of addiction.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.360]   I don't know if that's because of a secret sin.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.120]   I don't know if because you've used your whole life
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.160]   to build up some image through Instagram
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.240]   and through your friends that you want people to think
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.880]   that you're living in the perfect Dallas life
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.920]   with the good job and the dog and the going down to downtown
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.640]   and hanging out in uptown and all these different things.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.520]   But you think, man, God doesn't want to use my past
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.560]   to send a message to people about him
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.120]   because my past is riddled with so much insecurity,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.640]   so many mistakes.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.080]   God might use them, but not me.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.040]   And I would tell you that if you think that's true of you
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.960]   is because you might be believing
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.000]   that you are not actually forgiven
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.200]   and you might not have a right reality
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.080]   of what forgiveness actually means for you.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.160]   There might be some people tonight
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.200]   that you're not really even,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.520]   you don't really even care if like,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.200]   what do you mean God used my past?
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.520]   God used my story.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.400]   What does that even mean?
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.800]   Like what forgiveness?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.960]   Like I'm a good person.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.920]   I don't have much to be forgiven from.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.640]   Like, what are you talking about?
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.760]   And we're going to talk about that tonight.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.080]   And we're going to do that by looking at a story,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.200]   one of my favorite stories in the book of Luke,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.920]   one of the gospels in the New Testament.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   And it's this account,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.480]   it's this story of an interaction between Jesus
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.160]   and two people.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.560]   And it really hits home, this idea of forgiveness
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.280]   and what Jesus thinks about forgiveness.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   And the reason why we're spending a night
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.080]   talking about this idea of forgiveness
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.660]   is because if a person truly understands
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.920]   that they've been forgiven,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.440]   if you truly believe that,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.840]   and there's no telling what God could do with your future.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.420]   So if you would, if you have your Bibles,
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.500]   open up to Luke chapter seven.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.140]   Luke chapter seven, verse 36,
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.740]   is we're going to read a story tonight.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.020]   It's going to be a little lengthy.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.540]   So zone in these next few minutes together.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.660]   And let's start in verse 36.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.480]   Here we go.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.560]   It's up on the screen if you don't have your Bible.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.180]   One of the Pharisees,
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.700]   Pharisees are, if you don't know,
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.740]   just like a religious leader of that day.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.000]   They kind of know all the rules
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.540]   and they kind of go around telling people
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.580]   when they're doing something wrong
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.860]   and when they need to be doing something right.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.820]   They kind of take care of all the spiritual
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.100]   and religious rituals of that day.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.940]   One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.340]   So Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.060]   When a certain immoral woman,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.920]   immoral just kind of means a very sinful person.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.940]   When a certain immoral woman from that city
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.600]   heard that he was eating there,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.720]   she brought a beautiful alabaster jar
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.500]   filled with expensive perfume.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   Just kind of think like Gucci of today.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.880]   Then Jesus knelt before him,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.140]   or then she knelt before him at his feet, weeping.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.540]   Her tears fell on his feet
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.980]   and she wiped them off with her hair.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.220]   And then she kept kissing his feet
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.780]   and putting perfume on them.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.980]   And I know if you've never read this,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.660]   you're kind of like, what is going on?
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.180]   This is some freaky stuff.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.700]   And yes, it is a little weird,
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.460]   but I promise it's gonna end up being super beautiful.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.440]   It's just stay with me.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.100]   So when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.700]   he said to himself, if this man were a prophet,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.100]   someone that could kind of just like tell the future
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.220]   and all these different things,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.260]   he would know that what kind of woman is touching him.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.540]   She's a sinner.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.260]   Then Jesus answered his thoughts,
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.900]   telling me that Jesus can read our minds.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.140]   He just could read people's minds this day, which is crazy.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.660]   Then Jesus answered his thoughts.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.260]   Simon, he said to the Pharisee,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.380]   I have something to say to you.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.740]   Go ahead, teacher.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.980]   Simon replied.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.700]   Then Jesus told him this story.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.540]   A man loaned money to two people,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.060]   500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.480]   but neither of them could repay him.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.940]   So he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.740]   Who do you suppose loved him more after that?
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.140]   Simon answered, I suppose the one
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.180]   for whom he canceled the larger debt.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.740]   That's right, Jesus said.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.340]   Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.120]   look at this woman kneeling here.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.620]   When I entered your home,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.140]   you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet,
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.300]   but she has washed them with her tears
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.900]   and wiped them with her hair.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.380]   You didn't greet me with a kiss,
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.300]   but from the time I first came in,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   she has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.180]   You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.260]   but she has anointed my feet with her rare perfume.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.260]   I tell you her sins, and they are many,
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.540]   have been forgiven.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.560]   So she has shown me much love,
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.660]   but a person who is forgiven little shows only a little love.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.840]   Then Jesus said to the woman, your sins are forgiven.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.220]   The men at the table said among themselves,
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.700]   who is this man that he goes around forgiving sins?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.200]   And Jesus said to the woman,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.660]   your faith has saved you, go in peace.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.420]   And so just to make sure you understand,
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.820]   we're really highlighting three characters in this story.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.100]   First, you have Jesus who has come down from heaven
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.340]   as the son of God to take away the sins of the world.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.620]   He is the savior of the world.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.900]   He's a really big deal,
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.260]   especially in this story and in your story.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.200]   The next one, we have the Pharisee, the religious leader,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.460]   the guy who knew all the rules,
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.160]   the guy that had read the scrolls, read the Bible.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.140]   And then lastly, we have a sinful woman.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.900]   We don't know exactly what they mean by a sinful woman.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.060]   We just know that she had a reputation of sinning a lot.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.860]   Commentators think that maybe she was a prostitute,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.020]   that maybe she had the reputation of a whore.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.820]   But what the writer Luke is trying to get you to see
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.600]   is no matter what it was,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.480]   her reputation was that of a sinner.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.100]   But what's so funny is when you look at this,
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.060]   the person who knew about God, the Pharisee,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.580]   was the one judging Jesus,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.380]   saying, "Does this guy know who's touching him?
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.900]   Like, this guy must not be a prophet."
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.780]   Just sitting across the table, judging him.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.260]   And the sinner, the one who doesn't know God,
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.940]   the one who's, you know, "What is she doing touching Jesus?"
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.700]   She was the one who was actually worshiping him.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.940]   She was the one that Jesus was proud to be with,
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.740]   that Jesus was complimenting.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.140]   So what did she, a sinner,
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.660]   have figured out that the religious leader did not?
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.440]   I think she understood forgiveness.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.840]   I think the Pharisee didn't understand forgiveness.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.260]   And that had radical implications
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.060]   on their response to Jesus.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.000]   And I think tonight, your understanding of forgiveness,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.220]   if you're coming in here asking the question,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.380]   "Will I ever truly be forgiven?
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.180]   Will my past always haunt me?
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.060]   Will that mistake always define me?
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.060]   Can God really use me?
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.540]   Can God really use this story?"
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.180]   I think if you truly have the right view of forgiveness,
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.260]   it will have radical implications on your view of Jesus.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.620]   Therefore, it will have radical implications
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.820]   on the way that you view your life.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.100]   So I'm gonna show you how, through God's word,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.540]   which leads me to my first point,
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.420]   on how to know if you will truly be forgiven.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.600]   Step one, admit you have a problem.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.900]   How do you know you'll be forgiven?
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.260]   You first have to admit
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.180]   that there's even something to be forgiven from.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.700]   I think a lot of people come in here tonight
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.240]   and you're like, "Hey, I'm a pretty decent person."
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.540]   If right now I were to ask you,
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.900]   "Hey, one to 10, 10, you are for sure,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.580]   if you were to die going home tonight,
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.540]   that you're going to heaven,
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.700]   what number do you think you are?"
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.320]   And I bet majority of people would be like,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.420]   "Hmm, that's a good question.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.420]   I would say I'm probably like a seven or an eight,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.860]   a 9.236."
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.860]   And a lot of different numbers might be represented.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.140]   Some of you are like, "I'm a two, I know it.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.720]   I ain't afraid to show it, I'm a two."
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.460]   Some of you are like, "I'm 50, 50."
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.520]   And all these different numbers would come in here.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.660]   But a lot of you, I think,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.980]   would be sitting in that sweet spot of like seven to nine
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.220]   because you would admit, "I'm a pretty good person.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.740]   I have never murdered someone.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.380]   I've never, I don't go around intentionally doing bad."
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.760]   And you aren't willing to admit
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.260]   that there's actually a huge problem.
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.380]   This Pharisee, look at what the verse says here.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.520]   "When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.280]   he said to himself in his mind,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   'If this man were a prophet,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.720]   he would know what kind of woman is touching him.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.680]   She's a sinner.'"
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.600]   If he's willing to think
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.060]   that this woman can't have access to be with Jesus
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.340]   because she's a sinner,
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.940]   that must mean that he thinks too highly of himself,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.480]   that there's something that he's comparing
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.140]   with her past and his past,
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.120]   and he sees himself as different than her,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.120]   and he must not see himself in much need of Jesus.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.260]   Probably because he isn't willing to admit
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.220]   that he's the problem.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.740]   And I think some of you come in here tonight
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.000]   and you're like, "Yeah, Jesus is a good guy.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.380]   Yeah, Jesus is a good thing.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.620]   This church stuff is a good thing,
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.380]   but like, I'm a good guy."
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.620]   And I'm here to tell you tonight, no one is good.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.280]   All of us have a huge problem,
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.820]   and it's time that you start actually seeing
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.220]   the weight of your problem
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.860]   because you can never see and have the understanding
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.060]   of true forgiveness until you first understand the weight
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.220]   and the reality of what you need forgiveness from,
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.840]   your sin, your problem.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.140]   Romans 3:23 puts it this way,
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.580]   "For all have sinned,"
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.740]   which means just anything you do to disobey God
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.300]   or displease God,
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.820]   something that you do against his word,
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.740]   something you do to serve yourself and not God,
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.340]   "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.060]   Key word, all.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.900]   Every single person in this room,
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.940]   every one of us have committed a sin.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.260]   Actually, you have something called a sin nature.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.620]   That means that when you were born,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.420]   I did not have to teach you how to sin.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.100]   I did not have to make you sin.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.220]   You simply just had sin in you.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.300]   When you're two and someone takes your toy
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.500]   and you start crying and screaming, "Mine, mine, mine,"
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.900]   it's because you're sinful.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.020]   We were born with a sin nature, every single one of us.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.900]   Therefore, every single one of us needs to start admitting
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.580]   that we have a serious problem.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.220]   Why?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.020]   Because God is sinless.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.380]   God cannot be in the presence of sin.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.540]   God is what we call holy,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.940]   meaning that he cannot be with sinful man.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.260]   When it says, "All have sinned and fallen short,"
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.520]   that means that fallen short means there's a separation.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.420]   There is something keeping us from God,
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.300]   and it is our problem.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.460]   It is sin.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.380]   Therefore, we need a solution.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.060]   Why?
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.140]   Because Romans 6, 23,
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.140]   "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.580]   I'm gonna stop there.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.980]   Just like in this story,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.940]   Jesus, 'cause the man is not seeing the gravity of his sin
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.180]   and his need for forgiveness,
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.000]   he tells, he doesn't condemn the Pharisee.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.840]   I love that, by the way.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.700]   He doesn't condemn him.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.540]   He loves him.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.580]   He teaches him something.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.640]   He uses this story.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.780]   He says, "Then Jesus told him this story.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.940]   "A man loaned money to two people.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.020]   "He gave two people money,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.420]   "500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other,
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.720]   "but neither of them could repay him."
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.560]   What does that tell me?
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.380]   What is Jesus illustrating here?
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.660]   There are some of you coming in here tonight,
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.740]   and you're like, "Yeah, I'm a pretty good person."
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.360]   But I'm telling you, from the white lie
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.500]   all the way to the abuse,
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.580]   all the way to the 12 years neck deep in pornography,
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.780]   all the way to snorting cocaine,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.340]   all the way to taking shots every weekend.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.900]   Some of you, you might be walking in here,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.980]   high tonight.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.460]   Some of you might be planning to hook up
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.700]   after the porch tonight.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.820]   Every single one of you,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.540]   whether you owe 50 or whether you owe 500,
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.440]   that's not the point.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.360]   The point is not how much you send or how little you send.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.500]   The point is this,
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.100]   but neither of them could repay him.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.140]   Neither one of them could pay their debt, what they owed.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.980]   And in the same way,
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.940]   whatever you think you owe tonight,
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.140]   how much you send, little or a lot,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.380]   you can't pay it.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.180]   You can't.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.380]   Therefore you have a major problem
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.300]   because I think if I were to ask everyone in this room,
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.900]   "Hey, when you die, do you wanna go to heaven?
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.660]   Do you wanna be with God?"
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.340]   I think majority of people here tonight would say, "Yes.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.340]   I wanna go to heaven.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.940]   I wanna see my grandpa one day.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.100]   I wanna be with my family.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.860]   I wanna be in eternity in a good place.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.820]   I wanna be with God."
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.660]   So here's the problem.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.140]   Left to yourself,
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.220]   you're sinful.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.620]   You need forgiveness.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.420]   You have a huge problem
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.940]   because God cannot be in the presence of sin.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.520]   So before I tell you about how you're forgiven,
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.020]   I want to make sure that all of us,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.740]   whether you've been free from your struggle for years,
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.780]   whether you're coming in here tonight
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.980]   and your problems are things like pride and lust,
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.100]   or whether you're coming in here and you're like,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.500]   "Man, I've done some things that I can't even say out loud.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.000]   I don't even know what the consequences would be."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.500]   You have a problem left to yourself
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.220]   and you need a solution.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.540]   And the solution is not you.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.940]   The solution is not anything that you can do.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.780]   Why?
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.900]   Romans 3 says this,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.500]   "As the scriptures say,
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.620]   'No one is righteous, not even one.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.420]   No one is truly wise.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.340]   No one is seeking God.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.020]   All have turned away.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.660]   All have become useless.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.940]   No one does good.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.900]   Not a single one
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.140]   left to ourselves,
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.660]   we can do no good because sin is in us.'"
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.820]   We're born sinful because of the very first sin
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.660]   of man and woman.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.540]   And since then, sin has been a pattern in humanity
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.460]   that separated us further and further from God.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.900]   We talked about it last week.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.700]   And so to understand, will I be forgiven?
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.380]   You have to first sit in the weight
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.980]   of what you need to be forgiven from.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.920]   You've come here tonight owing something.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.100]   I don't know if your story is I owe 50 or I owe 500,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.020]   but you owe something.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.260]   And like this story that Jesus told, you can't pay it.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.780]   You need a solution.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.540]   But before we get to that, just take a moment,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.040]   sit in the weight of what you need forgiveness from.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.480]   Because the deeper you understand your need,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.680]   the deeper you're gonna understand point two.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.520]   How can I know I will be forgiven?
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   First admit that I have a problem.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   And then second, accept Jesus as the solution.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.040]   Accept Jesus as the solution.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.200]   Part of my story is at seven years old, I prayed a prayer.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.700]   I came down front because my parents started going to church
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.840]   and I saw my parents come down to the front
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.960]   and pray to receive Christ.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.800]   So I came down the front and I prayed this thing
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   called a sinner's prayer.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.280]   And then immediately something in my mind started telling me
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.800]   okay, now because you're a Christian,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.240]   that means that you have to convince the world
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.160]   that you're a Christian.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.120]   You have to start doing a lot of things to come off perfect.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.880]   And I struggled with an image based reality,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.920]   a performance based reality for most of my life
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.400]   where I thought I have to convince everyone
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.160]   that look at JD and here's what I thought.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.040]   I thought, okay, if I want people to see
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.600]   that God is good, they have to see that JD is good.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.780]   I dismissed and I was not willing to admit
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.220]   that I had a problem.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.560]   So what did I do?
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.360]   Instead of boasting in my weakness, I hid it.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.200]   Anything that perceived me as weak,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.680]   anything that made me look sinful,
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.920]   anything that I didn't want people to know
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.240]   that people would judge me or think I'm weird, I hid it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.680]   Hiding your sin,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.640]   thinking that you're not worthy of forgiveness,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.720]   thinking that everyone else can get forgiveness
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.160]   except for you, battling this idea of perfectionism.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.240]   What you're saying with that is you think
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   that you can be the solution to your problem,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.540]   that you are the answer if you can just be good enough,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.720]   but you can't.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.680]   You're not the solution.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.320]   You have to see and accept Jesus as the solution.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.640]   Let's go back to the two characters of our story with Jesus.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.440]   But neither of them in verse 42,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.000]   neither of them could repay him.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   So he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.240]   Who do you suppose loved him more after that?
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.560]   Simon answered, I suppose the one
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.580]   whom he canceled the larger debt.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.120]   That's right, Jesus said.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.560]   And then he turned to the woman and he said to Simon,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.200]   Jesus is gonna start to do this like comparing
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.440]   and contrasting between Simon and the sinful woman.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.680]   He says, look at this woman kneeling here.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.960]   When I entered your home,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.260]   you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.160]   but she has washed them with her tears
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.680]   and wiped them with her hair.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.200]   You didn't greet me with a kiss,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.720]   but from the time I first came in,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.440]   she has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.360]   You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head,
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.560]   but she has anointed my feet with her rare perfume.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.080]   I tell you her sins and they are many have been forgiven.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.760]   So she has shown me much love,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   but a person who is forgiven little
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.840]   shows only a little love.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.480]   The Pharisee.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.240]   I think he's a lot like us.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.560]   I think we're a lot more like the Pharisee
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.600]   than we wanna admit.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.380]   We are willing to be about Jesus.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.820]   We are willing to put Jesus in our bio.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.700]   We might have a cross necklace, a cross tattoo,
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   a cross on our shirt.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.080]   We might come to the porch.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.260]   We might come to church.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.080]   We might go to church on Easter and Sunday.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.220]   And like, if people were to ask us,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.960]   we're like, yeah, I'm religious or yeah,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.940]   I believe in Jesus.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.780]   Yeah, I believe in Jesus.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.600]   Like I believe in Santa Claus.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.500]   I believe in Jesus.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.580]   Jesus is a good thing.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.020]   And you might know all these things.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.860]   You might know the stories.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.140]   You might know about Jesus, but I'm telling you,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.080]   I think a lot of us know about Jesus,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.000]   but we don't actually know the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.040]   We don't actually understand our need for Jesus.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.780]   And we don't actually see Jesus
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.760]   as a solution to our problem.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.600]   Why?
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.180]   Because when you face trials in life, you don't run to Jesus
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.540]   because you don't see him as the solution.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.780]   You run to yourself.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.000]   You run to pornography.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.840]   You run to going out with your friends.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.740]   You run to running back to that ex.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.560]   You run to drugs.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.360]   You run to that thing that you thought you would never do
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.580]   because something in you believes
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.200]   that that's the solution to my problem.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.340]   I do something, I feel bad about myself.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.840]   Therefore, I'm gonna go find the solution
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.280]   and you run to everything but Jesus.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.440]   And a lot of us, I think our major problem is,
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.160]   is we actually just run to ourself.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.680]   We think that there's something we can do
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.980]   that will make us good enough to go to heaven.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.240]   I'm gonna keep pounding this idea tonight
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   because I even struggle with this today.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.680]   And I've been walking with Christ for a few years now.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.260]   I still struggle to believe that there's nothing I can do,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.920]   that it's always been done for me.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.080]   You know who understood this?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.380]   The sinful woman.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.440]   When she saw her need, when she saw the gravity of her sin,
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.560]   she responded rightly to Jesus as a solution.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.700]   How do I know this?
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.160]   The Pharisee, the one who knew about God
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.600]   across the table pointing at her.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.680]   Was she concerned about that?
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.700]   No, she just wanted to be with Jesus.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.440]   That's what forgiven people do.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.120]   When you truly understand the solution to your problem
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.280]   and you see yourself as forgiven because of Jesus,
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.760]   because Jesus is the solution, you wanna be with him.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.120]   How is Jesus the solution?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   He illustrates it to this man
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.400]   by saying that there were two people
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.040]   that could not pay what they owe,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.840]   therefore the man in his kindness paid for them
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.960]   and canceled their debts.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.800]   And in the same way,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.560]   the reason why Jesus was illustrating the narrative
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.140]   with this man is because he was that man.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.280]   What he was saying to the Pharisee in the room was saying,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.700]   "Hey, I'm gonna be this man one day.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.520]   "But instead of just paying for 50 or 500,
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.480]   "I'm going to pay and cancel the debt
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.560]   "for all the sins of all the world."
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.160]   You wanna know, will you be forgiven?
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.780]   Yes, because Jesus left heaven, came down to earth,
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.480]   put on human skin and lived a perfect life,
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.880]   making him the perfect sacrifice
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.080]   because we could not do that and he went
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.000]   and carried every sin on the cross,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.180]   past, present and future.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.360]   Your sin today, he died for it and paid for it on the cross.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.240]   And not only that, but then when he died,
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.440]   they buried him for three days and after that, he rose again.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.600]   And when he rose again, he defeated sin.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.840]   And when he defeated sin,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.200]   that means that he said it's paid for.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.880]   There's nothing else you have to do.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   You don't have to come and pay your 50,
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.760]   you don't have to come pay your 500,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.080]   you don't have to come pay for that lie,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.440]   you don't have to pay for that night you hooked up
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.200]   with so-and-so, or the night you raped someone,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.480]   or the night that you were abused,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.920]   or that abortion, you don't have to pay for it
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.600]   because it's been paid for in Jesus.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.860]   You don't have to do anything else
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.840]   because it's all been done for you.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.480]   That's the beauty of Jesus.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.760]   That's how Jesus is the solution.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.520]   You're asking, will I ever truly be forgiven?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.560]   Yes, you will, because Jesus has done it.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.300]   He has paid what you could not pay.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.480]   That's what he's done for you.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.460]   He's telling this man the story because he is the story.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.560]   And what he did just a few chapters later when he died,
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   that story is still true for you today.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.680]   You don't have to wonder, will I ever be forgiven?
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.700]   You can be forgiven if you believe that this story is true.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.480]   Romans says, "If you confess with your mouth
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.440]   "that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.940]   "that God raised them from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.160]   "You will be forgiven.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.600]   "You will be loved."
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.800]   Not because of anything you can do.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.120]   The Pharisee understood religion.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.400]   The sinner understood relationship.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.680]   We're not about religion here at the porch.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.340]   Some of you, when people ask you,
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.120]   hey, what's your faith like?
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.720]   Are you a Christian or what are you?
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.500]   You're like, yeah, I'm religious.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.300]   Yeah, I'm a part of a religion.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   We don't do religion here because religion is about doing.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.220]   But that's what I'm telling you, there's nothing you can do.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.780]   It's about resting in all that's been done.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.960]   What we do here is we teach you how to have a relationship
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.760]   with the God who sent his son down to earth to die for you
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.920]   because he loves you.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.640]   We don't wanna create more smarter sinners
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.280]   who can come here and point across the table and say,
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.200]   well, at least I'm not that person, or I'm pretty good,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.440]   or at least I'm not that person.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.720]   We wanna create people who wanna come
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.040]   and sit at the feet of Jesus and pour out their all to him.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.060]   They say, yeah, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.920]   I know I'm a sinner, but that sin,
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.840]   it did not disqualify me, it actually qualified me.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   It made me the perfect candidate to come
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.860]   and sit at the feet of Jesus and receive his forgiveness.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.000]   That's what Jesus does for you.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.240]   That's the invitation he has for you tonight.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.680]   Quit coming and sitting around the table
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.960]   and knowing the things about God
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.760]   or hearing these stories and not being changed.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.200]   It's time to get at the feet of Jesus
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.640]   because you've been forgiven.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   You don't have to be set apart.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.480]   You can come be with him.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.080]   You can come be a part of what he's trying to do here.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.680]   And I think a lot of us,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.720]   we like the idea of forgiveness,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.320]   but it's actually a lot more harder for us to accept
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.340]   than we wanna admit.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.720]   Some of us, maybe the reason why forgiveness is hard for you
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.160]   because you don't actually believe,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.800]   like I've been saying, that you're worthy of it.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.320]   You're like the sinful woman that you come
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.520]   and you will be willing to admit that, yeah, I'm a sinner.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.000]   There's no hiding behind it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.520]   There's the Instagram pictures of me
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.040]   turning up on the weekends,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.240]   or the girls around here know my reputation,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.680]   or the guys know what I've done in my past,
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.160]   or my family knows that mistake I made.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.400]   You're like, yeah, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.660]   I'm not trying to deny that.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.280]   I think the difference between you and her
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.960]   is that you don't think you're worthy to be near Jesus.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.240]   And you don't see yourself as worthy.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.320]   You don't see Jesus as someone
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.560]   who actually wants to be with you.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.080]   And maybe because someone hurt you,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.200]   or maybe because someone rejected you after you sinned,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.240]   or after you made that mistake,
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.520]   maybe someone pushed you away.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.040]   That's not Jesus.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.360]   He says, you get to come.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.520]   You're worthy.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.680]   Every single person here tonight,
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.080]   if you don't hear me say anything else,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.920]   hear me say this,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.680]   I don't care what has happened to you in your past.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.080]   I don't care what you've done in your past.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.140]   I'm sorry, I do care what has happened to you.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.800]   I do care about you.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.600]   What I don't care about is the lies
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.080]   that the enemy will try to tell you.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.000]   What I don't care is not how he'll try to use that
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   to hold you back because what the reason why we say,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.640]   hey, I don't care, JD, about the things that you've done.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.920]   I don't care because I realized what's been done for me.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.880]   I am worthy of the love of God.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.600]   And so are you.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.740]   You might have a struggle with this
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.840]   because you haven't forgiven yourself.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.280]   First John 1, 9 says, if you confess your sins to him,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.840]   he is faithful and will forgive you of your sins
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.360]   and cleanse you from all wickedness.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.520]   James says, confess your sins to one another
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.820]   so that you may be healed.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.980]   Talk about it.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.760]   Forgive yourself.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.280]   Be willing to say, this is me, no more hiding.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.580]   I need to understand the forgiveness of Jesus.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.560]   And maybe some of you haven't accepted this
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.720]   and can't really understand the idea of being forgiven
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.020]   because you're not willing to forgive others.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.640]   Something has happened to you.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.400]   Someone has done something to you.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.880]   A parent abandoned you.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.440]   Someone abused you.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.240]   Something happened when you were out of control
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.380]   and someone hurt you deeply.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.620]   Someone cheated on you.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.840]   Someone left you.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.320]   I don't know what it might be,
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.960]   but unforgiveness has held you back for far too long.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.620]   And it's actually prohibiting you
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.800]   from understanding the forgiveness given to you by God
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.000]   because you think if I can't forgive them,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.500]   then how could God forgive me?
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.140]   And here's what Ephesians 4 says.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.220]   Instead, be kind to each other,
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.160]   tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.540]   just as God through Christ has forgiven you.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.360]   You want to know how you can have the strength
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.800]   to forgive that person?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.700]   Don't rely on your own strength.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.500]   Remember what God has done for you.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.200]   It's through his forgiveness that we can forgive.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.140]   Loved people, love people.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.960]   Forgiven people, forgive people,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.380]   not on their own strength,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.840]   but because we've been forgiven.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.580]   Life is too short to be held back by unforgiveness.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.320]   Some of you tonight need to pick up the phone
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.120]   and call someone and say, will you forgive me for blank?
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.640]   Some of you need to call that person,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.480]   and I know that sounds gut-wrenching to call them
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.800]   and say this,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.920]   but you need to call them and push past that hurt
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.480]   and say, I forgive you for blank
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.080]   because it has held you back long enough.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.240]   And it's time for freedom to take place tonight.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.280]   And to stop letting that hurtful action define you,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.400]   it's time to let go.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.620]   I started tonight with talking about the dude
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.420]   with the sign that uses his life to send a message.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.100]   And I want to challenge us tonight.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.880]   When you examine your life, is your life a message?
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.940]   What do you stand for?
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.640]   If right now people were to write a story
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.740]   about what you're about,
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.560]   the message your life is sending, what would it say?
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.340]   I think for some of us,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.120]   if we were to hold up our sign and send our message,
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.140]   this has defined us for a long time.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.780]   Some of you guys have been in church,
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.380]   you've done every program, you've done everything,
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.580]   and yet you still have found yourself years later,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.100]   still going back to this.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.800]   It's because you see yourself as this.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.600]   You think this is your story,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.620]   but in Jesus, you are this.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.780]   You are free.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.080]   You are not bound.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.260]   That does not define you.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.340]   You can be free.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.720]   Some of you, your sign would say this.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   Insecurity.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.100]   Others focus on what they think about you,
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.460]   and it's time to find your security in Christ.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.460]   Some of you, I don't know what happened to you,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.340]   but when this moment took place in your life,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.900]   and when you experienced abuse,
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.100]   I want to first say, I am sorry.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.120]   I am sorry that that thing happened to you.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.140]   Guys and girls, I am sorry it happened,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.020]   but because of the blood of Jesus,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.620]   that one night does not have to change your forever.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.440]   It does not have to change your future.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.280]   Because of Jesus, you can truly be washed clean.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   Some of you, like me, this word has defined you.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.620]   Control, image, being perfect,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.860]   thinking that you have to make someone proud,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.880]   or this is what it requires to be loved by God,
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.800]   to do and say all the right things.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.080]   You're not enough.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.560]   You'll never get it right.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.140]   But through Jesus, when Christ begins to define you,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.120]   and not yourself, you can be enough in Christ.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:46.500]   And I don't have time or enough cardboard to make a list
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.980]   and hold up a sign that represents everything
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.260]   that's holding you back from thinking that God wants
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.180]   to use you to send your life, to use your life,
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.820]   to declare of his goodness, despite your bad,
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.580]   and to use your life to send a message.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.680]   And so you right now just need to fill in the blank.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.580]   That thing that you think defines you,
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.820]   that self-righteousness that has kept you
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.820]   from needing more of God, you need to write it down.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.060]   That night, that thing you did today,
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.860]   you're like, man, I gotta sit way up here
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.640]   'cause I can't be near Jesus.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.900]   If anyone actually knew, they wouldn't want me here.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.200]   You need to write it down.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.100]   You need to see yourself as forgiven, forgiven in Christ.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.820]   Yeah, you have a problem, but God loved you so much,
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.740]   he did not want you to just stay in your problem.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.660]   He wanted you to be in heaven with him.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.580]   He wanted you to have a solution.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.340]   He wanted to be able to be near you, and it's Jesus.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.560]   It's through Jesus.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.840]   It's through his forgiveness.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.260]   It's through the blood that he shed for you
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.480]   that you can be forgiven.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.820]   And if you would start to understand
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.920]   the forgiveness that has been given to you
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   by the death of Jesus, you're gonna start to see your mess.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.160]   And start to understand that God can take your mess
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.600]   and turn it into a message.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.400]   And that's what he wants to do with people tonight.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.700]   He doesn't want perfect people.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.680]   He wants forgiven people.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.320]   People who will go out and tell people,
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   hey, I'm never gonna get it right.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   I'm broken, but those things don't define me.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.360]   Jesus defines me.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.680]   And if you would start to look at your past
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.720]   as something that's been forgiven through Christ,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.640]   there is no telling, listen to me,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.480]   there is no telling what God can do with your future.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.000]   Let's pray.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.560]   Father, we are so undeserving
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.280]   because of the problem that we have.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.440]   We are so undeserving because our sin is great.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.200]   We're so undeserving to be in the presence
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.160]   of your goodness, of your holiness.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.120]   But thank you that you take sinful people
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.440]   and you turn them through forgiveness into loved people.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.520]   Like you told Simon in this story,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.240]   those that have been forgiven much are able to love much.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.680]   And so I pray that tonight,
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.800]   these people would understand how much they've been forgiven
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.840]   so they can go out and send out that much love to the world
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.320]   through taking their mess and declaring a message
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.880]   that God has saved them from their sin.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.440]   Tonight, the person who does not believe
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   that they can truly be forgiven,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.520]   that they can truly be free,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.200]   I pray that they would see Jesus,
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.960]   they would see the price he paid.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.920]   They would understand that he came to take slaves,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.960]   to sin and make people free in Christ,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.880]   to take bound people, sinful people,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.200]   and make them forgiven and sent people.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.360]   And because of that, because you take our past
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.520]   and you tell a future story of your goodness
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.680]   just by our bat, we worship you.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.120]   We trust you.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.960]   We give our lives to you.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.840]   In that I pray, amen.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.240]   Let's respond in worship.
