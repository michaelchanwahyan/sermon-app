1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,560
 (audience cheering)

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,480
 - How's everybody doing?

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
 Good.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,540
 Good to be here with y'all today.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,540
 I appreciate that enthusiasm, that's nice.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,780
 I feel welcome.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,780
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,880
 If you don't know me, my name is Trip.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,720
 What?

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,600
 I don't know what you said.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,560
 What did you say?

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,660
 I can't decide if I should feel excited or mad or not.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,400
 What'd you say?

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
 Okay, I don't think he wants to tell me what he said.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,280
 I'm excited to be here.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,740
 If you don't know me, I'm Trip.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,080
 I'm a rapper and I'm also a pastor

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,380
 at Concord Church in South Oak Cliff.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,520
 So I love what y'all are doing here.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
 Excited to be able to be here and serve with y'all.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,120
 And I'm excited to get to preach the word tonight.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,660
 Anybody want to hear from God's word?

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,160
 (audience cheering)

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,460
 See, this is what I do, I pray.

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,960
 And then we'll get started.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,460
 Father, we come before you in Jesus' name.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,800
 Father, there's no other name under heaven

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,040
 by which we can be saved.

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,040
 God, the name of Jesus is all we have to lay claim to, Lord.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,180
 So we thank you for Jesus.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,180
 And we thank you for this time

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,760
 when we can hear from you and your word.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,120
 God, we pray you'd speak to us

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,520
 that this would be a good use of our time,

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
 that you would work in us, Lord,

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
 that we can know you more.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,180
 And we ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

39
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,160
 Amen.

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
 All right, well, I want to talk this evening.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,960
 I want to talk about fear.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
 I want to talk about fear.

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
 And fear is not one of those things that,

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,880
 when you think about preaching a sermon on fear,

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,080
 it's not one of those things where I'm wondering,

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
 is this the type of issue

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,040
 that will be relevant to people's lives?

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,840
 Are these the kind of people who have fears?

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,120
 Because fear is a part of all of our lives, right?

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
 There's not a single person in this room,

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,960
 you know, if I said, "Hey, if you've never struggled

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,460
 with any fear, raise your hand."

53
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,880
 No one would raise their hands unless they were liars

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
 and you need to repent.

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,180
 Fear is a part of all of our lives.

56
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,120
 When I think of fear,

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,320
 one of the things I think about is the IRS,

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,580
 because I have a particular situation.

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,120
 Stop laughing, let me tell you.

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,440
 So because I've been, for most of my life,

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
 my main employment has been being self-employed

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,620
 'cause I'm a rapper.

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,040
 That means that my taxes are not, you know,

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,160
 it doesn't just get taken out of my check, all right?

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,140
 No one pays me a salary, I'm self-employed.

66
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,040
 And so that means that there were some things

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,100
 about my taxes that were a little harder.

68
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,240
 And so me and my wife felt like,

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
 "Look, we need to get an accountant

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
 so this isn't so stressful and someone to take care of it."

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,400
 This was real early on in my career.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,040
 So we do that and then we feel like we can relax.

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
 We're like, "Good, it's taken care of."

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,940
 Until we started getting notices in the mail.

75
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,680
 Just so you know, if you get an envelope in the IRS,

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
 the IRS doesn't write you love letters.

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,200
 So if you get something from the IRS,

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
 it's usually not a good thing.

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,160
 And so we would get these notices that would say,

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
 "Hey, you didn't pay this, you owe this.

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
 Hey, you didn't pay this, you owe this."

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
 And so these things would pop up

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,260
 and we show it to our accountant like,

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,260
 "Hey, this is your whole job and I need you to do that."

85
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,600
 And they'd be like, "Oh, my bad."

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
 And then we'll take care of it.

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,840
 And this kept happening and we had to pay these late fees.

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
 And so it was around this time that the spirit of God

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,760
 revealed to me that I needed a new accountant.

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
 He said it to me clear as day.

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,280
 And so we got there.

92
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
 And now, because we've got this new accountant,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
 I got a good accountant, I got a good CPA,

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
 right, it means that I'm again at a place,

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,040
 taxes are still annoying, but it doesn't mean,

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,160
 it doesn't give the same stress and anxiety and fear.

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,700
 And here's what that shows me,

98
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,360
 is that the exact same situations

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,400
 can have a lot less fear depending on whose hands it's in.

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,880
 The exact same situations seem a lot scary

101
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,620
 when it's in the hands of somebody you trust.

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,120
 So I wanna talk about fear today.

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,240
 And here's why I think this matters

104
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,160
 and we should talk about this,

105
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
 because while fear is a part of all of our lives

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,200
 and it will be, fear doesn't have to rule our lives.

107
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,840
 Fear doesn't have to be the thing

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
 that reigns over all of our decisions,

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
 because this is what fear can do.

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
 Fear can make us begin to live in a way

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,600
 where we're so afraid of things

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,280
 that we make all of our decisions based on avoiding

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
 what we think is a worst case scenario,

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,040
 so that our life becomes about avoidance

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
 instead of actually moving forward

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
 towards something specific.

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,920
 And when we begin to think about who God made us to be

118
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,560
 and what God calls us to,

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,520
 he has not called us to live our lives

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,920
 just to avoid things we fear,

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,600
 he's called us to live actively in a way that honors him,

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,960
 right, and it's in accordance with who he made us to be.

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,880
 And so I want us to be able to do that

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,120
 and to know we can relax if we're in good hands.

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,280
 We're gonna look at Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10.

126
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
 So if you have a Bible, turn there,

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
 it should be on the screen.

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,920
 If you don't have a Bible, that is fine.

129
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,880
 Isaiah 41, 10, one of my favorite verses of scripture,

130
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,600
 and it's in these verses

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,320
 that God is gonna speak to us about that,

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
 he's gonna give us some promises that he has for us.

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
 In this section of Isaiah,

134
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,840
 Prophet Isaiah is speaking to God's people.

135
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,000
 God's speaking to his people,

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
 he's comforting them in the midst of captivity.

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
 What I want you to pay attention to

138
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,080
 is how committed God is to his people,

139
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,040
 how decisive he is, how confidently he speaks.

140
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,800
 Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10, this is what God's word says.

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,600
 It says, "So do not fear, for I am with you.

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,760
 "Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

143
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,460
 "I will strengthen you and help you.

144
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,360
 "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

145
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,200
 I'm gonna read it one more time.

146
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,040
 He says, "So do not fear, for I am with you.

147
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,480
 "Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,880
 "I will strengthen you and help you.

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,680
 "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,040
 That's the word of God.

151
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,600
 And God speaks his words of comfort

152
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
 to his people at the time,

153
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,200
 and he has these same words for us.

154
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,920
 And here's what I think the main point is.

155
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
 If you walk away with one thing,

156
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
 this is the main thing I want you to walk away with,

157
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
 it's this, that knowing God

158
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
 means we don't have to know fear.

159
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
 Knowing God means we don't have to know fear.

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,320
 And there are two reasons in the text that we'll look at,

161
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,160
 and we'll start with the first one is this.

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,800
 The first reason we don't have to know fear

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,980
 if we know God is God's presence.

164
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
 Number one is God's presence.

165
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,080
 Passage starts by saying, "Do not fear, for I am with you."

166
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
 Pretty straightforward.

167
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,560
 In this book, Isaiah is speaking to a fearful people.

168
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,080
 He's speaking to God's people, the nation of Israel,

169
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,880
 when God was mainly working with this particular nation

170
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,960
 of people that he was saving.

171
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
 And they always had to deal with threats,

172
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,880
 so they were always afraid.

173
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,000
 There were always these nations around them

174
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,080
 that were threatening to take them out,

175
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,440
 threatening to overtake them and destroy them.

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,760
 God had said that these nations definitely would overtake

177
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,920
 and destroy them if they didn't follow him and obey him.

178
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,400
 So they always felt like they were in danger.

179
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,320
 In the United States, we live in a kind of security

180
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,800
 and a lack of fear about our neighbors always attacking us.

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,900
 Israel didn't feel that way.

182
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,600
 They always thought an attack,

183
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,440
 them being taken into captivity,

184
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
 could be around the corner.

185
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,000
 And Isaiah, the prophet, writes ahead to God's people

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,720
 who will be held in captivity.

187
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,520
 They have a lot of reasons to be afraid,

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,240
 a lot of reasons to be insecure.

189
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,200
 They'll wonder if they can ever be safe again.

190
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,360
 They'll wonder if their God is still there,

191
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,600
 and God is kind enough to speak through his servant

192
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,360
 in advance, and God says to his prophet Isaiah

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,760
 very clearly to them, "Do not fear," or "Don't be afraid."

194
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
 And those are the exact same words

195
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,120
 he has to say to us today.

196
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,400
 Right, our situation may look amazing compared to theirs,

197
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
 but we don't have to be in danger of attack

198
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,640
 from other countries in order to be afraid.

199
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,280
 We don't have to be carried away from our homeland

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,940
 in order to be wrestling with fear.

201
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,920
 If I was to ask you, what is your biggest fear?

202
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,580
 What would you say?

203
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,720
 What is your biggest fear?

204
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,480
 And I don't mean when you're trying to be super Christian

205
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
 and someone's like, "Hey, what do you fear?"

206
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,120
 You're like, "I don't fear nothing but God, brother."

207
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,640
 Not talking about that, like actual real answers.

208
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,040
 Someone forgot to answer questions like humans

209
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
 after we got saved.

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,680
 Like really, what do you fear?

211
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,080
 There's a show, used to be on TV called Fear Factor,

212
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,880
 and the whole premise of this show

213
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,600
 was to play on people's fears.

214
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
 Whoever made that show was rude,

215
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,560
 but it's called Fear Factor.

216
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
 And so they would put people through all these crazy,

217
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,840
 scary challenges to see if you could make it.

218
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,320
 And stuff like sitting just in a pit of rats,

219
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,960
 or being trapped in a tunnel with tarantulas,

220
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,840
 or eating goat eyeballs, just like crazy things.

221
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
 Some of y'all are just done,

222
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
 you're not going to hear none of the rest of the sermon,

223
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
 you're so distracted.

224
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,960
 Many of our fears, though those things sound scary,

225
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,720
 and people signed up for that voluntarily,

226
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 but most of those things sound scary,

227
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,400
 but most of our biggest fears aren't things like that,

228
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,760
 it's stuff like losing a loved one.

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,560
 Those are the kinds of things that are our biggest fears.

230
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,400
 Maybe just being a failure,

231
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
 right, failing at the things we strive for.

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,400
 Disappointing the ones that love us and depend on us.

233
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,600
 Maybe our greatest fear is people finding out

234
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,840
 who we really are.

235
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,160
 We have fears.

236
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,760
 What would you say your biggest fear is?

237
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,120
 We all have these things in our lives,

238
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,920
 and it's interesting for God to tell them not to be afraid,

239
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,200
 it's interesting when anyone tells you not to be afraid,

240
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,160
 because no one really just decides

241
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
 that they want to be scared.

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
 I mean, when we are afraid,

243
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,080
 we don't normally think to ourselves,

244
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
 you know what, I could be courageous in this moment,

245
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,520
 but you know what, I don't do enough,

246
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,320
 be afraid of stuff.

247
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,840
 So you know what, that's what I'm going to do right now.

248
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,120
 It's not normally how fear sneaks up,

249
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,800
 it's not a decision we make,

250
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,760
 it's an emotion we feel that we can't just turn off.

251
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
 Here's what fear is, fear is when we dread something

252
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
 because we think it's a threat to us, right?

253
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
 Fear is when we're in a situation,

254
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,800
 we see something and we think something is a threat to us,

255
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
 so we dread that.

256
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,760
 So we feel fear when we get a phone call late at night

257
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,600
 'cause we're afraid,

258
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,480
 we don't know what that call could be about.

259
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
 We fear when we're driving and someone slams on their brakes

260
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,000
 right in front of us and we almost rear end them, right?

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,520
 We fear we'll get injured, but how about this,

262
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
 what if that happens, somebody stops real quick

263
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,640
 and you got a slam on your brakes, you're afraid,

264
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,960
 and you got a friend riding with you on the passenger side

265
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,100
 and right as you're about to do that, they just do this,

266
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,800
 they say, "Don't be afraid!"

267
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,280
 (audience laughing)

268
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
 Would that help you?

269
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,780
 No, probably not.

270
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,040
 That's probably just going to make,

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,600
 we all got friends and when they ride with you,

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,060
 they just overreact to everything

273
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,520
 and it's like, you almost made me have an accident

274
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,000
 by your overreactions.

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
 Just open the door and roll out if you're going to be like that.

276
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,760
 It wouldn't help, just to scream, "Don't be afraid,"

277
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,600
 and the reason that wouldn't do anything

278
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,680
 is because, right, this is not the situation at hand here.

279
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,480
 You can't just scream, "Don't be afraid,"

280
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
 but that's what God tells his people

281
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
 right here in this terrifying situation.

282
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
 He says, "Don't be afraid,"

283
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,840
 so what's the difference between your friend

284
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
 who's not helpful and between God saying it?

285
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,280
 Here's the difference, is that God tells us

286
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,840
 why we shouldn't be afraid.

287
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,760
 He's not just screaming pointless stuff at us

288
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,680
 and this isn't just some random person

289
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,200
 telling us not to be afraid.

290
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,820
 Our friend, it's not someone who can't do anything

291
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,400
 about the situation, this is the God of the universe

292
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
 who is sovereign over your situation.

293
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,520
 This is the God of the universe who already knows

294
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,320
 what's going to happen in your situation.

295
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,040
 This is not a random friend who's observing

296
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,320
 what's happening along with you, this is God.

297
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,820
 So that when God tells us not to be afraid,

298
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,460
 not only is it different because of who's speaking,

299
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,260
 but also because he gives us reasons

300
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
 that we shouldn't be afraid.

301
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,080
 'Cause fear isn't just something we can just turn off

302
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,240
 like a light switch, but fear dies

303
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,920
 when the perception of danger goes away.

304
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
 Fear can only thrive when the perceived danger seems real,

305
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,500
 when the threat seems real.

306
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,220
 So God is talking to these people and he's saying,

307
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,940
 "Look, I know it looks really bad,

308
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,200
 "but I need you to reassess the situation.

309
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
 "I need you to rethink about this threat,

310
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
 "about this in front of you."

311
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
 I'll give you an example.

312
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,680
 A few years ago, I was in D.C.,

313
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,220
 I was an elder at a church there

314
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,980
 and we were going on this retreat.

315
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,640
 They had this thing they called the Elder Olympics.

316
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,440
 So we were doing good stuff like prayer

317
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,800
 and spiritual things, but we also were just doing fun stuff.

318
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,260
 So they called it the Elder Olympics,

319
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,060
 it's just a way for people to just play some games.

320
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,280
 And it was a list of stuff you could sign up for

321
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,320
 and I was looking at the list and I was like,

322
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
 I'm only good at, I'm only good at very few things.

323
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,960
 I was like, terrible at that, not good at that,

324
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,300
 I don't respect people who do that.

325
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,520
 I'm going through this list and I see basketball on there

326
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,880
 and I love basketball, I'm not great at it,

327
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,260
 but I looked around the room, I was like,

328
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
 I think I got this.

329
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,180
 So I signed up for that and I was feeling good.

330
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,880
 And then there was another dude named Jeremy

331
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,660
 who they were like, "You remember what Jeremy

332
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,640
 "was doing last year?"

333
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,760
 I was like, "Huh?"

334
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,240
 And they just started talking him up

335
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,700
 like he was just the second coming of Michael Jordan.

336
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
 I started to feel fear, I felt confident before,

337
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,380
 but now I began to feel fear because I knew about,

338
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,340
 I saw something completely differently, I reassessed.

339
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,840
 Now we don't need to talk about how it ended up,

340
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,640
 we got the point of the illustration.

341
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,080
 We're just saying, fear is based on how threatening

342
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,940
 something seems to us.

343
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,560
 That's how we, that's what decides whether or not

344
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,480
 we'll be afraid and what God is doing here to his people,

345
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
 it's kind of like the opposite of trash talk.

346
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,080
 You know what trash talk is?

347
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,720
 Like dudes are playing basketball and you know,

348
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,580
 you're just trying to get in somebody's head

349
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,960
 and you're like, "You ain't going to make this shot.

350
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,180
 "You're not good, right?

351
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,580
 "You're probably going to lose your job."

352
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,880
 Whatever comes to mind, you just try to get in their head

353
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,840
 and throw them off their game.

354
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,120
 You shouldn't say that on the court, that's too much.

355
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,380
 But you're trying to get in their head to throw them off

356
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,460
 so they won't be able to succeed, right?

357
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,120
 You're trying to say there's bigger threats in mind,

358
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,100
 you should be afraid.

359
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,220
 What God does here with his people is kind of the opposite

360
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,540
 of trash talk where he says, "You are in a really difficult

361
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,120
 "situation and I want to whisper things to you.

362
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,440
 "I want to say things in your ear that change the way

363
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,500
 "you see this threat and I want you to know

364
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,460
 "that this threat doesn't have to overcome you.

365
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,100
 "You don't have to see this threat in that same way."

366
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,000
 God is whispering, in the middle of whatever kind of stuff

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,440
 we have going on that's scary, God is whispering

368
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,220
 comforting things to us in our ears to build us up,

369
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,740
 to give us what we need to persevere and he's telling us

370
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,020
 in the midst of difficulty, reassess the situation,

371
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,400
 do not be afraid.

372
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,200
 And don't get me wrong, as a pastor, I understand

373
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,880
 that in a room this big, there are so many people

374
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,840
 with all different kinds of issues going on

375
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,800
 and all different kinds of fear.

376
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
 We have family issues and health issues and money issues

377
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
 and emotional issues and issues, you know,

378
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,560
 you can't figure out whether or not you actually believe

379
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,920
 in Jesus or not or whether or not you still believe

380
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,160
 the Bible and you're afraid of what that might mean for you.

381
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,280
 I know there's a lot of different fears,

382
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,000
 but God is saying right here, when we are overwhelmed

383
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,420
 with fear, we should reassess.

384
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,400
 And to think about the truth that I don't have

385
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,080
 to be afraid, I don't have to live under the tyranny

386
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,240
 of fear, is a comforting thought.

387
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,680
 And I want to know what it would look like

388
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,560
 to actually walk in that.

389
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,760
 So I want you to ask yourself what kinds of scary situations

390
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,840
 in your life that you need to reassess.

391
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,800
 What kind of things in your life do you need to reassess

392
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
 in light of who God is?

393
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,200
 Somebody right now might be thinking, though,

394
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
 they might think, now, true,

395
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,760
 fear is a really natural thing,

396
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 so why are you talking about it like it's something

397
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
 we can just get rid of or as if it's something

398
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
 that's really bad?

399
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,600
 You might say, true, why does the Bible sound

400
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,760
 so negative about fear?

401
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,080
 Because fear comes up in the Bible a lot.

402
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,080
 The command, do not fear, is actually the most common

403
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,800
 command in all of the Bible.

404
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 God is saying this all the time.

405
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
 Like Joshua 1, 9, where God says,

406
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,400
 have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous,

407
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,680
 do not be frightened, do not be dismayed,

408
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,180
 for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.

409
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,360
 Bible's always telling people don't be afraid,

410
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,760
 but since fear is such a natural response

411
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,680
 to difficult situations, why does Scripture talk about it

412
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,200
 so negatively, and I'll say this to give you

413
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 the quick answer, is fear can show our lack of trust in God.

414
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,760
 And again, I don't mean just being scared

415
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,960
 when you're about to crash your car,

416
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,320
 that's a good kind of fear that can save your life.

417
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,880
 In that sense, fear is good,

418
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,220
 but there are different kinds of fear.

419
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,600
 So not every kind of fear is sinful.

420
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,840
 Here's when fear is actually sinful.

421
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,080
 Fear turns to sin when it comes from unbelief

422
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,520
 or when it leads you to disobedience.

423
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,400
 Right, so scared you're gonna crash your car,

424
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,560
 not sinful fear.

425
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,720
 If you're afraid to be honest about your faith in Jesus

426
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,800
 because you think someone will look at you differently,

427
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,760
 that would be sinful fear because it has led to disobedience.

428
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,360
 If you're afraid,

429
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,520
 if you're afraid of not getting that job opportunity

430
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,880
 because you don't trust that God could provide for you

431
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
 any other way or open any other doors,

432
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,040
 that would be sinful fear.

433
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,440
 Fear turns sinful when it comes from unbelief

434
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
 or when it leads to disobedience.

435
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,680
 So the Bible is calling us not to fear

436
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,040
 in a way that distrusts God.

437
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,480
 We shouldn't fear things more than we fear God.

438
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,600
 So many of our daily fears

439
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,920
 do have to do with what other people think, though.

440
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,240
 I mean, we think about a lot of the stuff that we fear.

441
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,660
 It has to do with what other people think,

442
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,660
 and it's because we fear people more than we fear God.

443
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,360
 At the end of the day,

444
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,040
 the way that what people think of us

445
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,480
 matches up with what God thinks of us

446
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,880
 and what God has promised us,

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
 it just looms larger in our minds.

448
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,640
 So that even if we would say God is bigger,

449
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
 we treat those things like they're bigger than him.

450
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,400
 And we pay such close attention to our fears

451
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,040
 because they expose our unbelief.

452
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,640
 We think God is smaller than the other things

453
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,920
 that are facing us.

454
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
 And here's the thing that happens.

455
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,280
 Our response in a trial or something scary,

456
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,120
 it's kind of like an X-ray.

457
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,800
 You know, you have an X-ray, something's wrong,

458
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,560
 your leg hurts, you go to the doctor,

459
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,160
 they can do an X-ray and tell you if something's broken,

460
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
 and it can come back good, it's all good,

461
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
 or you can see that there's a fracture.

462
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,520
 What our trials do is they expose

463
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
 what's actually happening in our souls.

464
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,120
 The way that we respond in difficult situations

465
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
 shows what's inside.

466
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,560
 There may be this kind of faith

467
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,960
 that sees God for who he is,

468
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,040
 or there could be a lot of fear in there

469
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,960
 that sees God as a lot smaller than others.

470
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
 So we should pay attention to our trials.

471
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,480
 We should pay attention to our fears

472
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,920
 'cause they show us who we really are.

473
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,680
 We should do the same thing for one another.

474
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
 We should pay attention to what's going on

475
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
 in those tough situations.

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
 But we want to turn from fear

477
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
 'cause fear is giving our trials

478
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,880
 more credit than they deserve.

479
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,360
 Fear is giving our circumstances

480
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
 more credit than they deserve.

481
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,000
 So God says reassess, and he gives them a reason.

482
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
 I know you said, "Tripp, you said there were reasons."

483
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
 Here's the reason he gives them.

484
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,240
 Because I am with you, which sounds really nice

485
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
 to think that God is with us.

486
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,640
 Doesn't that sound nice?

487
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,720
 God is with us, but what does that really mean

488
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
 for God to be with us?

489
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
 In the Bible, when the Bible talks about God being with us,

490
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,200
 it means more than just he's present.

491
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,040
 'Cause the Bible's clear,

492
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,960
 God is present everywhere at the same time.

493
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
 He's always present.

494
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,240
 So it must mean more than just that.

495
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,000
 Because sometimes somebody just being present

496
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
 doesn't really help that much.

497
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,080
 So if you was in school and a bully said

498
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,560
 he was going to beat you up and you told the teacher,

499
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
 and you was like, "He said he's going to beat me up

500
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,560
 "at 3.30," and she was like, "All right, I'll be there."

501
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,800
 And then she shows up and she watches.

502
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,520
 That's not really helpful.

503
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,160
 It's like you was here, but.

504
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,520
 So when God talks about, when he promises that he's with us,

505
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,240
 when the Bible talks about God being with us,

506
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
 it doesn't just mean that he's present.

507
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,160
 When the Bible talks about God being with us,

508
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,400
 it also means he's going to work on our behalf

509
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,280
 according to his promises.

510
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,040
 So when the Bible talks about God being with us,

511
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,360
 it means he's committed to work on our behalf

512
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
 according to his promises.

513
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,240
 We know that from passages like this, Genesis 39.

514
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
 It says, "The Lord was with Joseph,

515
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,460
 "and he became a successful man

516
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,560
 "and was in the house of his Egyptian master,

517
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,800
 "the Lord was with him and caused all that he did

518
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,160
 "to succeed in his hands."

519
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,280
 Jeremiah 1.19, it says, "They'll fight against you,

520
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,160
 "but they shall not prevail," why?

521
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,680
 "For I am with you," declares the Lord, "to deliver you."

522
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,320
 So when the Lord talks about being with us,

523
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,920
 he's saying, "I am committed to you to work for your good

524
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,800
 "according to my promises."

525
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 He's committed to us.

526
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
 Now this doesn't mean that God is just going to help you

527
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,920
 win every military battle.

528
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,040
 That's not what that means.

529
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,920
 We got to think in terms of God's promises to us.

530
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,760
 So you shouldn't just talk crazy to your boss tomorrow,

531
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
 like, "God is with me though, so I'm good.

532
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,680
 "This is not what this is.

533
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,160
 "Don't blame me for your termination," all right?

534
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,440
 We have to think in terms of God's promises to us.

535
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,280
 We have to think about,

536
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,760
 'cause God made commitments to Israel

537
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
 that have to do with these battles.

538
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
 What promises has God made to us

539
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
 that can remind us what it means

540
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,680
 that he's with us in difficult times?

541
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,640
 Just to give you some,

542
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,160
 God has promised never to leave or forsake us.

543
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,240
 So when we have a particular fear about relationships

544
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,000
 and we allow those to kind of lord over our whole life,

545
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
 we should remember we have a God

546
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,360
 who's promised never to leave or forsake us.

547
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,080
 God has promised to give us eternal life.

548
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,640
 God has promised to resurrect our bodies.

549
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
 God has promised to work all things for our good.

550
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,400
 God has promised to wipe away all of our tears one day.

551
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,160
 God has promised to pour out riches of grace on us

552
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,440
 for all of eternity.

553
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
 God has promised to give us strength

554
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
 in difficult situations.

555
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,200
 God has promised to care for us through his people.

556
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 God has promised so many precious things to us.

557
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,280
 So when we think about the things that we fear,

558
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
 when we remember, boy, I have a God who's with me,

559
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
 who's made amazing promises to me,

560
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,320
 that should make us reassess those threats.

561
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,960
 There's no way you can go that God won't be with you.

562
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,720
 And it's a tough season where we feel like we're alone.

563
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,800
 But God is saying he's with us.

564
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,040
 He'll never leave us.

565
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,800
 Next part of the verse is really similar.

566
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,400
 He says, "Be not dismayed, for I am your God."

567
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
 Right?

568
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,760
 So there's a call not to be anxious.

569
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,000
 And then he says, "Because I'm your God."

570
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,080
 You know, there's no end of verse.

571
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,160
 He doesn't say, "Don't be afraid,

572
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,880
 "'cause you're better than that."

573
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,360
 He doesn't say, "Hey, bro, don't be afraid, man up."

574
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,880
 These are not the things that he says.

575
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,680
 Or, "You got this."

576
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,160
 Instead of pointing to you and what you can do,

577
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,640
 when God says, "Don't be afraid," he points to himself.

578
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,880
 He says, "Don't be afraid, not 'cause you're so amazing.

579
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,160
 "Don't be afraid, because I'm with you."

580
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
 Right?

581
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
 He doesn't say, "Don't be afraid, 'cause you're amazing."

582
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,280
 He says, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I am your God."

583
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
 And it's trust in God that kills off sinful fear.

584
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,300
 Faith in God suffocates sinful fear.

585
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,480
 How could it not?

586
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
 And, you know, I don't have enough time to go into this,

587
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,680
 but just Isaiah 41 happened right after Isaiah 40,

588
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,920
 where God points to all these amazing things

589
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,480
 about his character.

590
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,640
 Right, where Isaiah is just pointing to how incredible he is.

591
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,840
 He's so big, we're like grasshoppers in his sight.

592
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,680
 He sits over the circle of the globe.

593
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,160
 Right, the things that seem huge to us are tiny to him.

594
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,620
 And right after that, God is saying,

595
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,600
 "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."

596
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,900
 And especially the Israelis saying,

597
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,140
 "Not those idols of the other nations,

598
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,660
 "not the false gods of the other nations.

599
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,960
 "They said they're going to help them defeat you."

600
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,440
 He says, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."

601
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,760
 And to us, he may say, "Not the money

602
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,840
 "that you've been depending on

603
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,920
 "and made the center of your life."

604
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,040
 He's saying, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I'm your God."

605
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,760
 Not those relationships that you think

606
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,080
 are the only thing keeping you afloat.

607
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,280
 He's saying, "Don't be afraid, 'cause I am your God."

608
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,840
 And so many of us, it's so difficult to survive

609
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,000
 in fearful situations,

610
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
 because we've made other things our gods.

611
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
 We've built our lives on things

612
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
 that are not strong enough or mighty enough to hold us up.

613
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,320
 And God is saying, "I am your God."

614
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,560
 And that is a beautiful truth,

615
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,960
 because there's no one like our God.

616
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,920
 Right, it's scary to remove other things

617
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,720
 from the center of your life and to put God there,

618
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,360
 because it's vulnerable,

619
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,800
 there's stuff that you like about how things are,

620
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,360
 but it's always a good trade-off.

621
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,760
 God's stronger than those things.

622
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,480
 He's more faithful than those things,

623
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,120
 more loving than those things,

624
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,240
 and a stronger commitment to us than those things.

625
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
 God is saying, "Don't be afraid, I'm your God."

626
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,680
 Knowing God means you don't have to know fear.

627
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,480
 First reason was God's provision.

628
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,800
 Very briefly, the second reason was God's presence.

629
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,720
 Very briefly, the second reason is God's provision.

630
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,920
 God's provision.

631
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,360
 When me and my wife got married,

632
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,720
 and my wife is here tonight, say, "Hey, Jess."

633
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 - Hey, Jess.

634
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,080
 - When we got married, a lot of people said,

635
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,760
 "Man, your wedding was beautiful, especially the vows."

636
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
 People just kept saying the vows were amazing.

637
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
 And I don't think it was because we said anything

638
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
 especially amazing.

639
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,400
 I think just the concept of vows is amazing.

640
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
 You're saying all these things that you promised

641
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,000
 to do for somebody for the rest of your life,

642
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,200
 not even knowing what they're gonna be like.

643
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,240
 I like you now, what you gonna be like in 10 years, though?

644
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,480
 But you're saying, "Look, no matter what,

645
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,120
 "richer or poorer, I'm with you."

646
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,640
 And this is almost, so the first part

647
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,600
 is almost like God's pronouncement of who he is to us,

648
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,560
 I'm your God.

649
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,680
 The second part is almost like God's vows,

650
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,800
 what he is promising to do for us

651
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,240
 based on this relationship he has with us.

652
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,040
 The difference is when my vows, when I got married,

653
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
 I also promised, I said,

654
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,200
 and for all the times I failed these things,

655
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,080
 I will, I promise to try to repent and do better.

656
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,840
 We have a God who's perfectly faithful

657
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,000
 and never have to repent and try to do better

658
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,560
 because he will keep them to perfection.

659
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,360
 And here's what he vows to do.

660
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,120
 He says, "I will strengthen you.

661
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,880
 "I will help you.

662
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,400
 "I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

663
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
 What a guy.

664
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,800
 These weak people have gotten themselves into trouble

665
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,120
 because of their disobedience.

666
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,800
 God is saying, "I will help you.

667
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
 "I'll strengthen you, I'll uphold you."

668
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,560
 And he's making that promise to us.

669
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,120
 And I don't know about you, I really,

670
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
 I don't always like when people offer me help

671
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,080
 because I feel like it's implying that I need it

672
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,360
 and I don't like to seem like I need help.

673
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,440
 Right, so you feel like I'm supposed to take the trash out

674
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,960
 and I'm about to do it and my wife reminds me

675
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,360
 right before I do it, I'm like, "I was gonna do it.

676
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,800
 "I didn't need you to say that, I got this."

677
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,080
 It implies that we need help.

678
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,520
 Right, it implies that we're weak.

679
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,360
 God is implying that we're weak when he says,

680
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,640
 "I'll help you, I'll strengthen you, I'll uphold you."

681
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,000
 He's implying that we need help, right?

682
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
 That we're weak and need to be strengthened.

683
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,200
 That we're about to fall and we need to be upheld.

684
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,920
 And look, at different seasons of our life,

685
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,720
 more times than others, we are afraid to admit

686
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,480
 or acknowledge or see our own weakness.

687
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,560
 And it's very hard for us to not give in to fear

688
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,160
 'cause all over our lives, when we are determined

689
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,120
 to only depend on our own strength,

690
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,000
 I just want you to know, if you think your strength

691
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
 is gonna get you through everything,

692
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,640
 you will live a life full of fear

693
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,920
 because you will constantly run into situations

694
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,360
 that you cannot possibly get through on your own.

695
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,160
 It's okay to admit our own weakness.

696
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,440
 And this is one of the hard things,

697
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
 it's difficult about just beginning to follow Jesus at all.

698
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,880
 Right, I know there's some of us here today

699
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,680
 who are wondering, "Should I follow Jesus?

700
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
 "I'm trying to figure this out."

701
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,680
 And one of the hard things is you're saying,

702
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,360
 "Look, actually, the way I've been doing this

703
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,440
 "hasn't been working that well and I need God to show me."

704
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,640
 The good news is is that God doesn't only tell us

705
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,720
 we're weak, he tells us we're weak

706
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,960
 as he promises to strengthen us.

707
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,080
 And he's saying, "I'll strengthen you, help you, uphold you."

708
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,640
 All of us are weak in different ways

709
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,000
 and it helps us to understand, when God does this,

710
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,120
 it helps us to understand our role in a relationship.

711
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,760
 He's the rescuer, we are the damsel in distress.

712
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,000
 He's the one that swoops in to save the day,

713
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
 we're the ones who need a rescuer.

714
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,240
 He's the firefighter coming to put it out,

715
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,760
 we're the kids inside who need to be snatched.

716
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,280
 And God has promised to be with us, right?

717
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,640
 So this means something that he'll strengthen us,

718
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,960
 this means something for those of us

719
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,560
 who feel especially emotionally weak,

720
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,160
 who feel like there's a cloud over our heads at all times,

721
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,880
 God is saying he will strengthen us.

722
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,760
 For those of us who are physically weak,

723
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,400
 who struggle to get through our days,

724
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,360
 God is promising to help us.

725
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,080
 For those of us who are spiritually weak,

726
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
 aren't even sure where we are,

727
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,960
 wondering if we can still believe in Jesus for another day,

728
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,040
 God will uphold us, he'll give us what we need

729
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
 to keep persevering and he's promised it.

730
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,840
 And I love how he promises to do it,

731
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
 he says, "By his righteous right hand."

732
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,480
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to send a friend of mine

733
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,720
 "to help you."

734
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,820
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to send some really strong people

735
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,180
 "I know to try to uphold you."

736
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,760
 He says, "I will do it with my righteous right hand."

737
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,120
 That God is willing to get in the field with us

738
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
 and uphold us himself.

739
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,640
 I mean, this is part of the beauty of the gospel of Jesus.

740
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,040
 That when we had sinned against him in such a way

741
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,700
 that we were separated from him,

742
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,880
 God didn't send angels to die for us,

743
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,120
 God put on human flesh and came himself.

744
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,440
 He said, "I'll take care of this."

745
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,240
 This is part of the beauty of the gospel,

746
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,760
 it's part of the beauty of who God is.

747
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,360
 And here too, he says, "I will uphold you

748
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,780
 "by my righteous right hand."

749
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,220
 My wife and I were talking about fear

750
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,980
 when I was studying this text.

751
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,620
 And we agreed that a lot of times we fear God,

752
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,260
 not because we actually think that those things

753
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,200
 are bigger or stronger than God,

754
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,700
 but a lot of times we fear situations

755
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,620
 because we know that even though God is strong,

756
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,380
 but sometimes he allows things to happen

757
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,620
 that are going to be hurtful.

758
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,420
 So it's not enough to say, "Oh, God is stronger,"

759
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,780
 because yeah, I know he's stronger,

760
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,140
 but sometimes he allows things to happen

761
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,260
 that we don't like.

762
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,220
 And so just because you believe that God is in control

763
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,420
 doesn't mean you're not guilty of sinful fear.

764
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,940
 But I want to remind you, God can,

765
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,380
 and he will give you the strength that you need

766
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,780
 to be able to persevere through that.

767
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,780
 If we know God, we don't have to know fear.

768
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,380
 And he can work up that trust in him and how good he is.

769
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,100
 I wish there were like some magic,

770
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,980
 if you're like, "Man, how can I learn to trust God more

771
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,260
 "even in the midst of my fear?"

772
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,060
 I wish I had like some magic solutions,

773
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,940
 like, "Hey, click your heels together three times

774
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,260
 "and listen to a Bieber song and you'll be good."

775
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,460
 I wish it was that easy.

776
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,560
 It's not, but I don't have any magic solutions,

777
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,380
 but there are these things that the Bible tells us

778
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,060
 about all the time that don't really sound

779
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,940
 that special or impressive,

780
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,300
 but are the things that scripture sends us to

781
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,980
 to build up our trust in God.

782
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,740
 One of them is his word.

783
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,500
 That's how we see what he's like,

784
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,740
 when we look in his word.

785
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,380
 And when we look in this book

786
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,260
 and we see how time after time after time

787
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,120
 he's been faithful to keep his promises,

788
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,380
 time after time after time he has gone before people

789
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,260
 who seem too weak for the situation,

790
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,660
 time after time after time he has blown us away

791
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,860
 with his amazing power and grace and love.

792
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
 When we see that stuff in his word,

793
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,540
 this is not just a book full of stories,

794
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,100
 this is how we see God.

795
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,140
 If you miss your friend, you forget what your friend is like,

796
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,780
 you spend time with your friend.

797
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,460
 This is not just a book of some good stories to inspire us,

798
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,380
 this is where we meet with God.

799
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,300
 Well, we're reminded what he's like.

800
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,460
 I wanna encourage you also to pray.

801
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,980
 I can't tell you the number of times

802
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,000
 when something seemed so much bigger than me,

803
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,080
 but when I was forced to just be quiet

804
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,220
 and then just talk to God, I was reminded how big he is.

805
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,020
 And I was reminded I get to hand it over to him.

806
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,140
 Another thing that helps us with this is other people

807
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,820
 who are trying to walk after Jesus,

808
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,500
 who are also striving in the same way.

809
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,620
 Friends who, it's good to have friends who will say,

810
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,580
 "Man, look, I just wanna be honest.

811
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,200
 "I think you are sinfully afraid right now.

812
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,300
 "And I think you're treating that

813
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
 "like it's bigger than Jesus."

814
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,100
 You need some friends who will say that kind of stuff to you

815
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,660
 where you would just be real mad at them that night,

816
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,680
 but then you text them like, "You was right, bro."

817
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,360
 You need those friends.

818
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,580
 So it was only like friends who would just be like,

819
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,160
 "You know what, I'm mad too,

820
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,180
 "I'm more afraid than you are, bro."

821
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,140
 Like we only want friends who will never say anything hard

822
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,860
 to us or challenge us.

823
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,980
 One of the ways that we're able to be reminded

824
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,500
 that God is bigger than our stuff

825
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,680
 is sometimes we can't see it and we need friends to say,

826
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,660
 "Hey, as a reminder," not in a self-righteous way,

827
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
 like I struggle with fear too.

828
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,600
 Let me tell you what God reminded me the other day

829
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,900
 when I was wrestling with fear.

830
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,300
 He reminded me that he's much bigger than this.

831
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,740
 We need friends like that

832
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,760
 to help us wrestle through these things.

833
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,020
 If we know God, we don't have to know fear.

834
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,740
 And one of the most amazing pictures of this,

835
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,020
 that God means this,

836
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,560
 because sometimes when God makes a promise like that,

837
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,700
 look, you don't have to be afraid 'cause I'm your God,

838
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,660
 I'll strengthen you, uphold you, help you.

839
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,180
 A lot of times when people make big, grand promises,

840
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,460
 we wonder, can I really believe them?

841
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,020
 Right, is this the kind of person

842
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,540
 that's actually gonna follow through?

843
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,860
 Or we might say, "Look, that sounds nice,

844
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,380
 "but I need some action to show me."

845
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,300
 Well, let me tell you, one of the ways that we know

846
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,980
 that this is the kind of God who means it

847
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,300
 when he says, "I'm with you,"

848
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,040
 who means it when he says, "I will strengthen you,

849
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,460
 "I will uphold you,"

850
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
 the clearest picture of God's strength

851
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,900
 in the midst of our weakness,

852
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,580
 as we already talked about, is the gospel of Jesus.

853
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,580
 The good news, a story about the fact

854
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,500
 that we were desperately lost,

855
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,300
 there was no way we could get ourselves back to God,

856
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,300
 that we are broken, this is why our world is such a mess,

857
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,580
 but that God, even though he's the one we sinned against,

858
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,460
 said, "I'm gonna put on human flesh,"

859
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,780
 and though they were too weak to actually obey me,

860
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,620
 you know what, "I'm gonna put on human flesh,

861
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,200
 "and I'm gonna show 'em how it's done.

862
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,360
 "I'm gonna live the perfect life, I'm gonna love,

863
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
 "I'm gonna live a life of justice and mercy,

864
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,000
 "I'm gonna live a life of forgiveness,

865
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,700
 "I'm gonna show them how it's done,

866
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,740
 "and then, even though I live the perfect life

867
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,180
 "that deserves rewards,

868
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,460
 "I'm gonna take the punishment for them.

869
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,520
 "Now, I'm gonna take all the justice that they deserve,

870
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,900
 "but put it on me instead."

871
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,400
 Right, so sometimes we'll be like,

872
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,740
 "Man, but how do I know God loves me?"

873
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,340
 The Bible's really clear.

874
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,700
 The way that we know God's love,

875
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,660
 he displayed his love for us,

876
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,460
 and that while we were still sinners, Jesus died for us.

877
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,260
 Then it says, "Most people wouldn't even die

878
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,820
 "for a righteous man, but God shows his love for us,

879
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,540
 "and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

880
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,180
 If you're here today and you're wondering,

881
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,860
 "I don't know if I'm really convinced

882
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,040
 "that I should really lay my life down

883
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,180
 "to follow after him, that he's really,"

884
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,060
 because these are promises that he has made to his people.

885
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,940
 So if we don't know Jesus, if we're not in his family,

886
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,480
 these are actually not promises he's made to us,

887
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,920
 but God longs to be able to say to you,

888
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,660
 "You don't have to be afraid 'cause I'm with you,

889
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,340
 "because you're mine, and you can be his now."

890
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,020
 You don't even have to wait,

891
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,860
 you don't have to say a special incantation,

892
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,460
 you don't have to go to a special place.

893
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,420
 I mean, you can believe on Jesus,

894
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,220
 that he is who he said he is, that he paid for our sins,

895
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,820
 that he got up from the grave,

896
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,020
 and that he delights to be able to pour grace on you

897
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,900
 for an eternity.

898
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,220
 And let me tell you, when we're in the family of God,

899
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,740
 he just makes beautiful promises like this

900
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,280
 to us over and over again,

901
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,320
 and amazingly, he always keeps them.

902
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,980
 And then sometimes he keeps them,

903
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,020
 and we don't even notice, and then like a year later,

904
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,100
 he's like, "Man, God is good."

905
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,820
 I didn't even think about the way that God cared for me

906
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,660
 through these people.

907
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,620
 I didn't even think about the way that this hard thing

908
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,660
 is something God was using to strengthen me,

909
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,440
 just like he promised he would do.

910
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,100
 And when we are able to be reminded of the kind of God

911
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,480
 we have, the kind of promises that he keeps,

912
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,260
 then there's rest.

913
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,460
 Rest to know that these scary situations

914
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,720
 don't have to rule our lives.

915
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,720
 Rest to know that threats that seem big

916
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
 are not bigger than our God.

917
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,680
 Rest to know that God hasn't promised

918
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
 that those things that scare us won't hurt us.

919
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,800
 That's not one of his promises.

920
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,880
 But he said, "Even when they hurt you, I'm still with you,

921
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,680
 "and I'mma work 'em for your good."

922
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,420
 So that even in the toughest situations that hurt a lot,

923
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,640
 I know God is with me.

924
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,400
 That freedom is available to all of us.

925
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,600
 For some of us, it means we need to join God's family,

926
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,080
 and grab ahold of those promises.

927
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,400
 And for some of us, it means I need to push further in

928
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,080
 to know God more so that I can walk in that freedom

929
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,760
 he's provided for me in Jesus.

930
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,740
 And so, friends, that's what my desire is for you tonight.

931
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,580
 And I'm praying that this word,

932
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,360
 that knowing God means we don't have to know fear,

933
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,140
 would be a reality for you.

934
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,980
 Let me pray.

935
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,440
 Father, we're so grateful for how gracious you are to us.

936
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,760
 Father, that you bring so much strength

937
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,720
 where we have so much weakness, God.

938
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,820
 That we bring death, but you bring life, Father.

939
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,460
 That we bring sin, and you bring righteousness, Lord.

940
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,080
 Father, that we bring bitterness and hatred,

941
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,180
 and you bring love and forgiveness, Father.

942
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,320
 You've shown time and time again that you're willing

943
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,040
 to be a strong God to weak people.

944
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,600
 And we thank you for that, God.

945
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,040
 God, I pray for my brothers and sisters

946
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,760
 who are in this room who know you, God,

947
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,780
 that you'd help us to know you more,

948
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,320
 see you more clearly, Father,

949
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,160
 to walk in the freedom that you've given us.

950
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,320
 And God, we pray for our friends in here

951
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,880
 who don't know you yet or are not sure

952
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,920
 that they know you yet.

953
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,860
 God, we pray you would show them how good you are.

954
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,440
 God, that you'd remind them that this is not,

955
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,120
 it's not something that's too good to be true.

956
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,160
 This is true.

957
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,960
 You are who you say you are, Father.

958
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,800
 And that you've been so gracious

959
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,160
 that you haven't asked us to clean ourselves up

960
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,840
 and to come to you strong already.

961
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,040
 You said, "Just come to me weak like you are.

962
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,200
 I'll provide the strength.

963
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,400
 I'll provide the forgiveness.

964
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,760
 I'll provide the good works.

965
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,960
 I'll give it all to you.

966
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,200
 Just acknowledge, come, and trust."

967
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,880
 And so, Father, we pray you'd work that in their hearts, God.

968
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,880
 And God, we pray you'd help all of us to know you

969
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,560
 and to trust you.

970
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,800
 And we ask in Jesus' name, amen.

971
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:19,800
