 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:32,860
 All right, friends in the room.

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,860
 Welcome back to night two of The Porch.

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,340
 It feels so good to be back with you all

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,300
 and to be up here and just talking together.

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,760
 If we haven't met, my name is JD.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,940
 I'm the creative director here at The Porch

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,140
 and get to hang out with you guys every Tuesday night.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,260
 And as always, to our friends tuning in online

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,380
 and all over different places across the country.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,800
 And if you're streaming in Dallas,

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,740
 we just want to say welcome and we're so glad that you are here.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,020
 But I am on a time frame, so let's get right to it.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,460
 Everyone knows that last week we started a new series called

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,660
 Matchmaker, where we're talking about all things singleness,

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,420
 dating, marriage, engagement, love life.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,660
 And everyone, they want to know about how do you

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,500
 have a successful love life.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,920
 And we're hoping that this series,

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,180
 as we're kind of playing on the idea of a dating app,

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,940
 since those are really popular right now,

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,380
 we're kind of going, hey, what would your maker

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,860
 have to say about your future match

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,300
 and how you should pursue them and love them

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,500
 and how you should take care of yourself

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,420
 before you even go searching for a match?

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,100
 What would your maker have of you?

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,460
 And so that's what we're exploring.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,020
 Last week, we talked about, hey,

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,740
 you've got to build the right profile.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,340
 You've got to build your right life now

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,740
 as a single individual.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,420
 Don't try to drag somebody into all your mess.

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,420
 Focus time now to become God's man, God's woman,

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,940
 and build the right profile.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,940
 And tonight I get to talk to you guys

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,300
 about your search history,

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,660
 'cause who doesn't love to talk

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,100
 about their past relationships?

41
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,180
 All right, yeah, some of you are like, oh God,

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,700
 trust me, you don't want to go there, buddy.

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,800
 And I do, I really do.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,700
 I want all the tea.

45
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,100
 And so tonight we're going to talk about

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
 how we have to, we have to address our history

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,600
 if we're going to have a flourishing future in dating.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,260
 Because a lot of us, most people in this room,

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,820
 statistics would say, are going to end up married

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,900
 one day before the age of 50.

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,100
 I think it's like 90%, David said last week,

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,300
 which is crazy.

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,940
 And if you want a future success in dating,

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,340
 in marriage, in your love life, in all of those things,

55
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,940
 you've got to address your past.

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,980
 It just has to happen.

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,300
 You got to go, hey, what things from my past

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,740
 in my history, if I looked at my search history,

59
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,580
 what's influencing my future and my present reality?

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,160
 And as I'm just thinking about this,

61
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,300
 a lot of people aren't just searching.

62
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,720
 Like we're on the hunt.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,220
 Like we are clawing at the bit to find our match.

64
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,660
 And as I was thinking about hunting,

65
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,660
 I actually grew up in deep East Texas, near Longview, Texas.

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,380
 And yeah, 903 baby.

67
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,500
 And I, in East Texas, it's just kind of a thing

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,140
 that you grow up and you go hunting a lot.

69
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,680
 It's just like, you always go hunting.

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,360
 It was very few times when there was something

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,700
 not on the dinner table that we did not hunt ourselves.

72
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,860
 Talk about Whole Foods.

73
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,700
 And it was through growing up hunting that I learned that,

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,300
 hey, before you even go to the deer stand,

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,520
 before you even go out to hunt,

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,740
 there's some things that you just got to do.

77
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,420
 And one of those things is target practice.

78
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,940
 But before we even target practice,

79
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,400
 you have to do something called sighting your gun.

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,180
 All right, people from Dallas, Miami, whatever, California,

81
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,420
 you got to sight your gun, which basically just means,

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,280
 hey, you've got to get the scope.

83
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,940
 So, you know, like there's a picture of a rifle.

84
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,700
 There's a scope on it that you look through

85
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,860
 and there's these cross arrows

86
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,540
 and you've got to line them up with your target

87
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,940
 and then bam, you shoot.

88
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,780
 Okay.

89
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,820
 But before you do that, you're never going to hit your target

90
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,780
 if your sighting is off.

91
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,740
 And so there's some things, you've got to turn these knobs.

92
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,340
 It's all about elevation and windage

93
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,980
 and all these phrases that I won't flex with you right now.

94
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,540
 And you do all this to make sure that, hey,

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,200
 when I put these cross arrows on the bullseye,

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,020
 it's going to hit it every time.

97
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,940
 'Cause that's the job of the gun.

98
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,740
 And so one time when I was like 13, my dad took me out.

99
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,900
 We had this pond, you shot across the pond at the targets.

100
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
 And I was a pretty good shot, not going to lie.

101
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,220
 And I pull up the gun and I line up the cross arrows

102
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,580
 right on the bullseye and I start shooting

103
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,660
 and it's just missing it.

104
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,860
 I mean, it's not even hitting the target.

105
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,500
 And my dad's like, son, what are you doing?

106
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,020
 Like, come on, like put it together.

107
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,660
 And I'm like, dad, I don't miss.

108
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,100
 Something is wrong with the gun.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,980
 I don't miss.

110
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,460
 And he was like, well, you're missing.

111
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,380
 Like I already sighted the gun.

112
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,620
 I already did everything right.

113
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,660
 You're just missing the target.

114
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,860
 And so I just kept going and kept going.

115
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,700
 He's like, give me a try.

116
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,100
 And you know, he's convinced that I might miss,

117
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,180
 but dad's never miss.

118
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,100
 And so he pulls out the gun and he goes to shoot

119
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,580
 and he doesn't even hit the target.

120
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,940
 And now suddenly he's like, okay, okay,

121
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,340
 something must be wrong with the gun.

122
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,900
 And he takes a look and he says, oh, I sighted the wrong gun.

123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,540
 This is, I haven't sighted this yet.

124
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,120
 So he does the things necessary.

125
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,960
 What do you know?

126
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,740
 He picks it up, put it on the bullseye and I hit it.

127
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,420
 And I start there because I think a lot of us,

128
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,380
 we have done everything right.

129
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,020
 We might even have the right idea of what the target is

130
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,540
 for a future happy dating life or a marriage.

131
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,440
 We might go, hey, I know that I'm supposed to date

132
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,980
 someone godly who goes to church.

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,740
 Like I know the target and I know how to operate the gun,

134
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,740
 but your sights are all off and they're all out of whack.

135
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,840
 And some of you are like, man, I just don't get it.

136
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,760
 I feel like I'm lining up the cross arrows

137
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
 and I'm putting it on the bullseye,

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,640
 but why do I keep missing?

139
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
 Why do I keep ending up with the jerks?

140
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,760
 Why do I keep ending up with another crazy girl?

141
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,240
 Huh, what could it be?

142
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,000
 And you keep missing the target and missing the target,

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
 even though you feel like you're doing everything right,

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,240
 it's 'cause you haven't put in the work

145
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,760
 and you're searching to put your sights on the right thing.

146
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,000
 And you're actually missing the target

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,040
 'cause you don't even know what the target is.

148
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,980
 And so tonight I wanna make sure that you and I

149
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,880
 were on the same page of, hey, what would God say

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,600
 through his word is the target

151
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,840
 for a successful dating relationship?

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,600
 What would he say is the target for a future spouse,

153
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,960
 the person you're looking for,

154
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,880
 and how do you hit the bullseye?

155
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,080
 And I wanna show you how you can take shots

156
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,720
 about the right person and you won't keep missing the target.

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
 That's what I wanna do tonight.

158
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,320
 And I'm gonna do that by asking a few questions.

159
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,080
 Before you even go to search for a person,

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,700
 you have to ask, what have you been searching for?

161
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,960
 Why have you been searching for it?

162
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,140
 And then I wanna talk about

163
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,980
 what you're actually searching for.

164
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,100
 So really quickly, one more time,

165
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,740
 what have you been searching for?

166
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,020
 Why have you been searching for it?

167
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,140
 And what you're actually searching for?

168
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,940
 So in order to hit the target, I don't wanna assume like,

169
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,000
 hey, I did say like, I had some assumptions in there.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,860
 Like we all like know the idea of God's design for marriage.

171
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,580
 So we get the target, but we keep missing.

172
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,240
 And I don't wanna assume that actually everyone knows

173
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
 what God wants for love.

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
 What God wants for you when you fall in love

175
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
 and the person that you're looking to love you

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,360
 and the person that you're looking to love

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,280
 and how to even operate in this thing that we call love.

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,320
 And so I'm gonna take us to a passage of scripture

179
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,440
 that you probably all have heard

180
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
 if you've attended a wedding.

181
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,520
 It's 1 Corinthians 13, because there it's famous

182
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,760
 for a reason, it's just clearly painted in God's word,

183
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
 what love looks like.

184
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,880
 And it sets up the perfect target for you and I

185
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,980
 to make sure we don't miss when searching for it.

186
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,880
 So if you would, 1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse four,

187
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,220
 it says, "Love is patient and kind.

188
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,720
 "Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude.

189
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,400
 "It does not demand its own way.

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,540
 "It is not irritable.

191
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,900
 "It keeps no record of being wronged.

192
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,960
 "It is not rejoice about injustice,

193
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,900
 "but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.

194
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,200
 "Love never gives up.

195
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 "It never loses faith.

196
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,780
 "Love is always hopeful

197
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,420
 "and endures through every circumstance."

198
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,060
 And so if you're missing the target,

199
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,380
 even though you can read that and be like,

200
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,460
 "Okay, I see all the things, so why do I keep missing it?"

201
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,280
 Before we talk about why you keep searching

202
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,500
 and hitting the wrong thing and not ending up

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,780
 with the jerk, ending up with the crazy person,

204
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,240
 let's talk about what?

205
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,780
 Let's address the past.

206
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
 Let's talk about it.

207
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,100
 What have you been searching for?

208
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,660
 And I bet right now, if I could go to each of you

209
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,260
 and go to your dating profile

210
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,480
 and your past dating relationships,

211
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,900
 if I could look at the search history that is your love life

212
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,600
 and could click on every single one of you,

213
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,680
 I would see some interesting people.

214
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,820
 I bet all of you would be like,

215
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,920
 "Yeah, there was this one girl in eighth grade, crazy."

216
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
 You don't wanna get in contact with her.

217
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
 Or some of you would be like,

218
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
 "Yeah, this guy, I mean, he was trouble.

219
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,340
 "I don't know what I was thinking.

220
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
 "How was I thinking?

221
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,000
 "Why did I think that?

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,840
 "Why did I let myself get there?

223
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
 "Blah, blah, blah."

224
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,800
 And you would wonder and be like,

225
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,520
 "Yeah, it's not pretty."

226
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
 And I bet for a lot of you,

227
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,260
 I would find out that for ladies,

228
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,040
 maybe you've looked for the businessman,

229
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,760
 the college athlete, the jock.

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,740
 You've looked for the successful guy.

231
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,260
 You look for the most outgoing guy at the party, at the bar.

232
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,400
 But also you don't just find those things in the guy.

233
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 You also end up with the guy that's a major narcissist.

234
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,880
 He's controlling, he's passive.

235
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,680
 He's just a straight up jerk.

236
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,600
 You never kind of knew where he like stood with you.

237
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,020
 You're like, "Are we like in this?"

238
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,960
 He's never really defined.

239
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,160
 We never really DTR, define the relationship.

240
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
 Like, where is this heading?

241
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
 He was never clear with you.

242
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
 There was never clarity.

243
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,000
 You would not, he would ghost you for like four days

244
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
 and then randomly be like, "You up?"

245
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
 It's like that kind of guy.

246
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
 Okay?

247
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,320
 And what you have to ask yourself is,

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,800
 "What was I searching for in him?

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,980
 "Like, what did I see?

250
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,800
 "Like, was I just, was I that thirsty?"

251
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,700
 And like, some of you are like, "Yep, guilty, I was."

252
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,800
 But you have to know that it didn't bring you love.

253
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,080
 It only brought you hurt.

254
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,600
 And for guys, maybe for you, it's like,

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
 "Hey, yeah, you're searching for the cheer,

256
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
 "the girl that was a cheerleader in college.

257
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,680
 "Maybe she's a professional dancer now.

258
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,440
 "You're searching for the wildest sorority girl."

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,600
 That's what her reputation was.

260
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
 The girl that's kind of known as like,

261
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,420
 "Hey, she'll like post bikini pictures

262
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,000
 "all over her Instagram and be way too revealing

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,280
 "like a Kardashian, but she like loves God too."

264
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,000
 And like, you are looking for these women

265
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,980
 and you're like, "Yeah, bro,

266
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,240
 "like, did you see her Instagram bio?

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,400
 "She clearly reads scripture.

268
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,560
 "It says Philippians 4.13."

269
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,780
 And you convince yourself,

270
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,380
 "Hey, like, I found my woman, this woman of God,

271
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,320
 "this wog," some would say.

272
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,520
 And then with that,

273
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,420
 because that's what you're searching for,

274
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,760
 you're gonna find what you're searching for.

275
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
 She's crazy.

276
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,240
 She's emotionally codependent.

277
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,560
 She's like hitting you up 24/7,

278
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
 like stage five clinger, okay?

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
 If you try to leave, she's like, "You're never leaving.

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,160
 "Like, I'll find you."

281
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,680
 Like, that's how the kind of girl she is.

282
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
 She's the kind of girl that like introduces you

283
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,680
 to mom and dad like way too fast

284
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,360
 and is like, "Hi, I'm like my future husband."

285
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,680
 Like, she's that kind of girl.

286
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,780
 And you're like, "Oh my gosh,

287
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,260
 "I am feeling like she is way too obsessed with me.

288
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,360
 "I gotta get out."

289
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,740
 And then she's the kind of girl that once you're like,

290
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,480
 "Hey, I'm ending things."

291
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
 She's like, "Well, fine, leave.

292
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
 "You're a jerk anyways.

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
 "I don't need no man."

294
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,320
 And then you move on and you actually find another person.

295
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
 And then she's in that person's DMs.

296
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,020
 And she's like, "He's a jerk.

297
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,860
 "Don't go for him.

298
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,200
 "Trust me, girl, I've been there, done that."

299
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,020
 And it's like, that is what is so common.

300
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,560
 Like we are searching for all the wrong things.

301
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,380
 And some of you are like, "Hey, hey, hey, easy.

302
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,680
 "Like, I'm that person.

303
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,420
 "Like, I'm the person in the relationship

304
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,640
 "that you're describing."

305
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,600
 Some of those things kind of hit a nerve.

306
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,980
 And that's what I wanna talk about tonight.

307
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,420
 I think a lot of times the things that we're searching for

308
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,500
 say a lot about us.

309
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,060
 And we make it about them.

310
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,960
 They're crazy.

311
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,380
 They're the issue.

312
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,260
 They drink too much.

313
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,760
 He's really abusive, verbally.

314
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,460
 Maybe for some of you, physically.

315
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,760
 Hey, she is like so obsessed with me.

316
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
 It's too much.

317
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
 I gotta get out of here, bro.

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,740
 And I think a lot of times what you and I search for

319
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,400
 has nothing to do with the person we ended up with.

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,960
 It actually has everything to do with you.

321
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,680
 Why are you searching for it?

322
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,380
 Because something we say a lot around here is

323
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,400
 the common denominator of all these individuals

324
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,860
 that you can put names to, it's not them.

325
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,360
 They have, yeah, sure, they all have their issues.

326
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,180
 But let's not forget the common denominator is you.

327
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,540
 You're the person in every one of those relationships

328
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,680
 that's gone from the next, to the next,

329
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,320
 to the next, to the next.

330
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
 So what does it have to say?

331
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,680
 What does your search history have to say about you

332
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,740
 and the things that you're searching for

333
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,840
 in your own condition and heart?

334
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
 It's like this.

335
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,240
 One time in college, I discovered Google Predict,

336
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
 like Google autofill.

337
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,020
 If you haven't done this, it's super fun.

338
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,560
 You like type in like half a sentence

339
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
 and then you see like Google pulls the algorithm

340
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
 where all of the history has searched for,

341
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
 like this is commonly searched things.

342
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,320
 And so let me predict what I think you're gonna search for

343
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,040
 based off of everyone typing these things.

344
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,780
 And so one time I typed, why do I?

345
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,200
 And there's like, why do I sweat so much?

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
 Why do I feel dizzy?

347
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,560
 Why do I have diarrhea?

348
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,740
 Why do I have a headache?

349
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,080
 Why do I bruise so easily?

350
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,480
 I bet that's a girl because girls bruise all the time.

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,620
 Like it's just like, they're like a banana.

352
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,440
 Why do I feel so tired?

353
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,820
 Why do I feel nauseous?

354
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,320
 Why do I sleep so much?

355
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,880
 Why do I pee so much?

356
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,000
 Why do I feel like throwing up?

357
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,480
 And I'm sitting there and I'm like, hmm.

358
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,680
 Like I don't personally like relate with any of these things

359
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,320
 but I am kind of curious what Google would have to say.

360
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,760
 And I'm not gonna tell you which one I clicked on,

361
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,740
 but I like did click on one of them

362
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,480
 because I'm a guy and I'm in college

363
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,800
 and I'm just wondering, you know,

364
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,640
 asking for a friend for future.

365
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,560
 Like is Tom's actually good remedies

366
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,440
 or just a quick bandaid?

367
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,480
 Anyways, so I do this search and later that day,

368
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,880
 this guy I really looked up to was like,

369
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,800
 hey bro, can I borrow your computer?

370
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,560
 And I'm like, yeah, totally.

371
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,520
 And I give him my computer and he goes

372
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,060
 and it's like slow motion.

373
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,160
 He goes to click on the Google search engine

374
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,000
 and I'm like, oh my gosh, I engaged with the algorithm.

375
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,940
 And so I clicked on it.

376
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,900
 Therefore, it's now a member of my search history,

377
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,360
 meaning that when he clicks the search,

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,760
 it's gonna pop up in purple letters

379
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,320
 revealing that I searched that thing.

380
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
 And so I'm like, no, I'm running to him.

381
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,640
 And then he clicks the thing with the cursor,

382
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,360
 it pops down and sure enough, right at the top of the list,

383
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,080
 my most recent search is why do I have diarrhea?

384
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,100
 And he's like, you good?

385
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,120
 He's like, you all right?

386
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,560
 Like you okay?

387
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,600
 Like, 'cause this, and I'm like, no, I was just,

388
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,480
 and he was like, uh-huh.

389
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 And I was like, I promise.

390
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,400
 And he was like, uh-huh.

391
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,480
 And I was like, oh, okay, whatever.

392
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,920
 And for the rest of my college career,

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,280
 every time I saw that guy, he's like,

394
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,320
 bro, you need some Pepto?

395
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
 I got you.

396
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
 And I'm like, oh.

397
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,100
 And I would have given anything to have been able

398
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,400
 to delete my search history because it impacted

399
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,720
 that present relationship.

400
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,200
 And what actually happened was,

401
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,960
 is he was no longer concerned about what I was searching.

402
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,480
 He was concerned about why are you searching for it?

403
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,720
 He's like, are you sick?

404
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,800
 Do you need help?

405
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,960
 And why didn't you just tell me?

406
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
 Which is such a logical next question,

407
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,760
 which leads to my second question.

408
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,200
 Why are you searching for it?

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,540
 Why are you searching for love

410
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,660
 in all of these places that are never gonna satisfy?

411
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,820
 Why, when I look at your search history,

412
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
 do I see you going back to another jerk?

413
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,700
 And here's the thing, girls,

414
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,900
 you convince yourself as a coping mechanism,

415
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,620
 you're like, well, the jerk is kind of like the bad guy,

416
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,180
 and it's kind of a thrill.

417
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
 That's what you tell yourself.

418
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,940
 You're like, I want kind of the bad guy.

419
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,220
 He can't be too good.

420
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,100
 He can't be too nice.

421
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,620
 He has to perfectly balance the line between like,

422
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,520
 hey, do you know if I want you?

423
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,300
 I'm mysterious, yet I'm also like, I'm about you.

424
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
 And you have to tell this line.

425
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,120
 It makes it really difficult for us guys, by the way,

426
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,040
 trying to do it right.

427
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,640
 But anyways, you are sitting there and you're like,

428
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 I keep returning back to people who only hurt me.

429
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,040
 Like a dog, like the Bible would say,

430
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
 like returning to its vomit.

431
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,640
 You're just going back and going back.

432
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,500
 For guys, why are you pursuing women

433
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 who are riddled with insecurities and self-image issues

434
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:33,420
 and distracting them and convincing them

435
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,420
 that you're their solution to their problem?

436
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,840
 But the reality is, you know good and well,

437
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,760
 that a lot of times the reason why you actually go out

438
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,440
 to those women is not to be some source of comfort,

439
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,020
 not to be some source of like a place for them to run to.

440
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,800
 Maybe sure that's in there,

441
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 but also these women are really easy for you to not,

442
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,860
 to abuse and to use for your own selfish game.

443
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,220
 So why are you searching for it?

444
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,820
 You can't just make the problem all about your search history

445
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,960
 and those people, and it was their issue.

446
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
 It was their issue.

447
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 It was their issue.

448
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,300
 It was their self-esteem issues.

449
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,580
 It was his passive father, blah, blah, blah.

450
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,680
 You have to, at some point, go,

451
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,100
 but what's wrong with me for thinking

452
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
 that that is what I needed?

453
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,720
 I just want to talk about a couple of these really quick.

454
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,700
 Because if you want any chance,

455
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,100
 listen, if you want any chance of actually finding

456
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,620
 like this version of Mr. Right or Mrs. Right,

457
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,940
 then you have to spend time asking yourself,

458
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,220
 why do I keep going back to Mr. Wrong

459
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,240
 and Mrs. Wrong?

460
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,740
 And so, although painful, let's just talk about it.

461
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,220
 I just want to use a couple of examples.

462
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,980
 And I know that every single person here right now

463
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,820
 has your own individual story

464
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,540
 that impacts your view of love.

465
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,200
 And it impacts like your worldview

466
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
 of what you think love is.

467
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,940
 A lot of you come in here with different parents

468
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,220
 that have demonstrated love, maybe in a great way.

469
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,320
 Other people that you meet,

470
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,140
 their parents did not show them love in a good way.

471
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,460
 They were not committed to each other.

472
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,440
 There was divorce.

473
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,860
 There were so many different things.

474
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,500
 A lot of you maybe like came in here and you're saying,

475
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,900
 hey, I have been abused or I have been cheated on.

476
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,860
 I have been hurt.

477
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,940
 I have been heartbroken.

478
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,140
 He said he wouldn't leave and then he cheats on me.

479
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,220
 And I have thought about that

480
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,540
 and I have let that impact every relationship ever since.

481
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,500
 And all of these things are influencing

482
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,460
 all these different stories

483
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,780
 that make up your search history.

484
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,300
 And I just want to say, I get it.

485
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,160
 I have my own things that I searched for in my life

486
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,620
 that I thought would bring me satisfaction

487
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,300
 and bring me true love.

488
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,660
 And I'm still waking up to the reality

489
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,020
 that love is not in those things.

490
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
 But I had to address it.

491
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,380
 And so for anyone, first ask yourself,

492
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,340
 are my past experiences influencing my search?

493
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,020
 Are my past experiences influencing my search?

494
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,260
 Have you messed up so bad that you've convinced yourself

495
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,420
 or have you done something so bad

496
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,080
 that you convinced yourself like self-torture,

497
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,260
 like self-deprecation?

498
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,100
 You've just told yourself,

499
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,060
 hey, I don't deserve actual happiness.

500
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,220
 I don't deserve actual love.

501
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,820
 I know you're telling me what the target is,

502
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,580
 that love is patient, love is kind, love is never ending.

503
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,060
 Love is all these amazing things,

504
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,860
 but I have not done amazing things.

505
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,020
 I've done really messed up things.

506
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,640
 Therefore, I get what I deserve.

507
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
 I had it coming to me.

508
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,060
 Therefore, you keep running to something.

509
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,340
 You keep running to a version of a man or a woman

510
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,380
 that is only hurting you.

511
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,900
 And you're digging yourself deeper and deeper and deeper.

512
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,100
 And I'm telling you that that doesn't have to be your story.

513
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,300
 It doesn't have to be your narrative.

514
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,940
 There is more out there for you,

515
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,100
 but you're never gonna find it in a person.

516
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,540
 And so what past experiences?

517
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,300
 Maybe you've only seen bad.

518
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,200
 I wanna say if that's true, I'm sorry,

519
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,460
 but I'm here to tell you tonight and remind you tonight,

520
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,020
 and maybe inform you for the first time tonight

521
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,880
 that God's word says that love is possible

522
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,700
 in him and through him.

523
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,180
 And we'll get to that in a second.

524
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,320
 Maybe some of you, I think a lot of this,

525
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,020
 we talk about this a lot here, but for men,

526
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,640
 and I know that even the rate is growing more and more

527
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,380
 for women, which just breaks my heart, but pornography.

528
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,820
 I think pornography, it influences our search.

529
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,560
 I wanna talk about another hunting story, weirdly enough.

530
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,020
 I loved in high school, we would go,

531
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,500
 we would sit around a fire and we had these hunting dogs.

532
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,260
 And what you do is if you're hunting for like pigs,

533
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,300
 like hogs or coyotes, whatever it is,

534
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,540
 you go and you get something that has the sense

535
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,300
 of the thing that you want them to track down.

536
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,380
 You're like, yep, we've seen a, I don't know,

537
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,460
 fox in the hat or something.

538
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,940
 And so you go and you get it and you bring the dogs over,

539
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,100
 they sniff it, they sniff it.

540
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
 And this part's really important.

541
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,360
 You can't mess this up.

542
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,220
 You can't mess it up.

543
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,180
 What they sniff, they will go find.

544
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,120
 They're gonna go find it.

545
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,260
 Whatever it is, they will not stop until you tell them to.

546
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,220
 They will search all night until they find what they sniff.

547
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,820
 It triggers something in their mind that tells them,

548
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,140
 hey, I am tracking this thing down

549
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,700
 and I will not stop until it's mine.

550
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,420
 And I think a lot of times our past experiences,

551
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,180
 pornography, culture, society is the thing

552
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,180
 that you are putting against your nose, against your life.

553
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,100
 And you are sniffing and you are telling your brain

554
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,920
 and your heart, go find it.

555
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:31,340
 And guys, girls, if you are addicted to pornography,

556
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,740
 if pornography has influenced and triggered your brain

557
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,120
 and your heart to go, this is passion,

558
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,660
 this is love, someone to meet all of these fantasies,

559
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,900
 it is gonna influence your search

560
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,140
 and what you're looking after.

561
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,100
 And no longer are you looking for a woman

562
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,820
 who clothes herself in the Lord

563
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,220
 or a guy who is God's man.

564
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,580
 You are running after someone

565
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,820
 who thinks they have to sexualize themselves

566
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,660
 and make themselves some sexual being to entertain you

567
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,380
 and to actually receive affection from you.

568
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,780
 And that isn't love.

569
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,380
 And you're not only hurting yourself,

570
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,220
 you're hurting them.

571
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,600
 It's like this one time I was talking to David

572
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
 and just getting dating advice.

573
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,340
 I was practically a hotline caller.

574
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,180
 And I'm like, bro, there's this girl.

575
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,060
 And I'm really confused because she's all about God.

576
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,220
 She has this podcast.

577
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,560
 She does these amazing things for God,

578
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 but she also posts these images that just distract me.

579
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,340
 Like, yeah, God's given her an amazing body

580
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,040
 and she's worked hard for that body.

581
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,520
 But she's posting these pictures in swimsuits

582
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,500
 and workout gear.

583
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,820
 And she's walking around in public

584
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,080
 and it's causing me to take my eyes off of God

585
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,380
 and put it on her.

586
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,980
 And I'm like, I don't wanna do that.

587
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,100
 So like, but she loves God.

588
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,140
 And what is that?

589
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,340
 What do I do with that?

590
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,460
 And David in his wisdom was like, hey, first off,

591
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,180
 you have to address in your heart

592
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,380
 what's triggering you to see her

593
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
 as anything other than God's daughter.

594
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,620
 Like what in you is immediately objectifying her

595
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,340
 and allowing you to see her in that light

596
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,780
 because that's not God's best for you or for her.

597
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,560
 And I wanna take a second to get off a men's back

598
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,380
 and talk to you ladies.

599
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,900
 As someone who is looking and trying hard

600
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,100
 to pursue the Lord and to find a woman doing the same,

601
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,460
 it gets really confusing when she says she's about God,

602
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,860
 but she seems more, I wanna say this nicely,

603
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,860
 she seems more interested in me checking out her chest

604
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,680
 and her heart.

605
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:44,860
 It gets really confusing because I'm not blaming you.

606
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,700
 I'm taking ownership of saying, man,

607
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,340
 I have given in to culture.

608
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,100
 I've given into society and I've let society

609
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,940
 in its plaguing sense,

610
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,700
 convince me of all these messed up fantasies.

611
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,500
 And therefore I can't help myself.

612
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,980
 And I'm trying to devote myself to the Lord

613
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,400
 and keep my eyes on him.

614
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,020
 But I hope that you would do the same.

615
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,680
 And I think that if you would do the same,

616
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,840
 you would know about yourself.

617
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,460
 Hey, modesty, this is a beautiful way

618
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,300
 I heard this put one time,

619
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,300
 modesty, it's not hiding your body behind clothing.

620
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
 Modesty is not about hiding your body.

621
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,620
 It's about revealing your dignity.

622
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,020
 It's about revealing that you know your worth.

623
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,340
 You know your value.

624
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
 You know that you are God's daughter

625
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,200
 and that you have a father who loves you.

626
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,300
 Therefore you don't have anything to prove with your body.

627
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,660
 You don't have anything to prove with flaunting yourself

628
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,800
 and showing yourself off to some guy to get his attention

629
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,140
 'cause he's only gonna use you.

630
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,180
 And I wanna tell you,

631
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,260
 if a guy is searching after that kind of girl,

632
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,500
 why is he finding you?

633
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,340
 If he's finding you, that's an issue.

634
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,540
 And so don't give in to him.

635
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,060
 And guys, if you're searching for that kind of girl,

636
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,340
 if pornography and culture has been the thing

637
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,780
 that you have sniffed and gone after to track after

638
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,020
 and find that kind of girl,

639
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,580
 you need to check your heart

640
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,860
 and you need to rearrange some things

641
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,860
 and you do not need to bring a woman into your mess.

642
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,260
 You need to get it right in your singleness.

643
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,600
 So many hearts have been broken

644
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,620
 because men and women are objectifying one another

645
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,420
 and not treating each other

646
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,700
 like the image bearer of God that they are.

647
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,900
 The Bible says in Genesis

648
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,380
 that you are created in the image of God.

649
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,240
 Therefore treat yourself as such.

650
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
 It also says in the Corinthians

651
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,980
 that your body is a temple.

652
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,780
 The Holy Spirit, if you have a relationship with God,

653
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,820
 the Holy Spirit lives in you.

654
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,240
 Therefore glorify God with your body.

655
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,420
 And when you flaunt it

656
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,860
 and put it out there for the world to see,

657
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,680
 and men, when you chase after that,

658
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,860
 you're both communicating to you,

659
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,640
 hey, I'm more invested in using you than loving you.

660
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,220
 That's not God's best.

661
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,380
 Ladies, why?

662
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,780
 Why do you keep going back to the jerk

663
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,840
 of the guy who objectifies you, uses you?

664
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,220
 Think for a second with me.

665
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,500
 I'm here saying and confessing on behalf of men

666
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,180
 all over our world, I am sorry if you believe

667
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,620
 that you're only worth what you can give a man

668
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,080
 or what he says about you and your body.

669
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,780
 But if you are going after

670
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,100
 whoever will give you attention

671
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,820
 because of your low self-esteem issues,

672
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,420
 and maybe they were caused by past abuse,

673
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,780
 which again, I'm sorry for,

674
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,120
 maybe they're caused by you've never seen a good example

675
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,540
 in your marriage, in your parents' marriage,

676
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,640
 through divorce, through different things.

677
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,780
 Maybe your parents didn't give you the affection

678
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,020
 that you needed, the encouragement you needed.

679
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,720
 And so maybe you just have really low self-esteem issues.

680
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,660
 And so you're like, hey, I'll take what I can get.

681
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,380
 Anyone that will fill this void, you have to address that.

682
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,460
 And you have to turn to God's word and say, no, no, no, no.

683
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,060
 God says that he's chosen me, that he's adopted me.

684
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,600
 And then God has given me the target for what love really is.

685
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,440
 That love is patient and kind.

686
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
 It's not jealous.

687
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,340
 It's not rude.

688
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,240
 It doesn't demand its own way.

689
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,500
 And you deserve love.

690
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,860
 Men, you deserve a woman who sees herself

691
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,860
 through the love of her father.

692
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,100
 And there's so many more examples, like I said,

693
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,260
 that I could pull from and go, man,

694
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,600
 why are you searching for him?

695
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,980
 Why are you searching for her?

696
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,180
 Why are you searching for that?

697
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,500
 And we could sit down, and if I could,

698
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,180
 I would sit down with every single one of you

699
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,240
 and just go back and back and back

700
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,820
 and search and search and search

701
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,420
 and replay all the things in your life

702
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,900
 that have influenced your search.

703
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,700
 I wish I could go to every single one

704
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,820
 of your search history and look at the ways

705
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,480
 it's affecting your present reality

706
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,940
 and your future search of your person, but I just can't.

707
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,580
 And so I'm asking you, I'm begging you to take time,

708
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,220
 sit down with the Lord and go, why?

709
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,500
 Either why am I the end result of that toxic person's search

710
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,460
 or why am I searching for someone toxic

711
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,180
 and for someone that's only gonna hurt me

712
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,080
 and not love me?

713
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,420
 So caught my soapbox there.

714
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,660
 And so right now you might be wondering,

715
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,140
 okay, so then what?

716
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,700
 Like, addressed it, now what?

717
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
 And I just wanna close, like I wanna finish the night,

718
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,460
 like last point, have a close and just talk about,

719
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,760
 hey, what then are you actually searching for?

720
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,780
 Because I think if you knew the way that God designed you

721
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,240
 and the way that he created in you,

722
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,260
 what he created in you to search for,

723
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,060
 it would really help you out because you would realize

724
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,100
 that the search can be over.

725
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,820
 And so what God created you to actually search for,

726
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,140
 the first thing is that you are searching for someone

727
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,160
 to actually love you, to actually love you.

728
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,140
 You're tired of the jerks.

729
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,840
 You're fed up with the heartbreak.

730
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,540
 You're tired of the girl that's just like,

731
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,060
 man, what is going on here?

732
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,840
 And you want and you crave actual love.

733
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
 First John 4, eight says,

734
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,080
 "But anyone who does not love does not know God,

735
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,680
 "for God is love."

736
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,640
 Read that, anyone who does not love does not know God,

737
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
 for God is love.

738
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,060
 So how can we expect someone to properly love us

739
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,940
 if they're not walking with God?

740
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,560
 Like, think about that.

741
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,180
 If the Bible is true, and when it says that God is love,

742
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,000
 why are we searching for anyone

743
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,700
 that doesn't have a abiding relationship with God?

744
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,220
 And you have to ask yourself,

745
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,220
 hey, like, does my search indicate something about me?

746
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,820
 Like, does my search say anything

747
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,640
 about my knowing of God's love?

748
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
 Because if I understood and knew God's love,

749
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,200
 would it allow me to be able to see

750
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,740
 someone who actually knows God?

751
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,160
 Let me put it a little more clearly.

752
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,720
 If you don't know God's love,

753
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,740
 you will never be able to spot someone who knows God.

754
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,820
 And if you aren't able to search for someone who knows God,

755
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,040
 then you will never experience love because God is love.

756
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,720
 I hope you're seeing that connection,

757
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,800
 how it's so important in your single years, guys.

758
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,100
 Don't wait to bring it into a relationship.

759
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,900
 Don't wait to bring it into another person.

760
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,620
 The time is now.

761
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,020
 Before you go on your search,

762
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,840
 you have to search yourself and go,

763
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,800
 where do I not fully know God?

764
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,480
 Where do I not fully understand His plan for me

765
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,060
 and His desires for me?

766
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,200
 And what He says true love is found,

767
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,680
 because when you search, you're gonna see that,

768
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,860
 oh, actual love is not found in a person or a match

769
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,880
 or in my idea of marriage or in porn

770
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,820
 or in hookups or dating apps or whatever it is.

771
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,580
 Love is not actually in those things.

772
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,520
 Love is not something in the future.

773
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,580
 Love is actually a reality that I can experience right now.

774
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,080
 And it's all in the hands of my maker.

775
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,500
 It's all in the inventor of love himself, God.

776
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,600
 And so you get to take time now to build that relationship

777
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,840
 and go, I'm gonna search and search and search,

778
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,680
 because if you become more confident

779
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,920
 in God's design for love and His love for you,

780
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,440
 I promise you, if you put in that work now,

781
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,480
 it will impact your love life.

782
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,320
 It'll impact the way that you love and pursue

783
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,400
 and cherish a person one day.

784
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,340
 But for some of you,

785
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,300
 the most loving thing that you can do is tonight,

786
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,960
 ask yourself and maybe look at the person

787
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
 that if you're in a dating relationship

788
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,040
 or whatever it might be,

789
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,880
 and look at them and go,

790
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,000
 I actually think that I haven't been loving you.

791
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,280
 I think I've been using you to only love myself more.

792
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,800
 And the healthiest thing that you might need to do

793
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,980
 is break up tonight and go experience love

794
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,960
 and search for love in the right place.

795
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,600
 And when you know the author of love,

796
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,260
 when you know God Himself, when you know Him more,

797
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,260
 then, then you go see what He has for you

798
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,460
 with another person who is doing the same.

799
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,140
 The second thing that we all actually are searching for

800
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,140
 is something that will last, a love that will last.

801
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,000
 That's why we say the wedding vows that we do

802
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,360
 for better or for worse till death do us part.

803
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,840
 We are looking for something that will last.

804
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,960
 And maybe you right now need to address,

805
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,320
 hey, do I truly believe that something can last?

806
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,120
 Is there something in my history

807
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,180
 that is influencing my reality that I'm going,

808
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,680
 hey, I actually am fine with like non-committal.

809
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,360
 I'm fine with just the highs on the weekends

810
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,520
 and just hooking up with someone

811
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,560
 or like not really having to like DTR and define this thing.

812
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,420
 I'm fine with this.

813
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,640
 Like I don't need something to last.

814
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,880
 Trust me, I'm doing just okay.

815
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,760
 My family's great.

816
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,920
 I'm getting successful things in work.

817
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,760
 It's all great.

818
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,880
 I'm fine.

819
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,440
 And I'm telling you, I know, and you know

820
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,800
 that there's gotta be more.

821
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,840
 And you know, deep down that you were designed

822
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,280
 and you want someone to look at you and say

823
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,880
 for better or worse till death do us part.

824
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,440
 But the reality is, is that you don't have to wait

825
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
 for the altar in a wedding one day.

826
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,960
 You can come to the altar now

827
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,320
 and you can come to the father now

828
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,800
 and he's gonna look at you and he's gonna say,

829
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,440
 hey, for better or for worse, no matter what you've done,

830
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,320
 no matter what you do,

831
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,440
 I don't care if your parents one day broke their vows

832
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,540
 and weren't committed to each other and divorced.

833
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,800
 I don't care if one day someone broke their commitment

834
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,200
 to you and cheated on you and did something outlandish.

835
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
 I care that you know that I am not those people

836
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,920
 and I am here to stay.

837
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,520
 You want a commitment, you can have it now.

838
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,880
 And just like love is in the hands of the father,

839
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,840
 the creator of love, so is a love that lasts

840
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,280
 because God does not break his vows.

841
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,880
 And if you need to come here and hear anything tonight,

842
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,520
 it's to simply remind yourself that God keeps his promise.

843
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,080
 God is committed to me and it is not contingent

844
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,280
 on my commitment to him.

845
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,220
 My past, the things I've searched for,

846
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,840
 the ways that I haven't loved him well,

847
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,440
 the ways that I haven't pursued him well,

848
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,920
 that does not determine how much that he's committed to me

849
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,760
 and he loves me.

850
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,160
 No, he just simply wants you to come

851
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,480
 and acknowledge that he's not leaving.

852
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,720
 The Bible says that God, many times it says,

853
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,780
 he will never leave you nor forsake you.

854
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,560
 And so, as I wrap up, like some of you might be thinking,

855
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,560
 hey, dude, I like what you're saying and it feels good

856
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,600
 and it gives me some hope.

857
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,920
 But if you actually saw my search history,

858
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,080
 the things I looked up, the people I've dated

859
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,240
 and the things that we've done,

860
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,960
 where if you have actually seen the way

861
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,660
 that I have been committed to God,

862
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,240
 you would laugh in my face.

863
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,580
 And I wanna teach you just really quick about a word

864
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,600
 that I talk about my dad a lot up here.

865
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,800
 He made a huge impact on my life.

866
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
 And one of my favorite things he did

867
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,560
 is he taught me about this word, to tell us die.

868
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,340
 And to tell us die was actually the last words

869
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,660
 that Jesus said on the cross.

870
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,160
 Right before he died, he's sitting there hanging

871
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,160
 and he said, to tell us die, which means it is finished,

872
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,920
 paid in full.

873
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,160
 And we know, if you know about the sacrifice

874
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,160
 that Jesus paid for yours and mine sin,

875
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,200
 we know that what Jesus was communicating was,

876
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,040
 hey, every sin of man, past, present and future,

877
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,920
 right now is paid in full, to tell us die.

878
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,960
 And so what my dad would do is he,

879
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,560
 this is all messed up now, but when he died a few years ago,

880
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,600
 my mom gave this to me and my dad would carry this around

881
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,440
 in his wallet.

882
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,160
 And I remember sometimes it just says,

883
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,680
 to tell us die, paid in full.

884
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,260
 And he wrote at the top charges.

885
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,440
 And here's why he did that.

886
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,720
 In these times when Jesus was alive,

887
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,000
 people that had messed up really bad would go to jail

888
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,840
 or prison.

889
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,080
 And once they got out, they would stand before a judge

890
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,480
 and he would say, hey, here's all the things you did wrong

891
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,380
 that put you in jail.

892
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,500
 And they would stamp it, to tell us die.

893
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,520
 You now can go be free.

894
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,720
 And the people would walk around the town

895
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
 and people would be like, hey, I remember you.

896
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,360
 Didn't you steal from that market?

897
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
 Or didn't we catch you in adultery?

898
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
 You should be in prison.

899
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,800
 And he would pull it out and he would say no.

900
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,920
 And as soon as they saw that stamp,

901
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,040
 they would be like, okay, paid in full, to tell us die.

902
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,240
 You've done your time, welcome, walk freely.

903
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,600
 And I love this.

904
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,160
 My dad would just remind himself.

905
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,040
 He has on here written drunkenness, murder,

906
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,380
 adultery, brawling.

907
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,680
 My dad didn't know Jesus until he was 33.

908
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,120
 He cheated on my mom so many times.

909
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,600
 He got a girl pregnant in high school.

910
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,440
 He never had a dad that demonstrated love for him.

911
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,640
 Left him when he was 10 years old.

912
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,080
 He has drugs, slander, unforgiveness, fighting, theft,

913
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,720
 wrong TV shows, wrong music, dipping, smoking, drugs,

914
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
 all of it.

915
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,680
 He wrote it on here.

916
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,800
 And when the devil and when people would be like,

917
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,960
 wait, what?

918
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,080
 You're a pastor now?

919
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,200
 Or wait, you got back with your wife and your kids

920
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,120
 and they're all, you're just a blessed family now.

921
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,960
 And you're doing the church thing, like what?

922
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,520
 You used to get high with me.

923
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,880
 Or you used to get drunk with me.

924
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
 Or we used to get in fist fights.

925
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,640
 Or you knocked up a girl in high school.

926
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
 You're not worthy of those things.

927
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,360
 And he would say, yes, yes, I am.

928
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,680
 And if they reminded him of something

929
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,720
 that he hadn't written down, he'd be like, thank you.

930
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
 And he would write it down and he would say,

931
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,400
 another thing that is paid in full.

932
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,560
 And what I want you to see in this story

933
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
 is that you and I,

934
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,120
 if we were to put our search history on this list,

935
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,000
 like some of you tonight actually might need to take

936
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,640
 a page from your journal and just write out

937
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,600
 maybe names, abusers, the things, the alcohol,

938
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,280
 the drugs, the porn,

939
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,000
 the most messed up things that you think,

940
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,200
 oh my gosh, if anyone knew, they would say,

941
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,600
 hey, you deserve to be back in your hole, in your darkness.

942
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,200
 What are you thinking that you deserve

943
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,760
 to search for worthiness and love

944
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,240
 and affection from a Christian person?

945
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,320
 You know who you are.

946
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,200
 This isn't for you.

947
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,280
 Blessings aren't for you.

948
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,800
 A life like this isn't for you.

949
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,440
 You're just gonna have to settle.

950
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,680
 You need to write it out.

951
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,800
 And like my dad, you need to say, hey, to Telestai,

952
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,800
 I'm paid in full because a lot of you,

953
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,360
 I think you have cleared your search history.

954
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,160
 And what I mean by that is you have hit clear

955
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,840
 and it's out of sight, out of mind,

956
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,320
 but it keeps coming back.

957
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,360
 And you haven't fully believed that it has been deleted,

958
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,280
 that those things don't define you.

959
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,960
 Therefore, they define your future relationship

960
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,120
 and define the future you.

961
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,280
 But I'm telling you that when Jesus Christ

962
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
 stepped down from heaven,

963
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,960
 he didn't come down so that you could live some partial life.

964
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,560
 He didn't come down so you could sow,

965
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,720
 so you could accept some half version of love.

966
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,560
 No, he came down declaring to Telestai, it is finished.

967
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,920
 Every single person here tonight

968
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
 has an opportunity to accept that forgiveness,

969
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,440
 accept that grace, accept that love

970
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,520
 and write it on your letter.

971
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,320
 Write your history on your letter and say,

972
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,000
 I will no longer let my history impact my future.

973
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,600
 Because when Jesus died, so did my past.

974
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,520
 And when God looks at me, he doesn't see my history.

975
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,400
 He sees a son right now and the righteousness of his son,

976
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,520
 the blood of his son is what he sees.

977
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,240
 And he says, and I wanna use him and his future

978
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,960
 and his love life and his friends

979
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,600
 and his impact and his job.

980
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,880
 I wanna change the future of the world through him,

981
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,680
 but you just have to see it.

982
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,880
 Because if you don't believe

983
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,280
 that you're worthy of your history

984
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,320
 to be deleted, done, paid in full,

985
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,280
 you are gonna continue to hurt and hurt others

986
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,920
 in your search, in your future.

987
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,800
 And God is saying, you don't have to search.

988
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,280
 Love is available now, commitment,

989
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,600
 a love that lasts is available now.

990
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,040
 And it may not be in a match, guys, I don't know.

991
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,600
 I don't know what your dating life's gonna look like.

992
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,440
 I don't know.

993
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,400
 God doesn't promise that he'll put us with someone

994
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,480
 or we'll find the one.

995
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,680
 But what he does promise is that our maker

996
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,920
 is fully capable of fulfilling every deepest longing

997
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
 in our heart.

998
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
 And that is available for you tonight.

999
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,360
 So stop searching in all the wrong places

1000
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,480
 and start searching his word and him

1001
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,520
 and all the things that he has to say about you

1002
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,160
 as a son and his daughter that he loves

1003
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,280
 and will never leave.

1004
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,640
 Believe that tonight.

1005
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,480
 Let's pray.

1006
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,120
 Father, thank you.

1007
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,680
 Thank you that

1008
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,080
 through the work of your son,

1009
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,040
 that he went through such an intense

1010
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,680
 and magnified punishment for every single person's past,

1011
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,840
 present and future.

1012
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,360
 That when we are reminded of our history,

1013
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,720
 when we're reminded of the things that we used to search for

1014
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,400
 to find satisfaction, that we don't have to sit

1015
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,640
 in guilt and shame, but that we can go,

1016
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,880
 hey, Jesus paid for that.

1017
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,640
 And now the things that used to embarrass us and shame us,

1018
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,560
 now remind us of nothing other than the goodness of God

1019
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,200
 to the life of his son and the death on the cross.

1020
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,360
 And so may that reality that a God loves us,

1021
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,120
 sees us as worthy,

1022
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,320
 cherishes us,

1023
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,160
 impact the love

1024
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,200
 and the relationships that we seek from people

1025
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,040
 from this day forward.

1026
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,680
 I pray in Jesus name that divorce rates would drop

1027
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,320
 because of what takes place tonight.

1028
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,480
 I pray that in Jesus name,

1029
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,360
 heartbreak will begin to diminish

1030
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,480
 because of Jesus's work tonight.

1031
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,680
 I pray that tonight in Jesus name

1032
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,360
 and through the work on his cross thousands of years ago,

1033
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,880
 that tonight someone would say,

1034
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,920
 hey, my story was filled of hurt.

1035
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,840
 It was full of heartbreak,

1036
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,760
 but now I'm gonna begin searching in the fullness

1037
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,320
 and the healing that the work of the cross provides.

1038
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,320
 May that be so of every person in this room.

1039
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,920
 In Jesus name that I pray, amen.
