[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [music]
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Well, what's up, Porch? How we doing tonight?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Hey, it's so good to see you. Welcome.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I'm glad you made it.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   If this is your first time ever with us on a Tuesday,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday evening.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   We've got a QR code on the screen.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We would love to connect with you
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and just help this place feel like home very quickly.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I also just want to say hello to all of our Porch Live locations
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   that are watching with us tonight.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I'm looking at you, Porch Live Cincinnati,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Porch Live Des Moines,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and for the first time ever, Porch Live Fresno,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   thank you for joining us.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Hope all is well with you guys.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Tonight, we are continuing our series that we are calling "Glory,"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and we have been walking through the Gospel of John.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And the best way for me to start
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is by just sharing with you what happened on my sixth date
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   with my wife, Catherine.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So after five dates, we reached the sixth date,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and I realized that it was time for us to have
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   a clarifying conversation in our relationship
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   that some people know as the DTR,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   which stands for "defining the relationship."
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And the way that I planned to have this clarifying conversation
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   with Catherine was I planned to do it at a concert,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   specifically a U2 concert.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Some of you--that's good to hear,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   because if the next generation is like U who?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   U2, all right?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   People, go look them up. They'll change your life.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But we went to this concert,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and I didn't know when I was going to do it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I just knew it was going to happen at some point in the concert,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and I just kind of wanted to let U2 lead the way.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And so we were in the concert.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   We were enjoying the concert.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   In the middle of the concert, Catherine said that she needed to go to the bathroom.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I said that I would go with her--not to the same restroom, obviously.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But we kind of did our separate things,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and I finished first,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and I'm giving you way too much information.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   All of this has been unnecessary up until this point.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   This is where it actually gets important.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I am waiting on Catherine to come out,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and I'm standing in, like, the breezeway,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   the tunnel that takes you back to your seats,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and I'm listening to U2,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and U2 is playing this song that's called "Sunday Bloody Sunday."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I realized in that moment, this is it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   This is when I'm going to have a DTR with Catherine.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You might be wondering if "Sunday Bloody Sunday" is a romantic song.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It is not.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It is about people dying.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But I realized that in this moment,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   there's going to be a birth of a new relationship.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I don't know how to make that tie to "Sunday Bloody Sunday,"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   but I realized that we're going to have a conversation.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So Catherine came out of the bathroom,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and we were about to go to our seats.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   U2 is playing "Sunday Bloody Sunday,"
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and right there I just stopped her,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and I just said, "Hey!
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I need to tell you something!"
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I said, "I like you!"
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   She said, "I like you, too!"
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I was like, "I like you, too, but do you like me, too?"
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And she said, "This is what happened."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I said, "I like you!"
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And she said, "I like you, too!"
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I just froze, and I was like, "All right."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We just went back to our seats,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and we stood silently next to each other for about 20 minutes.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And that really--it was--
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the reason I shared that night with you
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   is the real DTR in our relationship
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   happened while watching the animated movie "Chicken Little,"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   but a U2 concert sounds way sexier,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   so we'll just say that that was the moment.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But my point in telling you all this
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   is that there came a time in our relationship
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   when Kat and I--when we were dating
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   where we just needed to have a clarifying conversation,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and when we clarified the status of the relationship,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   that clarity led to confidence
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   because feelings were out on the table.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   We knew where each other stood.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We knew where we were heading.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   We knew what we both desired,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and we both honestly knew
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   where the relationship was going to end up.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And that clarity led to confidence.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And yet I've been in other situations.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Like, for example, I've shared here at the porch
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   about the time where the girl didn't know
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   if she wanted to keep dating me
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   because she didn't know if she liked how I looked.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Did I tell you all that story?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I told you all about that, right?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah, that was very unsettling.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   That lack of clarity
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   led to a lot of confusion and concern.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So clarity is a really good thing.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And the reason I tell you that
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   is because as we step back into the Gospel of John,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   we are going to look at Jesus Christ
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   having a DTR with a guy named Nicodemus.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And this passage in the Scriptures
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   is so incredibly important
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   because what this passage does
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   is it drives towards relational clarity with Jesus Christ.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   My hope for you is that every person here tonight
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   would leave with great clarity on where you stand with Jesus
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   because when you have clarity on where you stand,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   it can lead to confidence in your relationship with Jesus
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and the relationship can really heat up
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   because you know where you stand,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   you know how each other feels,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and you know where you're going.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   A question that we ask around here at the porch often is,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   if you were to die tonight on a scale of one to ten,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   how sure are you that you would go to heaven when you die?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And I just want you to think real quick.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What would your answer be?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   One to ten.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Just put a number in your mind.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Have that number in your mind.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   What I hope is that many of you right now
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   are picturing the number ten.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But I would imagine that many people here
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   are seeing something different,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   whether it's a nine or a 7.2 or a three.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I want you to be a ten.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Like I want you to have complete confidence
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   in where you stand with Jesus Christ.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But the only way for you to have that confidence
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   is you need clarity on where your relationship stands.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Now some of you have been walking with Jesus for a long time
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and so you're like, "This is where we're going tonight?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   "This is what all we're talking about
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "is how to be sure that you're going to heaven?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   "Here's what I need you to do.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "I need you to hang on because we will go down
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   "a little bit of a theological rabbit hole."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So if that's kind of your thing,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   you can buckle up for that.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   But my greatest hope here is if you personally
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   have great confidence in your relationship with Jesus,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   if you already have that clarity,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   then my hope tonight is that you might get equipped
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   in some way with an urgency to go out and help others
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   find that same clarity that would lead to the same
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   type of confidence that you yourself have.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   So here we go, John chapter three is where we are going to be.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   If you have a Bible, join me there.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   John chapter three, this is a truly famous passage
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   in the scriptures where Jesus has a very, very important
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   conversation with a guy named Nicodemus.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And as we look at this passage, we're just going to identify
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   three things that you need in order to be saved.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Three things that you need in order to be saved.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And it's going to give you the clarity that you need
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   on your relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   so hopefully you can move forward in confidence.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The first thing that you need in order to be saved is this,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   you need more than religion to be saved.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You need more than religion to be saved.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Look with me at the passage, John chapter three,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   let me read you verses one and two,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   because it sets the scene for us.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It says this, "Now there was a man of the Pharisees
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   This man came to Jesus by night and said to him,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   for no one can do these signs that you do
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   unless God is with him.'"
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So this is a very important meeting,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   it's happening at night, a guy named Nicodemus comes to Jesus.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So here's what you need to know,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   the name Nicodemus, it means conqueror of the people.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That's what Nicodemus means, conqueror of the people.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So even just by his name we get the idea
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that this guy is a leader in the nation of Israel.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   But not only that, what we found out in the first verse
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   is that Nicodemus is a Pharisee.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The word Pharisee, it literally means separated one.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So Nicodemus as a Pharisee is really separated
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   from the rest of society in the sense
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   that he is a professional rule follower.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Like he is a part of a religious group
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that spends all of their time
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   seeking to follow God's 613 rules
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   that are expressed in the Old Testament.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But here's what you need to know about Nicodemus and the Pharisees.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They were so all in on following God's rules
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   that they created rules outside of God's rules
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   just to make sure that they did a good job
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   of following God's rules.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And so what do I mean by that?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Well, for example, when it comes to the rule
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   of following and observing the Sabbath,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   the Pharisees, according to one source,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   had 24 chapters on how to observe the Sabbath.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So that's Nicodemus.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But not only that, what does it say about him?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   It says at the end of verse 1
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   that he is a ruler of the Jews.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   What that means is that Nicodemus
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   is probably a part of a group of people
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   known as the Sanhedrin,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   which was 70 members that were,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   in a sense, Israel's Supreme Court.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Not only that, in verse 10,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Jesus refers to Nicodemus as the teacher of Israel.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So when you put all these things together,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   what do we know about Nicodemus?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We know that Nicodemus is, he is an authority.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   He is a religious authority in Israel.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Like, he is the guy that people would be podcasting.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   He is the guy that people would be quoting and reposting.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Nicodemus was a guy that everyone looked to
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   as a religious, as a definition of a person of God.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So who would Nicodemus be today?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Like, if Nicodemus walked into the porch,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   what would he look like?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Well, this would be a guy that in Christian circles
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   would be referred to as a stud or a mog, a man of God.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   This is a guy that would be at church every single Sunday.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Like, if he takes a road trip with his friends,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   he's like, "Guys, I've got to be back either late Saturday night
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   or early Sunday morning because I'm at church.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Like, I'm not just going to, I'm not going to stream it.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Like, I'm going to be there for it."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   He's at the porch every single Tuesday night.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   This is a guy that reads his Bible every single day.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   This is a guy that memorizes Scripture every single week.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   This is a guy that sometimes just dates Jesus.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   This is a guy that when he takes a girl out,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   he's super intense.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He's even intentional because that's how Christian guys are.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They're not, they, trying to be intentional just get intense.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And so they look a girl in the eyes on the first day
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and they're like, "So tell me your story."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And then they end the first day by saying, "I want to pursue you."
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And it just gets really weird really fast.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But that's, that's Nicodemus.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Like, if he's going to cuss, he's going to say things like,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   "What the French toast?"
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   "Son of a biscuit."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And like, those, there's that purity of heart that like,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   if something goes wrong, that's what comes out of his mouth.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   This is who Nicodemus would be today.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And he's having a conversation with Jesus.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You look at a guy like Nicodemus and who I just described,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and it's like, yeah, that's the poster child of
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   what Christianity must look like.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And yet look at what Jesus says to him in verse 3.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   "Jesus answers him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   What an interesting statement for Jesus to say
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   to this very well-respected religious figure.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Here's what you need to know.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Nicodemus would have been viewed as an authority
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   on the kingdom of God.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The kingdom of God was, at least to Jews,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   it was this idea of, at the end of time,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   like this eternal resurrection life.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Jews believed that they were an automatic shoe-in
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   to the kingdom of God unless they were especially evil
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   or had rejected God.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So if anyone knew about the kingdom of God,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   it would have been Nicodemus.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   The nation of Israel would have looked to Nicodemus
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   for teaching on the kingdom of God.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And Jesus looks at Nicodemus in the eyes
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   and he is basically making the point,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   not even you can make it into the kingdom of God
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   unless you're born again.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   What is Jesus communicating to him?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Jesus is having a DTR with him and he's just saying,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   "Look, I want you to know where we stand.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I want you to be clear on your status
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   because the worst thing that could happen is
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   you move forward with a misplaced confidence."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Jesus is in a sense telling him,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   "I don't want you to think you're saved
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   when you're actually not."
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   His point is, "You need a lot more than religion
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   to be saved."
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   So do you know what Nicodemus shows us?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   What he's showing us is it is possible
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   to be an unsaved Christian.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Now, some of you think I just spoke heresy,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   so let me just clarify quickly.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   What I mean when I say that it's possible
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   to be an unsaved Christian is I'm talking about
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   people in this room who consider themselves Christians
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   because they are religious.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   But in reality, they are not saved
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   because they don't actually have a saving relationship
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Now, hey, look, my goal tonight is to make--
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   my goal isn't to make truly saved people
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   really, really nervous.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   My goal is just to have a clarifying conversation
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   with a few of you.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And so I just want to make sure that you're not
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   an unsaved Christian.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I just want you to put yourself in that place
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   late at night when you're laying in bed
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and you've finally put your phone down
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and on a rare occasion you can't sleep
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   because you are wondering about your eternal destiny.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I don't know if you've ever had that night.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   That's a good night.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   That's an important night for you to have.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   But if in that moment, if you're wondering,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   if you were to die, would you go to heaven,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   are you asking the question, "Have I done enough?"
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   In that moment, are you asking, "Have I done enough?"
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Or are you asking the question, "Have I been good enough?"
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   If you've ever asked that question, "Have I done enough?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Let me answer it for you."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   No.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   In fact, you can never do enough.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   If you're asking the question, "Have I been good enough?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Let me answer it for you."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   No.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   No, you haven't.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And you know what?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   You can never be good enough for God.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   So that's clarity right there.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Welcome to the porch.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Aren't you glad you came?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   You're not good enough and you haven't done enough.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Man, what a polite crowd to applaud that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But man, this is where we can actually go somewhere.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Because the great news is that while you could never do enough for God,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   the good news is that God has done everything for you.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And even though you could never be good enough for God,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   you know what the great news is?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Is God has been good enough for you.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   In the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   When we could do nothing, God did everything.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   He sent Jesus Christ into the world.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   To do what?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   To live the life that we couldn't.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   The perfect life that God required.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   He died a perfect death so that imperfect people could be made right
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   through His resurrection with a perfect God.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But if you're here tonight and you're wrestling with those questions,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   have I done enough or am I good enough?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I want you to see the fact that Nicodemus, this religious figure,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   he came to visit Jesus at night.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And I loved what one commentator pointed out is that there's symbolism there.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That he is coming to Jesus from darkness.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   That a guy who believes he's living and knows the light is coming to the light
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   of the world in darkness.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That his heart has never embraced the truth.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And so I tell you that just to say it is possible to be religious and living
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   in darkness.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It's possible to say you're a Christian and to think you're a Christian
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and to not be a Christian.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   And I'll just say, look, my tendency is to be a rule follower.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   My tendency is to figure out if I'm good with God based on how I am living.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And it's just so easy to find yourself in this place where you're like,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   "Well, you know what?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I'm not looking at porn.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I'm not getting wasted.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I'm not sleeping around and I go to the porch sometimes so I think I'm good."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   You just need to make sure that God is in heaven looking at you saying,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   "Yeah, you're good."
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Because the reality is I believe that God is saying no one is good.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   The reason I believe that is because Romans chapter 3 actually says that.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And so we have to start with the reality that you will need way more than religion
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   to be saved.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Number two, you need a miracle to be saved.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Like you need a miracle to be saved.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Where do I get that from?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Okay, look with me back at the text.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Verse 3, look again at what Jesus said.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   "Jesus answered him and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   That word "again" in the original language of the Bible, which is Greek,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   that word "again" can be translated from "above."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   So I think it can carry both meanings.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   What Jesus is communicating to this professional rule follower is no one can be saved
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   unless they have a second birth and are actually born from above.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Every person that's going to be saved has to have two births,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   a physical birth and then a spiritual birth.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Look at how Nicodemus responds.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Verse 4, "Nicodemus said to him, 'How can a man be born when he's old?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?'"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Now this isn't Nicodemus like genuinely wondering, like, "How does that work?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Like, how do you kind of like fit up in there to like come back out?"
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Like, that's not what is happening here.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   This is Nicodemus, a guy who thinks he knows everything.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And he is responding kind of sarcastically.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   What are you even talking about?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Are you talking crazy like, "Oh, you're going to climb back up in your mom
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and then you're going to come back out."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   But what I want you to see is his logic.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Nicodemus is consumed with what man needs to do for God to be saved.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Even in his sarcastic response, "Who is all the responsibility on?"
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It's on the man.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   "How can a man be born when he's old?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   All of the emphasis would be on the guy doing the work.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And the point is that's impossible.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Just like it's impossible for a man to climb back up into his mother's womb
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and be born again, it is impossible.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   It is impossible for you to be saved without being born from above,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   without a spiritual birth.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   You need a miracle.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Jesus goes on in verse 5, and he says the same thing he said in verse 3.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Look at what he says.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   He's saying the same thing with new wording.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Some people think that he's talking about baptism here.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   I don't think he is.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   See, water in the Old Testament was symbolic for cleansing,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and Spirit was symbolic of new life.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And so what Jesus is saying is, he's like, "Unless you're cleansed by God
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and unless you're given new life by God, you can't enter the kingdom of God."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So then in verse 6, he says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   So his point is, look, you have to have two births.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You need to be born of the flesh as a human being,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   but then you have to be born of the Spirit.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   The Spirit of God actually has to do a miraculous work in you.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   So here's the theological rabbit hole.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Here's a big theological word that's important for you to know.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   What Jesus is unpacking here is known as the theological idea
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   of regeneration of the Spirit of God.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   What does regeneration mean?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Well, let me just read you what two scholars, how they've defined regeneration.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So for those of you that like kind of the theological rabbit hole,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   this is your moment, and if you're kind of not into that,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   try and hang in there anyway, because this is so important.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Wayne Grudem, who has kind of written the standard text
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   on what is known as systematic theology.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Some of you are like, "You are giving me so much stuff
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   that I don't want to know right now."
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   But here's what Wayne Grudem says about regeneration.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   He says, "Regeneration is a secret act of God
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   in which he imparts new spiritual life to us."
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Bruce Demarest puts it this way,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   "Regeneration is that work of the Spirit at conversion
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that renews the heart and life, the inner self,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   thus restoring the person's intellectual, volitional, moral, emotional,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and relational capacities to do what?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   To know, love, and serve God."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   So do you understand what's happening here?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   When Jesus says you have to be born again,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   he really is saying a miracle has to happen.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   God has to do something miraculous through his Spirit in your life.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So no one here who is a Christian,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   you're not a Christian simply because you heard the gospel,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   you evaluated the gospel, and you decided to choose God.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   That's part of it.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Part of it, the way God works is you come to a place like this
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and you hear the gospel, and you respond to the gospel.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   But as you're hearing the gospel and responding to the gospel,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   which is what you should do,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   a miracle is taking place in your heart.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   The Spirit of God is awakening your mind and your heart
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   to embrace the truth and to receive Jesus.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   This is the idea of regeneration.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   So if you're a Christian, you just need to know
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   you are actually a walking miracle, and God gets the credit for you.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And some of you are like, "I don't know what I think about what you're saying."
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Well, think about physical birth.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   If you were to walk up to me afterward, and you were to ask me,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "Hey, where were you born?"
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Would it be weird to you if I was like,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   "You know what, I chose to be born in Dallas."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Wouldn't you be like, "Really?"
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   No, I don't take credit for where I was born.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Carla Atik gets the credit for that.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Okay?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I was born in Medical City right down the street.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I did not choose Medical City.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   That is the place that my mom chose to give birth to me.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   The Scriptures, the reason that you have to understand it's a miracle
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   is that the story of every Christian is not that you are a bad person
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   and now you have become a good person.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   The story is you were a dead person, and now you are an alive person.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And you are alive because when you were dead,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   God did a miracle so that you could go from death to life.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So you need a miracle.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And you know what the good news is?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   God loves doing miracles.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And He's doing a miracle in some of your hearts tonight.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Like some of you just heard me talk about you needing more than religion to be saved,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and you're like, "He's talking about me tonight!"
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You know what's happening?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   A miracle is happening.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Regeneration is happening.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   God is calling you to Himself tonight.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Tonight you're going to walk out of this place,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and you're going to be able to say, "I showed up dead, and I left alive.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   This was a great Tuesday night."
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   [Applause]
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Now I want you to see what Jesus says in verses 7 and 8.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because what I want you to--this is where--
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Again, I'm not trying to cause unnecessary concern,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and yet I am trying to fight for clarity.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   I'm trying to prompt a DTR between you and Jesus,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   because Jesus says something very important here in verses 7 and 8
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   that has everything to do with you needing a miracle to be saved.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Because in verse 7 He says, "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear it sound,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   What is He saying there?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He's saying, "Think about the wind.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   You can't see the wind, and yet you can hear it, and you can see its effects.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You can look at the trees, and you can say, 'There is wind.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I can't see it, but I know it is at work.'"
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And so Jesus' point is, when a miracle takes place,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   you can't see the Spirit, you can't even completely understand how the Spirit is working,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and yet you know it when a miracle has taken place, because something changes.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   So the reason that that is important is if you--
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   if God has done a miracle in your life, if He's given you new life,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   then there should be some signs of life.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Like, I remember when one of our kids was born,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   he came out of the womb, and they put him on cat,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and he was laying there making no sound.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   He looked lifeless.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Like, it was deafening silence in the delivery room.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And then they prompted him, and he began to cry,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and it was the best sound that we could have heard.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Why? Because there were signs of life.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   We knew that he was alive.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And I tell you that just to say, "Look, there's going to be times in the Christian life where you struggle.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   There's going to be times absolutely where you have doubts.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   There's going to be times where you might even look lifeless,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and you're going to come to the porch,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   and you just need to be spurred on and kind of stimulated to go and walk closer with Jesus
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   so that there's more signs of life."
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   But my point in telling you this is if you consider yourself a Christian
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   and you prayed a prayer once, or you raised your hair somewhere,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   or raised not your hair but your hands somewhere,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   or you got baptized when you were an infant,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   but you consistently look spiritually dead,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   meaning there is no real desire to know Jesus,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   there is no real love or appreciation for Jesus,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   there's no real desire to learn the ways of Jesus,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   and live life with Jesus,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   then it is at least worth evaluating.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   If a miracle has ever taken place.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I remember getting a note from a guy who trusted Christ.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   He said, "I was overcome by a world of joy.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I found my Lord and Savior for the first time in my life.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I have clarity and I'm at peace.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   God broke chains that were keeping me a prisoner to my past.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   These were chains that I thought were too strong for me or anyone else.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Man, I was wrong.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I want to spend the rest of my life serving our Lord and Savior and all that I do.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I want to plant the seed in others just like you and countless others did for me.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   A fire is burning in my heart for the first time."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Do you know what he's articulating?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   He's just articulating, "Hey, a miracle has happened in my life.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Please don't hear me say that you won't struggle as a Christian.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   You will. In this world, you will have trouble."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And here's the other thing I want you to hear.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   You will never have to beg God to make you alive.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Never.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   You'll never have to beg God to make you alive.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   If you're begging God to make you alive, you probably already are alive.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And you should take joy in that.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So, three things.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Number one, you need more than religion to be saved.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Number two, you need a miracle to be saved.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And then number three, you need a biblical faith in Jesus to be saved.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   You need a--and the key here is you need a biblical faith in Jesus to be saved.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Where do I get that from? Look with me.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Verses 9 through 13.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   It says, "Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can these things be?'
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Jesus answered him, 'Are you the teacher of Israel?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And yet you do not understand these things?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   but you do not receive our testimony.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?'"
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   This is so powerful, guys. Don't miss what's happening here.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Nicodemus is like, "I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And Jesus is like, "Really?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Like, you're the one teaching the country about the kingdom of God."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And Jesus is saying, "Let me just tell you what has happened here."
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He says, "I am the only one," because there was this belief in Judaism
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   that some bygone saints had ascended into heaven
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and received special insights into God's ways and plans.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And Jesus is like, "Look, I just want to be clear.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I am the only one who started out there and came down here.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   People might leave here to go there,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   but I'm the only one who started out there and came down to here."
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And he refers to himself as the Son of Man.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Do you know why that's important?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   That's actually a reference to the Old Testament, Daniel chapter 7,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and it's a reference to kingship.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   So when Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   he's referring to himself as the king of God's kingdom.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   They're talking about how to get into the kingdom of God.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And Demas would have been an authority on the kingdom of God.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And Jesus is basically saying, "Look, dude,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   the king of the kingdom is standing here telling you the truth."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And you're like, "No, I don't know. We'll see."
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He's like, "Something's off here. You're not getting it."
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And he's saying, "Look, if you don't understand the elementary things
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   that I'm telling you, that you have to be born again to enter the kingdom,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   then how in the world is your mind going to comprehend truly heavenly things?"
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   He's saying, "Look, I came from heaven.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I know the Spirit of God because the Spirit of God and I are one.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   I know that the Spirit of God has come to give new life to people.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I was there in heaven. I'm one with God. I know what's happening."
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And yet you, Nicodemus, are standing here saying, "Yeah, I don't get it."
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And that just goes back to the first point, that a miracle has to take place.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I shared with you guys earlier this year that I want to become the goat
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   in the 42-year-old age bracket of tennis in Richardson, Texas.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And it's a long journey for me.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   But when I really got back into tennis at the age of 40,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I started taking lessons from this person.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I was two lessons in. I barely knew what I was doing.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   But I then began to try and teach my 9-year-old how to play tennis.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And so we were in the front yard, and he started holding the racket
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   with his pointer finger along the racket.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And I was like, "Hey, dude, you're not holding the racket right."
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And he was like, "Yes, I am!"
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   This is what he said.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   He's like, "I'm holding it right!" I was like, "Dude, no, you're not."
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   He's like, "Yes, I am! I'm holding it right!"
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   I was like, "No, dude, you're running your pointer finger along the racket."
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   He's like, "No, I'm not!"
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   I was like, "Dude, I watched you do it."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   He was like, "No, I didn't!"
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I was like, "OK."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And so then he hit another ball, and he did it again.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I was like, "Hey, hey, look! Look at your grip!"
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And he looked down, and he goes,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "Oh."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And I was like, "You ever read the story of Nicodemus?"
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   "Not really, I didn't do that."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   But he became a Christian right then, and it was a really powerful moment.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's the same thing with Nicodemus.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   It's like, "Hey, dude, if you won't even accept what I'm teaching you
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   about how to hold a tennis racket, it doesn't get any more elementary than that.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   If you won't accept that, how in the world are we going to begin
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   to be able to talk about forehands or backhands or spin or anything like that?"
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And it's the same thing with Nicodemus here.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   He's like, "Look, if you won't understand that at the base level,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   you have to understand that religion will not get you there,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and a miracle has to take place, and you're just not going to get it.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   A miracle has to happen. Eyes have to be opened."
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And so what has to happen is you have to come to a place
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   where you realize that Jesus Christ is the King of the kingdom.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And what Jesus is saying is, "Look, I'm telling you the truth.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   You have to come to a place.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   When I talk about having a biblical faith in Jesus,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I'm talking about coming to a place where you trust what Jesus has said.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And you embrace it, you accept it.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Like, for example, Jesus declares in John 10, 30, "I and the Father are one."
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   That is Jesus declaring that He is in fact God.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   John 14, 6, Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   No one comes to the Father except through Me."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   John 3, 3, "Truly I say to you, unless one is born again,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   he can't see the kingdom of God."
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   A biblical faith doesn't sit there and say,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   "Well, you know what, that's good for you, and that might be true for you,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and I might believe something different,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   but we all, in the end, we end up at the same place."
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   No, you either believe that Jesus is the King of the kingdom,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   which means He is the holder of truth.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And if He says it, it's right, or not.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   A biblical faith sees Jesus as the truth.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   If Jesus is the truth, then to reject any of Him is to reject all of Him.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Do you hear what I'm saying?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   To reject any of Jesus is to reject all of Him.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   To only accept Jesus as Savior,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   but to refuse to acknowledge Him as King is to reject Jesus.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   To know Jesus as a way, but not the way, is to reject Jesus.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   To know Jesus as a good man or a prophet,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   but not God Himself is to reject Jesus.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Do you know the true Jesus?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And then look at how Jesus finishes in verses 14 and 15.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   He says, "And as Moses," this is so interesting,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He says, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life."
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Here's what Jesus is doing here.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   He's reaching back into the Old Testament in the book of Numbers
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   that I'm sure all of y'all are reading in your quiet times right now.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Numbers 21, it's a story about the nation of Israel
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   being disobedient to God,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   and God punishes them for their disobedience.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And it's kind of this interesting story where God sends some snakes to bite Him,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   and because of the venom, people of the nation of Israel die.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   And you might hear that and think, "Well, that's super harsh.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   That's why I can't believe in God."
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   No, you have to understand, it's not harsh.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   It's just.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Because if God is holy, holy, holy, like we just sang that He is,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   if He is perfect and right and true,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   then to just turn a blind eye and just let people have their way
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   would be unjust.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   No, He executes justice.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And at the same time, you know what He does?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   He provides a means of salvation.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   What Moses does is he erects this staff with a snake on it.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And what God says is that if you look,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   if you look at the staff, you will live.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   It's look and live.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Look and live.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   So God in His kindness, He makes provision for the venom
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   that people are experiencing.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   That is our story.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Every single one of us has been bitten with the venom of sin.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   The venom of sin courses through our veins.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And God has provided Jesus as the means for new life.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And His Spirit is the one who accomplishes that new life.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Our responsibility is to look and live.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   What does it mean to look to Jesus?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   It's to come to a place.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   A biblical faith is coming to a place where you are desperate for Jesus
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   to save you through His death, burial, and resurrection.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   It's like this.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Several years ago, I went skydiving.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And we were doing it as skit characters for this deal here at Watermark.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And I was skydiving with David Penuel, a guy on staff.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And we were dressed up as characters.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   We were wearing mullets, and we had taped on Fu Manchu's.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   And I am about to jump out of the plane.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And right before I jump, David Penuel asks the instructors,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   "Hey, have you ever had to use the emergency parachute?"
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And the guy was like, "Yes."
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And I was like, "Oh, geez. Oh, man. I can't do this."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Here's the reality.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   The parachute of your good works has failed.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   The parachute of you trying to earn your way into heaven has failed.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   The parachute of you just being a good person has failed.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And some of y'all are free-falling right now, and you think it's enjoyable.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You just need to know that at the same time you're enjoying the free-fall,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   that free-fall is leading.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   It is a crash course toward death.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   So every single one of us desperately needs Jesus.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   To know Jesus is to know him as the only one who can save you.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And without him, you are without hope.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   A biblical faith is a faith that says, "Jesus, I want to live.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And without you, I can't. And without you, I won't."
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   And so here's what I want to do.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   I just want to end by talking to four different groups of people in this room.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Number one, some of y'all are here tonight, and for the first time,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   a miracle is taking place in your life, and for the first time,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   you've realized that religion will not cut it.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And you came in here, and the DTR has been clear
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   that you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   and you want to begin a relationship with him.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   The right response is to look to Jesus and live.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   It is to receive him as a free gift tonight.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Some of you here came into this place,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   and you thought that you were a Christian,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   and tonight you realize that you are an unsaved Christian.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Because the reality is that you were looking to what you've done
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   or how good you are to make you right with God.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   If that's you, if you've realized that you are an unsaved Christian,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   it's the same response. Receive Jesus. Look to Jesus and live.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Some of you here came tonight,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   and when you think about that on a scale of one to ten,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   how sure are you if you were to die, you'd go to heaven?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   You always say nine because it just feels too prideful to say ten,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   and something's just a little bit nervous in you.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And yet your faith is genuine.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You've known that Jesus is your only way to a right relationship with God.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   If that's you, my hope is that you can just rest,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   and you can experience the joy of knowing
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   that God has done a miracle in your life.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Enjoy it. Be thankful for it.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   And walk in confidence of where your relationship is.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And then some of you are here, and you walked in,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and you're like, "I'm a ten out of ten,"
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and your faith has been strong for a long time.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Well, let me just ask you, when is the last time
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   that you just said thank you for the miracle
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   that God has accomplished in your life,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   even just sitting down front during worship?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   I was just thinking, "God, have I really embraced this talk?"
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And so I just sat there, and I was like,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   "God, thank you that I couldn't earn it.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Thank you for the miracle that you have done in my life.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   And Jesus, I am desperate without you."
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Lord, I pray that you would just have your way
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   in this room tonight,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   that every person here would respond in some way, God.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And so for the people in the room
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   that want to put their trust in Jesus right now,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   then here's what I want to encourage you to do.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Just in the quietness of your own heart,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   you can just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?"
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Just say, "Jesus, I receive you.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   I receive all of you tonight."
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Just say, "Jesus, thank you that you died on the cross for me.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Would you come into my life?
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And would you begin to lead me in a new life?"
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And then for everyone else in the room,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   would you just respond?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Respond with gratitude.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Praise God for the miracle he's done in your life.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Praise God for your salvation.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   We're going to respond with worship.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   There's going to be people down front.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   If you need to talk to someone, pray with someone, get more clarity,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   there will be a team down front.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   If after we finish, you would benefit from just some extended worship,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   you can go up to the chapel and do that.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   If you want to take your next step with the church,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   whether it's through membership or finding a place to plug in, community,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   you can go over to the loft, go to our Next Steps.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   If you don't have a Bible, you can go out to the welcome desk.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   We'd love to give you a copy of the Word of God.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   But this is a time for everyone to feel the freedom to just respond.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   My hope is that you'd have clarity in this moment,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   and that clarity would lead to confidence.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   [music]
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.580]   (gentle music)
