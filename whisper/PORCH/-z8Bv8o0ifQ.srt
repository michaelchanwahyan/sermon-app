1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:24,840
 Spiritual war, words and wonders.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,420
 Man, the unseen.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,120
 Hello porch, how you doing man?

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,120
 It is awesome to be with you.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,080
 I wanted to jump in on this series

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,240
 because I love you guys.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,200
 And because this truth that we're talking about right here

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,560
 is gonna make the difference between death and life for you.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,520
 And it's also one of the areas that is most misunderstood,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,600
 which doesn't surprise me.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,620
 If we've got an enemy and he is at war with us,

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,780
 one of the greatest things that he can do

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,340
 is to convince you that he's something that he's not

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,740
 or that he attacks you in ways that he doesn't.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,880
 Because if you believe he's something that he's not,

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,680
 man, it's hard to resist what you believe doesn't exist.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
 And it's also hard to fight against an enemy

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
 when you think the enemy's fighting this way

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,920
 when he's really fighting that way.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,200
 And I'm telling you something, there is a fight

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,840
 and you are to be of sober spirit,

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,560
 which means don't be drunk on bad theology,

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,800
 on bad teaching, on imaginary ideas.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,000
 Means you be sober, you be clear thinking.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,720
 You be on the alert 'cause you have an adversary, the devil.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,760
 Do you guys know this?

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,760
 60% of Christians don't believe in the devil.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,240
 They think of him as some kind of just idea

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,840
 or some abstract representation.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,960
 In fact, what's so even crazier

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,920
 is almost that many believers think

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,600
 that the Holy Spirit is not a person, it's an it.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,300
 They're more informed by Star Wars theology,

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,200
 this impersonal force that you activate

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
 more than understand that God is a living being.

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,880
 And when you don't understand the power of God

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,320
 and you don't understand the threat of your enemy,

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,800
 man, you are cooked and you're gonna start to look like

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,040
 the way people stereotypically say your generation looks.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
 And I love you guys.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,440
 And truth sets you free.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,680
 There's an enemy, he's come to steal, kill, and destroy.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,200
 He is stealing your future.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,440
 He is killing your hope.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
 He is destroying your self-respect.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
 He's destroying your relationships.

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,560
 He's destroying family before your eyes.

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,160
 Over 50% of all children born to your generation

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,800
 are born into single-family households.

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
 Why?

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 Because you bought a lie.

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,980
 And I love you guys,

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,040
 and we're gonna give you some truth, all right?

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
 And it's gonna set you free.

56
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,240
 Man, truth is always compassionate when you share it

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
 'cause it sets people free.

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,400
 But truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth.

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,520
 Right?

60
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,280
 And so when you speak the truth, you do it in love

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,720
 because truth said in hate won't be heard.

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
 But love without truth is not love, folks.

63
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,600
 And your generation has too few truth tellers in it,

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,000
 which is why I love the porch

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,340
 'cause you guys get some truth here, amen?

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,180
 There's some truth.

67
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,000
 Now listen, you might be there like,

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
 okay, well, let's just hear what kind of truth you got.

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
 Let me give you some truth, okay?

70
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,080
 One of the things that I loved to do when I was a kid

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,500
 is we would share ghost stories, right?

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,280
 'Cause I kind of love the feeling of being scared.

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,180
 When I was a kid, I didn't know any better, right?

74
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,660
 And so I love getting scared.

75
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,400
 And we would tell stories, and we would get freaked out,

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
 and we would go see movies.

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,280
 I mean, back then, "The Night of the Living Dead,"

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
 the very first zombie movie,

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,880
 it was first a black and white film.

80
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,000
 I can remember watching that at a drive-in

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,960
 before I hit puberty, and it freaked me out, man.

82
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,220
 That's all I can tell you.

83
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,400
 And it should have because you're not supposed to sit there

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 and have your mind meditate on that kind of craziness

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
 and that kind of evil.

86
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,360
 But if you think about classic horror films,

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 if you think about the movie that set it all on fire,

88
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,080
 that really got it all going on,

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
 it was a movie that starred this guy right there.

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
 Frankenstein.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,760
 That's what got it all going.

92
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,600
 Now listen, here's the deal.

93
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,640
 You guys know this, not because you're scholars,

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
 not because you did your homework when you were

95
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,080
 in high school, but because there's a movie

96
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,120
 that come out recently, and you probably know

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
 who wrote Frankenstein, right?

98
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,280
 Because you now know that there's Bram Stoker's "Dracula,"

99
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,280
 and there is Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," right?

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
 'Cause you read the Spark Notes to a book, right?

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
 Remember?

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,120
 Yeah, you did.

103
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,880
 So let me tell you about Mary Shelley,

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,080
 'cause here's the thing.

105
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,680
 What you need to know is that the horror genre

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,960
 really came out of the sexual revolution.

107
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,600
 What?

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,320
 Watch this.

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
 Here's the real monster.

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
 Check out this good-looking cat.

111
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,200
 This brother, if he was at the porch, right here, not him,

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
 this guy.

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 (congregation laughing)

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,360
 If that other brother's at the porch too,

115
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
 he'd say, "Get on out of here, old man.

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
 "All right, this ain't for you."

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,040
 But that guy, that is the real monster.

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,080
 That good-looking cat right there is Percy Shelley.

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,260
 Percy Shelley was a Romantist poet who was part

120
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,940
 of the Enlightened Movement.

121
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,940
 Percy Shelley had an affair with one little girl named Mary

122
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,740
 who gallivanted with him all over Europe.

123
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,100
 Percy Shelley remained married and had an affair with Mary.

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,600
 And as they traveled around, more and more,

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,900
 more despairing became Percy's wife

126
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,820
 until ultimately she killed herself.

127
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,860
 This Romantic poet, betrayed the love of his life,

128
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,900
 taught about enlightenment and rationalism

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
 and finding hope in the human way,

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,520
 a way that seems right to man,

131
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,780
 but in the end leads to death.

132
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,220
 And it led to the death of his first wife.

133
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,600
 And it led to the terrorization of his second wife,

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,540
 whom he married, one Mary Shelley,

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,220
 who he encouraged to have an open marriage,

136
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,860
 to have sex with his friends.

137
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,500
 Let me just tell you the story of Frankenstein

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
 in case you forgot it.

139
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,140
 "Brick to Frankenstein," the book starts

140
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,840
 with a guy sailing up towards Antarctica

141
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,620
 and they find this guy in Antarctica roaming

142
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,100
 and they bring him on the boat and he's almost dead.

143
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,980
 His name is Victor Frankenstein.

144
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,820
 And Frankenstein goes on to tell Robert Walton,

145
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,100
 the man who was on this expedition to the North Pole,

146
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,020
 his story.

147
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,260
 He says that he left his family, he became isolated,

148
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,940
 and he sought for truth in isolation.

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,900
 Apart from any other revelation or any other moral compass,

150
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,180
 Victor Frankenstein sought to educate himself and find more.

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,420
 Now remember who's writing this, who's writing this?

152
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,180
 Percy Shelley's adulterous relationship wife.

153
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:56,060
 And there is a guy that tells his rescuer, Robert Walton,

154
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,580
 that he has figured out a way to bestow animation

155
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,260
 upon lifeless manner.

156
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,420
 In other words, he has learned to create life

157
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,060
 on his own terms apart from God.

158
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,260
 That's what Victor Frankenstein has done.

159
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,220
 If you follow the story of Victor Frankenstein,

160
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,140
 you see that his experiment goes horribly wrong

161
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,780
 because the monster that he creates,

162
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,620
 he was not pleased with the way that he looked.

163
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,820
 In other words, the life that he got

164
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,780
 when he created life apart from God

165
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,060
 was a life that to him even became ugly.

166
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,900
 And so the monster was cast out.

167
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,300
 If you remember the story, he roamed around

168
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 and he saw a family led by a blind man.

169
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,140
 It was a compassionate man who taught his children to read

170
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,660
 and Frankenstein would peer through the window

171
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,900
 and learn to read and learn how human relationships work

172
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,260
 by watching this compassionate blind man

173
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,000
 who didn't see the way others see,

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,100
 but saw something else, real beauty in individuals.

175
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,260
 And Frankenstein eventually had the courage one day

176
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,300
 to go in and talk to this man because the man was blind,

177
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,260
 he didn't see the ugliness of the life that was created

178
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,140
 and he loved Frankenstein,

179
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,220
 but then this man's children came home,

180
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,640
 saw him and beat him and he ran away, the monster did.

181
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,600
 And he was angry.

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
 And so watch what happens,

183
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,620
 I don't have time to go into the whole story,

184
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,520
 but bottom line, what starts to happen

185
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
 is Victor Frankenstein's buddy,

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,520
 his actually his younger brother,

187
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,760
 destroyed by the life that he created.

188
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,640
 His best friend destroyed by the life that he created.

189
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,440
 His father, seeing the horror that had come to his family

190
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,320
 through the life that his son had created,

191
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,940
 died in grief.

192
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,020
 Are you seeing a theme here?

193
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,780
 And the monster found Victor Frankenstein,

194
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,020
 said I'm not gonna kill you right now,

195
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,380
 but I know you love this dear woman

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,260
 and on your wedding night, I will haunt you.

197
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,860
 You think what you do and what you create

198
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,100
 and the truth that you believe

199
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,460
 won't haunt you on your wedding night?

200
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,620
 You think the sexual revolution

201
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,100
 that you celebrate Percy Shelley

202
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,380
 won't haunt you on your wedding night?

203
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,780
 Mary Shelley is writing a story about what happens

204
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,960
 when men in his enlightened state

205
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,480
 says this is the beautiful life.

206
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,280
 No, it's a monster and it destroys your family,

207
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,020
 it destroys your friends, it destroys your wedding.

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,140
 You think I'm crazy?

209
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,200
 Let me just tell you something else.

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
 I already, you knew because they titled the movie

211
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,960
 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

212
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,520
 I said it myself, I'll say it again.

213
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
 Who wrote Dracula?

214
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,500
 Bram Stoker's Dracula.

215
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,520
 You know what Dracula is?

216
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
 Same guy, came right in the exact same enlightenment.

217
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,540
 During the enlightenment, men were adulterous

218
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,260
 and believed that they should find their satisfaction

219
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,300
 in what made sense to man.

220
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,660
 And so what happened is that during the enlightenment,

221
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,380
 all of a sudden there was an infection

222
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,300
 that came in the blood of men.

223
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
 Syphilis ran through them.

224
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,820
 And there were innocent women

225
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,000
 who had through blood transmission

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,660
 and bodily fluid transmission,

227
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,660
 that infection transmitted to them.

228
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,760
 Dracula, what is it?

229
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,140
 It's a novel about a vampire

230
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,700
 who infects the blood of innocent girls.

231
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,060
 Bram Stoker had syphilis.

232
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,400
 Let me tell you guys something, all right?

233
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,880
 When you try and find life apart from God,

234
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,960
 when you like Victor Frankenstein,

235
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,480
 bestow animation upon a lifeless matter,

236
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,560
 in other words, when you try and make life exist

237
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,720
 where life doesn't exist, it always leads to death.

238
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
 There is no other life except for the life

239
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,960
 that God gives you and he loves you

240
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,480
 and so he's calling you into a relationship with him.

241
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,900
 Mary Shelley wrote an amazing book

242
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,020
 that you ought to go back and read

243
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,800
 'cause I know you didn't read it in high school.

244
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,380
 You ought to go back and read the book

245
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,500
 and you ought to read it through the lens

246
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,540
 of the girl who wrote it.

247
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,040
 When men lead in a way that seems right to men,

248
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,600
 it ruins my life.

249
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,700
 This woman was sexually tormented

250
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,660
 and she said, "Your monster has ruined my life.

251
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,000
 "It killed your first wife.

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,220
 "And it showed up on our wedding night and it's killing me."

253
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,940
 (whistles)

254
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,820
 Man, there is an enemy and you ought to know him

255
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,120
 and you ought to be on the alert

256
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,260
 and it is a hard story.

257
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,100
 Let me tell you something, man.

258
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,380
 If you don't believe there is an enemy that is out there,

259
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,080
 you won't resist him.

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,420
 You can't resist what you don't believe exists.

261
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,620
 And when you're not sober and on the alert

262
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,060
 because you don't know that there's an adversary

263
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,900
 who wants to destroy you or when you think

264
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,800
 you need to fight him in a way that you shouldn't fight him

265
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,820
 because you've bought into some myth,

266
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,280
 you're gonna get your clock cleaned.

267
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,620
 So we're gonna give you some truth tonight.

268
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,520
 I'm gonna give you seven truths to defeat the liar.

269
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
 Are you ready?

270
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,380
 Let's go.

271
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,620
 Number one, there is no secret about what's coming

272
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,300
 or who it's coming from.

273
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,900
 Now this is really important.

274
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
 The very first thing I'm gonna tell you

275
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,060
 is that what's coming is a lie.

276
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,100
 You guys don't probably sing a lot of hymns anymore.

277
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,940
 That's okay.

278
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,260
 We sing different kinds of hymns.

279
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,020
 We sing beautiful music that focuses on the goodness of God

280
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,980
 and we learn about God's character and nature.

281
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,460
 There was a guy, you're gonna hear more about him

282
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,600
 because 500 years ago this October,

283
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,120
 we're gonna celebrate what he did

284
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
 where he posted his thesis on a door in 1517.

285
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 Is that right?

286
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,800
 No, let's go back in 500 minus.

287
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,640
 Yeah, that's right.

288
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,160
 1517 in Wittenberg, all right?

289
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,400
 He put his 95 thesis up there

290
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,920
 and that 95 thesis was 95 things wrong

291
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,080
 with the way men are representing God on earth.

292
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
 Martin Luther.

293
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,120
 Martin Luther wrote a song called

294
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,920
 "A Mighty Fortress is Our God."

295
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,560
 And in that song, he talks about our enemy, the devil.

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,840
 And he says in there, "One single word shall fell him."

297
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,840
 You know what the single word is that shall fell the enemy?

298
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,360
 It's not be gone 'cause that's two words, all right?

299
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
 It's liar.

300
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,200
 Liar.

301
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,840
 That's the word Luther had in mind.

302
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,320
 'Cause Luther knew it's the truth that will set you free.

303
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
 Let me just tell you something.

304
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,520
 If you think your interaction with the enemy

305
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,800
 is a power encounter,

306
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,640
 you're gonna look to bring power to bear.

307
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,480
 It's not a power encounter.

308
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,000
 It is a truth encounter.

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,220
 This is so significant, okay?

310
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,780
 This is the thing you gotta understand.

311
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,400
 There should be no surprise about what's coming

312
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,500
 or who it's coming from.

313
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,040
 What's coming is a lie.

314
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,960
 He is a liar.

315
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,200
 He's been that way from the beginning.

316
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
 John chapter eight, verse 44.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
 "You," he says, "to false religious teachers,

318
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,220
 "some of whom today exist and teach you the wrong way

319
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,960
 "to do war against the enemy."

320
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,920
 Jesus is saying to these guys,

321
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,040
 "You are of your father, the devil,

322
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,520
 "and you want to do the desires of your father.

323
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
 "He was a murderer from the beginning.

324
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,220
 "He came to steal, kill, and destroy.

325
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,660
 "And he does not stand in the truth

326
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,340
 "because there is no truth in him.

327
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,740
 "Whenever he speaks, he speaks a lie.

328
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,400
 "He speaks from his own nature,

329
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,120
 "for he is a liar and the father of lies."

330
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,140
 Which means whenever somebody starts to tell you something

331
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,360
 about this is where life can be found,

332
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,820
 whether it's with a poem and a rose,

333
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,520
 or sweet seduction or a soft caress,

334
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,920
 what you wanna do is ask,

335
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,660
 "Is this action being informed by the author of love

336
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,120
 "and the God who cares for me

337
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,640
 "and withholds no good things from those who love him?"

338
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,620
 If you cannot trace back what this individual is doing

339
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,900
 to the word of God, you can be sure he is selling a lie.

340
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,060
 And if you follow it,

341
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,000
 you're gonna find what Mary Shelley found,

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
 that that man who says he loves you,

343
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,500
 that romantic poet who is sweeping you down a current

344
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,860
 of a relationship is going to be a monster

345
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,060
 and it will destroy you.

346
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,160
 What is coming is a lie.

347
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,660
 God isn't good, his word's not true.

348
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,140
 Disobeying him is not that big a deal.

349
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,660
 Go back, he shows up in your Bible in Genesis 3,

350
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,540
 and that's what he does.

351
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,260
 He challenges the truth of God's word,

352
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,700
 he challenges your knowledge of it,

353
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,620
 and you're vulnerable to him

354
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,220
 if you don't know what truth is.

355
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,380
 He challenges the idea of judgment,

356
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,360
 he challenges the idea that God cares about you,

357
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,120
 because he is a liar.

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,020
 What is coming, what is coming from him is temptation.

359
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,940
 And it's coming to your flesh,

360
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,020
 which because you are a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve,

361
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,520
 your flesh is corrupted,

362
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,940
 which means we're all born with a sin nature.

363
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,060
 Now, this is really important.

364
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,940
 We live in a fallen world that is inhabited by a deceiver,

365
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,860
 and our flesh is corrupted.

366
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,020
 Let me say that again.

367
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,660
 We live in a fallen world that is run

368
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,100
 and that is inhabited by a deceiver

369
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,660
 underneath God's sovereignty.

370
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,660
 God gave Satan the ability to be present on earth,

371
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,100
 but he gave us the ability to have dominion over the earth.

372
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,220
 He is the prince of this world,

373
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,780
 but we serve the king of all creation.

374
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,420
 And so as servants of that king,

375
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,020
 we don't have to listen to some little local prince.

376
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,180
 He says, if you do, then you will live on this world

377
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,460
 that I wanted you to be a vice-regent on, a son of the king,

378
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,080
 you will live in bondage to him,

379
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,740
 and it will not go well with you.

380
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,940
 So don't buy his lies.

381
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,180
 We've bought his lies,

382
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,580
 and we have handed down one generation to another

383
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,280
 a corrupt soul, a sin nature.

384
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,420
 Now watch this.

385
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,380
 In this world inhabited by a deceiver,

386
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,620
 with our corrupt flesh,

387
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,100
 which we inherited from our father and mother,

388
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,740
 and we have well-established for the next generation

389
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
 to inherit from us,

390
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,580
 in a world that is broken and runs according to this prince

391
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,620
 and rebels against God,

392
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,780
 we are told, hey, you're going to be tempted.

393
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,460
 Now this is James writing to the church,

394
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,420
 so check this out.

395
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,260
 He says this in James 1:13,

396
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,580
 let no one say when he is tempted,

397
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,840
 I am being tempted by God,

398
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,120
 for God himself cannot be tempted by evil.

399
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,180
 And he himself doesn't tempt anyone.

400
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
 God doesn't tempt anyone.

401
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,100
 But each one is tempted when the scripture says

402
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,100
 he is carried away and is enticed by his own fallen nature,

403
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,940
 his own desire to find life apart from God,

404
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,060
 his own desire to bestow animation,

405
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,580
 to give life where life was not spoken to exist by God.

406
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,380
 And when we, in our arrogance and belief

407
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
 that we don't need God,

408
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,060
 we can do it on our own,

409
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,360
 when we go over here and we're carried away by that lust

410
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,040
 to have what we want our way and our time,

411
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,380
 it always brings forth death,

412
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,060
 just like Victor Frankenstein's invention.

413
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,680
 It says right here, do not be deceived,

414
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,600
 my beloved brethren.

415
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,440
 What do you see right here?

416
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
 Watch, this is really important.

417
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
 Let me walk you through very carefully what it says.

418
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,600
 It tells you here, be careful, okay,

419
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,520
 when you're being tempted and enticed by your own lust.

420
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,800
 Notice it doesn't say when you're being enticed by,

421
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,420
 and this is key,

422
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,140
 there's no surprise about what's coming

423
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,980
 or who it's coming from.

424
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,940
 It doesn't say when you are tempted by the demon of lust.

425
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,440
 It says when you're tempted by your own fallen nature,

426
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,980
 temptation and evil is monolithic.

427
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,040
 You're like, oh man, that's awesome,

428
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
 that's a great, write that down.

429
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,140
 What's monolithic mean?

430
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,260
 All right, let me tell you.

431
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,900
 This is what monolithic mean.

432
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,780
 When something is monolithic, it means it is one.

433
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,540
 It is one stone, one piece,

434
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,900
 there is no division in it, okay?

435
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,140
 There is never any differentiation

436
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,340
 or distinction in the scripture

437
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,200
 about what we're doing battle against,

438
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,900
 whether it's the prince of darkness,

439
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,080
 the adversary, the liar, the deceiver,

440
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,860
 the world that has been deceived by him

441
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
 or the flesh that has been corrupted by him.

442
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,140
 This is huge.

443
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,540
 James is telling you, this is your problem.

444
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,880
 When you're tempted and you're carried away,

445
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,260
 James says, by your own lust.

446
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,300
 He could have said by the prince of deception.

447
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,280
 He could have said by the course of the ways of the world.

448
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,120
 Why?

449
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,340
 Because Paul later wrote to you,

450
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,580
 and he says this in Ephesians chapter two, verse one.

451
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,500
 He says, listen, this is what you used to be

452
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,420
 before you were a Christian that James wrote to.

453
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,020
 He said, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.

454
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,260
 Now watch, in which you formerly walked according to,

455
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,080
 watch these three things,

456
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,260
 the course of this world,

457
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,140
 according to the prince of the power of the air,

458
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,980
 according to the spirit that is now working

459
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,700
 in the sons of disobedient.

460
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,780
 All three of those things, it's the monolithic,

461
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,820
 it's, if you will, called the trinity of evil,

462
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,740
 the axis of evil.

463
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,740
 What Italy and Japan and Germany were during World War II,

464
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,380
 that's what the world, the course,

465
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,140
 the current of this world, lower Greenville, all right?

466
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,340
 Stick that in your Houston context, all right,

467
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,700
 or your Fort Worth context.

468
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,980
 You know, just that life is found apart from God,

469
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,020
 life, if it feels right, do it.

470
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,460
 The course of this world, what your flesh thinks

471
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,500
 and what the enemy sells.

472
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,380
 There is never a distinction, this is huge.

473
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,740
 There's never a differentiation or distinction

474
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,060
 in doing battle against any of those three.

475
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,620
 This is gonna matter big time

476
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,140
 when you think about how to go to war against it.

477
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,420
 'Cause you can't cast out your flesh.

478
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,660
 You're not gonna be somebody that says,

479
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,900
 I rebuke the whole world, and the world goes,

480
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,300
 oh, you're right, we'll no longer have a Macy's Day parade

481
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,260
 that celebrates sin.

482
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,820
 No, that's what the world does all the time.

483
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,820
 It's always parading towards this life against God.

484
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
 The enemy's always going to lie,

485
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
 and he's always going to be roaming about

486
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,700
 seeking someone to devour, and catch this,

487
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,980
 your flesh is always going to want what it wants.

488
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,540
 Don't be surprised that even after you know

489
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,140
 that God is good and he loves you and he's died for you,

490
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,260
 that your flesh still wants to sin.

491
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,940
 When it says in the scripture, if any man is in Christ,

492
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,940
 therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.

493
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,980
 Behold, old things are gone, new things have come.

494
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,460
 I gotta tell you, I can remember when I trusted Christ,

495
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,540
 I couldn't believe that I still found myself

496
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,860
 lusting in my flesh.

497
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,260
 I couldn't believe I still found myself

498
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,800
 wanting to spike in anger in my flesh.

499
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,180
 I couldn't believe I was still attracted

500
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,700
 to all the things that I was attracted to before.

501
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,500
 And I go, I thought I was supposed to be a new creature.

502
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,660
 I thought I was never gonna wanna be, you know,

503
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,300
 prideful or self-absorbed again.

504
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,780
 I thought I was never gonna wanna objectify women again.

505
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,260
 I thought I was never gonna be a slave to pornography again.

506
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,340
 And I meant to, I prayed to receive Christ

507
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,540
 five or six times in the first 48 hours.

508
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,880
 'Cause it must not have taken.

509
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,100
 Because the old wasn't gone.

510
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
 Yes, it was.

511
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,900
 Here's the thing, let me explain that verse to you.

512
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,500
 What had changed was my understanding about God.

513
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,740
 Before I saw the beauty of God and his kindness towards me,

514
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,460
 that he wasn't mad, that he wasn't looking for me

515
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,260
 to build a resume and do my own works

516
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,540
 and become good enough, long enough

517
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,560
 that God would maybe one day accept me.

518
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,300
 I saw God as a policeman that was there

519
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,700
 waiting to blow his whistle and, you know,

520
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,660
 knock me over the head with his little, you know, baton.

521
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,340
 Or a principal or a teacher that was gonna go,

522
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,500
 "Hey, caught you, go down to that office."

523
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,420
 Or a referee that was gonna throw a flag on me.

524
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,160
 Or some high standard I could never meet.

525
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,900
 And so I really didn't want a relationship with God.

526
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,740
 I just didn't wanna be busted by him.

527
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,180
 And then all of a sudden I saw the beauty of God.

528
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,740
 I saw that he loves guys like me.

529
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,580
 He wanted to rescue me, not give me a bunch of rules.

530
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,620
 The rules were there to show me

531
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,900
 what his holiness looked like.

532
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,420
 And to show me that I wasn't that guy.

533
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
 And so I would cry out for mercy.

534
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,180
 And when I asked for mercy, because he's a loving God,

535
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,220
 slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and compassion,

536
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,540
 he would give me that mercy.

537
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,420
 And all of a sudden I go, "That's who God is.

538
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,260
 "And he's not mad at me.

539
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,380
 "He wants to reparent me and retrain me.

540
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,240
 "He wants to give me the freedom to not listen to my flesh

541
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,660
 "or the deceiver that has corrupted my flesh

542
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,700
 "or the world that is identified

543
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,460
 "by a bunch of fleshes like I had."

544
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,620
 What had changed was my understanding of God.

545
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,660
 And I no longer thought the spirit of this age

546
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,620
 was the spirit to follow.

547
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,700
 The spirit of my flesh was the spirit to follow.

548
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,300
 I now was no longer in a bondage to an unholy spirit.

549
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,040
 I knew the truth about the Holy Spirit.

550
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,940
 And so I would listen to him.

551
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,300
 And prior to that, I never would listen to him.

552
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,640
 So let me just start by just making it very clear right here

553
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,940
 that there is no secret about what is coming

554
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,060
 or who it's coming from.

555
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,540
 What is coming is a lie.

556
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,980
 It's not a power encounter.

557
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,400
 It's not a demon of lust.

558
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,820
 It's just lust.

559
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,020
 Humans thinking that on their own,

560
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,420
 they can create animation in a lifeless matter.

561
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,940
 I can make sex something that God never intended to be,

562
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,000
 and it can still be life-giving.

563
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,040
 See, God loves sex.

564
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,120
 God loves even drugs.

565
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,960
 You know that?

566
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,120
 Everything is lawful and everything is good

567
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,760
 when it's sanctified by the word of God in prayer,

568
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
 the scripture says.

569
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,680
 This idea that sex is bad, don't mess with it,

570
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,480
 drugs are bad, no, drugs are a gift.

571
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,720
 Ask my wife, who's delivered six children, okay?

572
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,360
 That little epidural, I mean, you know,

573
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,660
 she'd take her wedding ring off

574
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,480
 and put it right around that needle if she could.

575
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,440
 Like, I love you, come here, all right?

576
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,680
 So when you use drugs correctly,

577
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,240
 not to pull you out of reality,

578
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,260
 but when you use drugs directly to help the sick

579
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,460
 and the hurting and to minimize the pain

580
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,320
 so we can excise that which is evil in your body

581
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,040
 and killing you, okay, it works.

582
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,700
 It's sanctified by the word of God in prayer.

583
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,980
 God's given us all these things.

584
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,240
 You guys know that all drugs

585
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,040
 are basically derivative of plants,

586
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,480
 that he's given us the knowledge to understand

587
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
 how to break down, how to use.

588
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,260
 But some of us use those plants to escape reality,

589
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,180
 not be victorious in it.

590
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,640
 Is that glorious at all?

591
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
 You go, man, life's too hard for me.

592
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,660
 I just smoke some weed and chill.

593
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,240
 Well, that leaves the women and children

594
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,200
 in an awesome place, way to go, man.

595
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,560
 Just tap out, just go take a trip

596
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,540
 while the rest of the world lives in sadness.

597
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,740
 And by the way, all you become

598
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,760
 is a bigger burden in the world.

599
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
 And God's just saying, I can teach you to be a man

600
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,980
 and go to war against the world,

601
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,160
 but you gotta be sober, think clearly.

602
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,400
 Number one, there is no secret, right?

603
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,880
 There is no secret about what's coming

604
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
 or who it's coming from.

605
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,080
 Number two, are you ready?

606
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,960
 I hate that I'm a white American male

607
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,360
 who only gets to teach for 40 minutes.

608
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
 I need to go to Africa where they teach half a day,

609
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
 eat lunch, and come back and finish the message.

610
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
 That's where I wanna go.

611
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,300
 All right, here we go.

612
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,280
 But the floodwaters are rising in Houston,

613
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,680
 so we must hurry, here we go.

614
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,140
 There is no shame, okay?

615
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,580
 Number two, there is no shame or sin in being tempted.

616
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,560
 There is no shame or sin in being tempted.

617
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,000
 It's a lie, okay?

618
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,940
 Let me just show you something that's amazing, right?

619
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,840
 We are saved because we have a sinless Savior

620
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,240
 who went to a cross for us,

621
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,380
 and God made him who knew no sin

622
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,680
 to become sin on our behalf

623
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,780
 that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

624
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,080
 Though he was rich, he became poor,

625
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,580
 so that in his poverty we might become rich.

626
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,800
 Why do I share those verses?

627
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,480
 Because that guy who was sinless,

628
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,340
 who was rich in perfection, was tempted.

629
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
 What's that tell you?

630
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,260
 Temptation is not sin.

631
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,380
 Luke chapter four talks about Jesus.

632
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,220
 Watch this.

633
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,060
 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit.

634
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,120
 Listen, I would love if everybody started saying,

635
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,340
 Todd the other day, full of the Holy Spirit.

636
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,040
 I don't really care what comes after that.

637
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
 All right?

638
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,240
 I would love that to be the case.

639
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,960
 It was always the case with Jesus.

640
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,100
 He's the perfect man, not because of any other reason

641
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,880
 than he always yielded to the will of God,

642
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,980
 and he said no to lies, and he loved the truth.

643
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,560
 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan

644
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,660
 and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness

645
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,240
 for 40 days, being tempted by the devil.

646
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,480
 One of the things that really just concerns me

647
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,200
 and scares me is the way certain people think

648
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,640
 if they're really spiritual, they wouldn't be tempted.

649
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,500
 And I wanna let you know that that is not the mark,

650
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,120
 okay, of a godly individual.

651
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,900
 If you don't admit, if you can't admit you are vulnerable,

652
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,820
 you're never going to seek protection and encouragement.

653
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,320
 One of the things that you have to do is acknowledge,

654
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,220
 listen, I'm seriously tempted by this.

655
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,160
 I tell my friends, look, you guys know enough

656
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,280
 Greek mythology to know about this concept

657
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,480
 called the Achilles heel.

658
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,440
 And what typically happens, you know, guys,

659
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,560
 as they start to get my age, and they go out

660
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,320
 and they run like they used to run

661
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,080
 without stretching and being careful,

662
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,080
 their body eventually gives in and their Achilles pops,

663
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,120
 and it's awful.

664
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,180
 It's a place of weakness in man.

665
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,400
 And if you don't tell other people,

666
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,080
 this is where I'm weak, this is where I'm getting attacked,

667
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
 this is where the enemy can take me out.

668
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
 If you don't tell others where that is,

669
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,600
 how can they encourage you and help you?

670
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
 This is what the scripture says.

671
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,100
 It says we should encourage one another day after day,

672
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,240
 as long as it's still called today,

673
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,040
 so that none of us would be hardened

674
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,340
 by the deceitfulness of sin.

675
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,280
 That's Hebrews chapter three, verse 13.

676
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,960
 And I would just encourage you with this.

677
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,920
 There is no shame.

678
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,560
 It is not sin to be tempted.

679
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,440
 Remember what it said back there in James chapter one?

680
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
 Each one is tempted when he's carried away

681
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,520
 by his own lust, and that lust then gives birth to sin.

682
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,460
 But the temptation itself is not the problem.

683
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,720
 It's that your flesh doesn't go lie, lie, right?

684
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,360
 Or actually, your flesh will never say lie.

685
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,240
 Your flesh will say, give me that, give me that,

686
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,680
 give me that, but you do not need to be conformed

687
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,320
 to the world, but be transformed

688
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,720
 by the renewing of your mind.

689
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,400
 That's what's new.

690
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,080
 God is good, his way is true.

691
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,440
 All his ways are peace.

692
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,720
 In his right hand is fullness of joy,

693
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,040
 in his left hand are pleasures forever.

694
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
 Why would I go there?

695
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,000
 I'm not gonna lean on my own understanding,

696
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,780
 but in all my ways, I'm going to acknowledge him,

697
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,600
 and he'll make my path straight.

698
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
 But there is nothing wrong with saying,

699
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,360
 look, man, I'm tempted by same-sex attraction.

700
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,300
 I'm tempted by fear of men.

701
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,960
 I'm tempted by pornography.

702
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,480
 I'm tempted to escape the world and smoke weed.

703
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,320
 I'm tempted to hit Adderall.

704
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,600
 I'm tempted to excessively diet.

705
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,560
 I'm tempted to believe that I'll be happy

706
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,960
 if I make life pleasant

707
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,760
 because I'm more comfortable than others 'cause I'm rich.

708
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,620
 There's nothing wrong with saying that.

709
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,320
 In fact, it's helpful so people can come around you

710
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,360
 and help you with truth.

711
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,720
 There is no sin in being tempted, number three.

712
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,480
 There is no such thing as a faithful man

713
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
 who surrenders to temptation.

714
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,320
 (congregation laughing)

715
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
 Proverbs says this.

716
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,800
 It says, "Many a man proclaims his loyalty,

717
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,520
 "but who can find a trustworthy man?"

718
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,960
 There is no such thing as a godly man or a faithful man

719
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,000
 or a godly woman or a faithful woman

720
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
 who surrenders to temptation.

721
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,040
 Now watch, this is important.

722
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,780
 Notice I did not say there is no such thing

723
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,020
 as a godly man who doesn't sin.

724
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:12,000
 And there is a significant difference

725
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,200
 between a godly man and a faithful man.

726
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 This is one of the issues that I am zealous for my friends

727
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,600
 with same-sex attraction to hear.

728
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,960
 Because for too long, for too long,

729
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,960
 guys who were communicating in positions like mine,

730
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,880
 acted like the temptation towards the same sex

731
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,120
 was an offense to God, and until you could no longer be

732
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,160
 tempted towards men, you would never be a godly person.

733
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,620
 Can I just tell you something?

734
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
 As long as you can remember,

735
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,240
 that's what your flesh was drawn to, guy or girl.

736
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 And when you trust Christ, I'm not here to tell you

737
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,160
 that all of a sudden you're no longer going to have

738
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,140
 same-sex attraction in the same way that just because

739
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,280
 I've walked with Jesus for 30 years and had a ring

740
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,640
 in my hand for 26, 27 years,

741
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,540
 that I'm not attracted to other women.

742
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,040
 But what happens is I don't surrender to that

743
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,700
 which seems right to me.

744
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,440
 I don't lean on my own understanding.

745
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,980
 But in all my ways, I acknowledge him

746
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,040
 and he'll make my paths straight.

747
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,800
 But for me to have to act like I'm no longer

748
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,520
 sordidly tempted or seriously tempted by something else

749
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,440
 is crazy, and for somebody else to say,

750
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,200
 I'm just gonna surrender to that and Jesus is okay with that

751
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
 I'm gonna go, no, no.

752
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,680
 What fellowship does darkness have with light?

753
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,820
 How can you say I'm going to do what God said is unholy

754
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,720
 and the Holy Spirit is okay with that?

755
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,700
 But it is crazy, okay?

756
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,860
 I mean, listen, I'm gonna just drop a couple of these

757
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,460
 in here, you know, I do something every now and then

758
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,060
 to kind of give stuff to you in a shorter way

759
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,860
 since sometimes my first point lasts 18 minutes.

760
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,620
 I sometimes, I do stuff called Real Truth Real Quick

761
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,540
 and I did one on gay reparative therapy

762
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,840
 or conversion therapy.

763
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,100
 And what's a biblical view of that?

764
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,340
 And I want you to go listen to it.

765
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,140
 I want you to be informed about what your gay friends

766
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,020
 are going through and they're not gay

767
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,100
 if they're followers of Christ,

768
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,380
 they're sinners who struggle with same sex attraction.

769
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,460
 They're not gay.

770
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,580
 In the same way I'm not a lech and an adulterer.

771
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,020
 I'm tempted towards that.

772
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
 That's not who I am.

773
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,360
 We don't ever identify ourself by our sexual desires,

774
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,720
 sexual accomplishments or sexual escapades.

775
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,420
 We identify ourself by the love of God.

776
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,100
 And we acknowledge that our flesh may still go

777
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,420
 a certain direction.

778
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,780
 Let me say this to you, number three,

779
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,920
 this is very important.

780
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,780
 There's no such thing as a faithful man,

781
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,900
 a person who's serious about following God

782
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,420
 who surrenders to that which is contrary

783
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,380
 to the word of God.

784
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,160
 A lie.

785
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:52,500
 Fourthly, there is no saint who is beyond

786
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,160
 falling or screwing up.

787
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,380
 I have a gentleman that I had the privilege

788
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,980
 of meeting one time, his name's Michael Cromartie.

789
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,820
 He just died.

790
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,420
 He was a godly man who lived in D.C.

791
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
 and he worked in the corridors of power

792
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,220
 and was a great blessing to our nation.

793
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,940
 No one really even knew Michael Cromartie

794
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,420
 but he was an amazing man.

795
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,900
 And one of the things I heard him say one time

796
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
 that I frankly, you know, I'm asked a lot

797
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,220
 when people ask me about men that fall,

798
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
 they say things like, "Todd, are you shocked by that?"

799
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,580
 And Cromartie said this and I've used it like it's mine.

800
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,140
 And I said this, "I'm never surprised by weakness or sin.

801
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,740
 "I'm just not."

802
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,700
 You know what I'm surprised by?

803
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,940
 I'm surprised by virtue.

804
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,220
 I'm surprised by godly character

805
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,980
 because I just, in this world that is run by a liar,

806
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,540
 where every piece of flesh in it

807
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,300
 is longing to rebel against God

808
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,400
 and the course of this world

809
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,440
 is to draw our flesh away from God,

810
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,260
 I'm always surprised when I see people

811
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,460
 by the grace of God and the power of God,

812
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,540
 through the knowledge of God and the grace that works in men,

813
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,160
 see people resist sin and live holy, virtuous lives.

814
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,520
 Can I tell you guys something?

815
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,820
 I run scared, man.

816
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,520
 I am so aware of the fact that I could be next.

817
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,780
 I'm so aware that I could do things

818
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,300
 that would dishonor my God,

819
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,100
 that would be a death to my bride,

820
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,720
 that would kill my closest friends,

821
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,400
 that would grieve my father,

822
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,560
 and that would terrorize my community,

823
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,460
 that I pay attention to the word of God.

824
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,740
 I meditate on it day and night

825
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,100
 so I might be careful to do according to all that is written

826
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,680
 and let me just say this, man, be afraid, be very afraid.

827
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,280
 Billy Graham, that we all love

828
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,820
 and is soon coming to the end of his life,

829
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,500
 we love Billy Graham because he's one of the few guys

830
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,660
 that we think wasn't corrupted

831
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,480
 in the way that so many other guys are corrupted

832
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,780
 when they become celebrated as spiritual men.

833
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,300
 Billy Graham was always a guy that said,

834
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,340
 "Man, Billy, what's the secret to you being successful

835
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,260
 "in your walk with Christ?"

836
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,700
 He says, "I run scared."

837
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,420
 Another way to say it is I'm on the alert.

838
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,140
 I'm sober-minded because I've got an adversary, the devil,

839
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
 who roams around seeking someone to devour

840
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,120
 and I don't think because I've preached

841
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,400
 to massive amounts of folks

842
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,720
 and been in stadiums all around the world

843
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,080
 that I am not capable of messing up.

844
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
 I know exactly who it is.

845
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,320
 Guys who blow it in ministry,

846
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,400
 always, you can almost track it,

847
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,440
 they're guys who become lazy

848
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,120
 in their personal relationship with God.

849
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,680
 They become focused on doing spiritual things

850
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,660
 but not in being a spiritual person.

851
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,360
 In devoting themselves daily and meditating on God's word

852
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,080
 and being alone, away from crowds,

853
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,680
 away from human celebration,

854
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,320
 they also have a tendency

855
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
 because they become a man of renown

856
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,160
 and folks wanna spend time with them,

857
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,500
 they spend time with people who are fans

858
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,120
 as opposed to brothers who rebuke and encourage them

859
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,400
 and challenge them and also,

860
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,260
 they're often approached by members of the opposite sex

861
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,560
 and maybe out of a desire to be compassionate towards them,

862
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,640
 they spend time with them and alone with them

863
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,220
 and boom, trouble comes.

864
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,000
 And you see it, man,

865
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,240
 they grow lazy in your personal relationship,

866
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
 they begin counseling, spending time in isolation

867
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,640
 with individuals of the opposite sex

868
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,840
 or if they're same sex attracted with men of the same sex

869
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,660
 and they say, you know,

870
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,720
 I just didn't think it would happen to me.

871
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,360
 Can I just tell you guys something?

872
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,520
 I will not be surprised if it happens to me

873
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,380
 if I ever become lazy in my spiritual disciplines,

874
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,360
 if I ever start to spend time alone

875
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,960
 counseling a woman out of compassion

876
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,440
 and if I ever think it won't happen to me.

877
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,560
 You can almost bet it will.

878
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,880
 But I will to not sin.

879
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,080
 You won't hear me say I will not sin.

880
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,320
 And man, some of you guys come up and go,

881
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,360
 man, Wagner, I pray for you

882
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,260
 and I just go, well, that explains it.

883
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,080
 Thank you.

884
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,360
 There but by the grace of God go I.

885
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,180
 I'm telling you something,

886
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,280
 one of the hardest things I've gotta do

887
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,080
 is convince you that I've gotta go to war

888
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,640
 to make my marriage a blessing.

889
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,960
 I've gotta go to war so that I'm not an idiot

890
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,040
 and a tyrant as a daddy.

891
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,640
 I've gotta go to war so I'm not swayed

892
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,600
 by public adoration and by the praise of men.

893
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,360
 I've gotta go to war or I am next.

894
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,260
 God is opposed to the proud

895
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,520
 but gives grace to the humble.

896
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,880
 A prudent man, the scripture says,

897
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,040
 sees evil and hides himself.

898
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,860
 Let me just say one thing.

899
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,560
 The glory of young men is their strength

900
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,480
 but in Proverbs 20, 29, it says,

901
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,400
 the honor of old men is their gray hair.

902
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,640
 In other words, they live around for a while

903
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,900
 and young men always think, I got this,

904
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,700
 I can take this on, I got it, man, here I go, watch me.

905
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,320
 And that's not good.

906
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,980
 Look, I tell guys all the time,

907
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,240
 if you are a wildebeest and you're hanging out with lions,

908
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,360
 you're not courageous, you're next.

909
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,460
 That's just the way it's gonna go, okay?

910
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,340
 And so if you sleep with the dogs,

911
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,780
 you're gonna wake up with fleas.

912
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,400
 Bad company corrupts good morals.

913
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,920
 You mess around, you're in trouble.

914
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,560
 Let me just tell you guys something.

915
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,800
 It is a fact.

916
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,280
 A discretion is the better part of valor.

917
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,440
 That's what the scripture says.

918
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,480
 The prudent see evil and they hide themselves

919
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,200
 but the naive go on and they are punished for it.

920
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,020
 Yeah, they don't play with snakes, all right?

921
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
 So this is one of those moments, don't try this at home.

922
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,120
 That was when I was in India and I was,

923
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,460
 I should've been bitten right there in the face

924
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,000
 by that cobra and I wasn't.

925
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,480
 So they threw that up there just to go,

926
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,960
 okay, Wagner, practice what you preach.

927
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,440
 That was not my best moment.

928
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,500
 I predict if I do that again,

929
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,960
 I will have fang marks right here.

930
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,860
 Okay, here we go.

931
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,640
 But we hypnotized him and charmed him, right?

932
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,680
 Yeah, okay, all right, not my best moment.

933
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,800
 All right, thank you, here we go.

934
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,760
 There are no special cases.

935
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
 That's number five.

936
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,360
 There are no special cases.

937
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,320
 One of the things that I hear a lot from individuals

938
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,760
 is that they go, man, you don't understand my pain.

939
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,680
 I sometimes, the people come up and go,

940
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,560
 hey man, can I talk to you?

941
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,400
 I go, sure, what do you got?

942
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,920
 Well, come here, I need to talk to you alone, man.

943
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,540
 I mean, come over here, just over here.

944
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,380
 Well, why?

945
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,000
 Because I don't know if you can handle this,

946
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,240
 or I don't know if you've never heard

947
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,540
 anything like this before.

948
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,160
 Can I just tell you something?

949
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,220
 You are unique.

950
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,260
 I mean, you are unique.

951
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,920
 You have your own temptation,

952
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
 you've got your own family history,

953
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,800
 you've got your own family of origin,

954
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,360
 you've got your own sin struggles that are intense.

955
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,860
 You are unique, just like everybody else.

956
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:22,420
 And this is what my Bible says, and it's true.

957
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,240
 First Corinthians chapter 10, verse 13.

958
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,960
 No temptation has overtaken you,

959
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,360
 but such as is common to man.

960
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,820
 One of the ways you're gonna get in trouble

961
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,860
 is if you believe that you're a special case,

962
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,520
 that you're a same-sex attraction,

963
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,480
 that you're addiction to pornography,

964
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,120
 that you're excessive dieting,

965
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,000
 that you're bulimia, that you're addiction to men,

966
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,940
 that the abuse that you suffered from as a child

967
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,640
 is so unique that somehow

968
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,980
 there's some special parentheses of grace

969
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,440
 that you can do whatever you're gonna do

970
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,160
 and surrender to it and God understands.

971
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,000
 Can I just tell you this?

972
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,300
 First Corinthians 10, 13.

973
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
 No temptation has overtaken you,

974
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,440
 but such as is common to man.

975
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,600
 Everybody feels what you feel.

976
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,520
 And God is faithful, and he will not allow you

977
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,880
 to be tempted beyond what you are able,

978
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,360
 but with the temptation will provide the way of escape

979
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,820
 also so that you might be able to endure it.

980
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,380
 But you gotta want it, and you gotta go get it.

981
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,200
 Be strong in the Lord, the scripture says,

982
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,280
 in the strength of his might.

983
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,120
 The armor of God that we talked about last week

984
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
 is available to all of you.

985
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
 You've gotta put it on.

986
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,440
 There are no special cases.

987
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,720
 Number six.

988
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,280
 There's no silver bullet.

989
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,600
 Now this one's really important.

990
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,200
 All right, I told you that Frankenstein, Dracula,

991
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,320
 what's the third one in the Trinity in the axis of evil?

992
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,400
 Werewolves, all right?

993
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,960
 Werewolves, all right, Dracula by a wooden stake.

994
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,480
 Frankenstein by dying to that which you thought

995
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,980
 would give you life and repenting,

996
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,040
 because that was Victor Frankenstein's last words,

997
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,360
 kill the beast that I have created.

998
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,820
 It is ruinous to humankind.

999
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,220
 The enlightenment of man always is.

1000
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,440
 The wooden stake is what kills the bloodlust.

1001
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,700
 And what was that which took out a werewolf?

1002
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,540
 Silver bullet.

1003
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,840
 There is no silver bullet.

1004
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,640
 One of the things that I hear way too often

1005
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,820
 is that folks will tell you that the way you do

1006
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,020
 spiritual warfare is you do what is called ex-ballo.

1007
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,500
 You cast out, so in Greek, okay, we get the word ballistics

1008
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,340
 from the word in Greek, ballo, B-A-L-L-O.

1009
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,660
 That's what the word ballistics means.

1010
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,220
 It means to throw.

1011
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,380
 When you pull a gun, ballistics is the study

1012
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,820
 and the science of what is thrown out of a barrel

1013
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,180
 and how far it will go based on the shape of the barrel,

1014
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,020
 the force, the amount of gunpowder that is in there,

1015
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,020
 and the shape of the bullet itself, the cartridge.

1016
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,580
 That's the study of ballistics, how far you throw it out.

1017
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,300
 There is an idea today that the way you go to war

1018
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,060
 against Satan is by casting him out, ex-ballo.

1019
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,500
 You throw him out and you will be set free.

1020
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,340
 No, you don't.

1021
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,240
 Remember, there is a monolithic enemy.

1022
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,260
 We sometimes say it is the deception of the enemy.

1023
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,380
 Sometimes it is our flesh, which is a slave to deception.

1024
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,540
 Sometimes it is the course of this world,

1025
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,220
 and there is no distinction or differentiation

1026
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,680
 about how we go to war against any one of them.

1027
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,580
 It's always trust and obey.

1028
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,980
 There is no other way to be happy in Jesus

1029
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,380
 but to trust and obey.

1030
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,180
 You wanna be victorious over sin?

1031
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,340
 Don't go to some crazy place that's gonna cast out demons

1032
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,100
 and people convulse.

1033
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,680
 There is no demon of lust to get rid of.

1034
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,300
 There is lust in your flesh.

1035
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,560
 Even if you get rid of the so-called demon of lust,

1036
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,460
 your flesh is still corrupt and fallen.

1037
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,300
 The Bible has no program to curb your flesh.

1038
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,660
 You are to die to it and let Christ live.

1039
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,980
 Therefore, Paul writes, I have been crucified with Christ.

1040
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,940
 In the life I now live in the flesh,

1041
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,860
 I live by faith in the Son of God,

1042
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,200
 who loved me and delivered himself up for me.

1043
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,680
 I must decrease, John the Baptist said,

1044
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,740
 but he must increase.

1045
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,540
 We are to yield to the Spirit.

1046
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,840
 We are to continue to be controlled by the Spirit.

1047
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,340
 And when I don't live according to my own understanding

1048
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,540
 or follow my flesh, I walk in the way that is straight.

1049
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,680
 There is no enemy that I am to cast out or bind

1050
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,260
 if you wanna know where Satan is bound.

1051
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,400
 Listen to a real truth real quick.

1052
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,620
 Can we bind Satan?

1053
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,840
 Or just know this, Satan will be bound

1054
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,320
 during the millennial reign of Christ in Revelation 20.

1055
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,380
 Before that, he is a roaring lion

1056
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,060
 seeking whom he may devour.

1057
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,740
 And if you think that you have killed him,

1058
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,680
 you are just setting yourself up.

1059
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,140
 And it's a problem.

1060
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,820
 So there is no silver bullet, okay?

1061
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,820
 Watch this, I'm gonna read you

1062
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,860
 from 2 Timothy 4, one through eight.

1063
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,740
 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God

1064
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,520
 and of Jesus Christ, who is the judge of living

1065
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,360
 and the dead, and by his appearing in his kingdom,

1066
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,120
 preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,

1067
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,660
 reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction.

1068
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,120
 For the time will come when men will not endure

1069
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,180
 sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled,

1070
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,320
 they will accumulate for themselves,

1071
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,400
 teach us in accordance with their own desire.

1072
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,100
 What's more attractive to you if I tell you,

1073
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,160
 come over here to this powerful ministry that I've got

1074
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,780
 where I will cast out demons from people

1075
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,760
 and set you free from the bondage of the enemy,

1076
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,520
 or hey, come over here with me

1077
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,800
 and discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.

1078
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,280
 Come to this one-time event and we will deliver you

1079
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,020
 from the demon of, boom, or come over here

1080
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,420
 and go to war with me and not entangle yourself

1081
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,500
 in the affairs of everyday life

1082
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,560
 in order that you might please the one

1083
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,400
 who has enlisted you as a soldier.

1084
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,560
 Die to yourself continually, day by day,

1085
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,080
 or hey, there's a big revival happening

1086
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,960
 and the power of God will be unknown

1087
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,620
 when we will once and forever bind Satan.

1088
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,480
 Which one of those two gets you fired up?

1089
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,380
 Man, give me the quick pill.

1090
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,360
 It just isn't in your Bible.

1091
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,680
 Nowhere from Romans to Revelation

1092
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,060
 do you ever see the church told to cast out a demon.

1093
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,680
 Well, Todd, what about what Jesus did?

1094
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,960
 Aren't we supposed to WWJD?

1095
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,520
 No, you're not, you're not Jesus.

1096
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,800
 It's not what would Jesus do 'cause you're not Jesus.

1097
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,760
 How about what would Jesus have me do?

1098
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
 All right, whatever that is, put that on your bracelet.

1099
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,000
 All right?

1100
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,880
 (congregation laughing)

1101
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,480
 And what Jesus would have you do is to walk with him

1102
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,640
 and to trust him

1103
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
 and to be sober-minded

1104
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,200
 and delight yourself in the law of the Lord.

1105
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,160
 Lastly, there's no sense in going at it alone.

1106
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,880
 In other words, you were not made to do this alone, okay?

1107
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,880
 My friend who is in the Navy SEALs,

1108
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,160
 the Navy SEALs have an expression

1109
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,280
 which is two is one and one is none.

1110
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,520
 We just don't go by ourself, right?

1111
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,160
 We all know Marcus Luttrell.

1112
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,000
 They made a movie about him.

1113
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,820
 What's the movie called?

1114
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,660
 "Lone Survivor."

1115
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,500
 Well, guess what?

1116
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
 Marcus didn't survive because he was alone.

1117
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,580
 Marcus survived because people cared for him.

1118
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,800
 Even a Navy SEAL.

1119
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,020
 The mightiest warriors, they had the wisdom to know

1120
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,060
 you don't go at this alone.

1121
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,740
 If any man separates himself, he seeks his own desire,

1122
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,220
 he quarrels against all sound wisdom.

1123
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,060
 Let me just tell you something, man.

1124
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,360
 If you're not a part of a church

1125
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,420
 underneath godly leadership,

1126
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,460
 who doesn't lord it over you but serves you

1127
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,180
 and cares for you and shepherds you

1128
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,980
 and puts you in accountable community

1129
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,220
 where they are gracious towards you

1130
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,780
 and patient towards you and reprove you

1131
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,180
 and exhort you with great patience and instruction.

1132
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,420
 If you love Jesus so much you don't need anybody else,

1133
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,840
 you don't love Jesus 'cause you're not listening.

1134
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,740
 If you're a serious follower of Christ

1135
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,460
 and you're not deeply connected with a body, okay,

1136
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,660
 you are seeking your own desire.

1137
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,860
 A wildebeest that gets pushed out from the herd,

1138
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,340
 it's the one that's eaten.

1139
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,900
 There's no sense in going at this alone.

1140
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,620
 It was not God's intention.

1141
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,980
 When you get a member of the body of Christ

1142
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,020
 and you take him away and put him over there,

1143
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,580
 he is dismembered, it is a grotesque picture.

1144
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,740
 When you get a sheep away from the shepherd

1145
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,260
 and the rest of the flock, he's called a meal.

1146
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,500
 That's what they call a sheep who's over there by himself.

1147
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,900
 Not a stud sheep.

1148
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:30,860
 There's no sense in going at it alone, man.

1149
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,500
 We're called to bear one another's burdens

1150
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,580
 and thus fulfill the law of Christ.

1151
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,220
 God loves you and he wants you to be a part of a family.

1152
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,060
 So come on, man, come on.

1153
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,420
 Let me just give you one eighth one

1154
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,360
 and I'll do this in a minute.

1155
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,200
 Are you ready?

1156
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,760
 Because if you're listening to me out there,

1157
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,940
 some of you guys as believers,

1158
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,620
 you've gotta get this stuff correct.

1159
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:51,620
 You've gotta see why you're called to daily seek the King

1160
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,060
 and to abide with him in community

1161
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,260
 and to get rid of this false theology that's out there

1162
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,940
 and start to learn what the Bible says.

1163
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,340
 That's how you go to war against the unseen

1164
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,060
 and how you live victorious in a way that people can see.

1165
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,060
 There's something different about you.

1166
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,700
 Who are you that you're not a slave

1167
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,020
 to the prince of this world like I am?

1168
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,500
 Answer, I'm a son of the King and I abide with him

1169
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,300
 and he lives and he lives in me.

1170
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,460
 I used to think he was bad

1171
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,100
 and I had to manage my relationship with him.

1172
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,140
 I used to run from him and avoid him

1173
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,060
 and suppress his word and unrighteousness,

1174
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,820
 but now I listen to him and he is kind and good

1175
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,340
 and all his ways are peace.

1176
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,260
 Preach that, porch.

1177
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,620
 Save the world around you.

1178
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,860
 Change your generation.

1179
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,860
 But some of you guys are out there and you go,

1180
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,560
 Todd, if you knew what I had done,

1181
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,580
 if you knew that I was a Percy Shelley

1182
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,300
 and that there's a string of women that have committed

1183
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,420
 suicide 'cause they ran into me,

1184
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,020
 if you knew I was a Mary Shelley who threw myself

1185
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,060
 at the Romantic poet one after another,

1186
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,420
 if you knew the children that I killed

1187
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,060
 because I ran with Percy Shelley,

1188
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,020
 you wouldn't be telling me that I could be

1189
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,020
 a child of the King.

1190
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,340
 And can I just give you one last truth?

1191
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,180
 Here it is.

1192
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,420
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone

1193
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,920
 that they are beyond the help.

1194
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,920
 And there is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1195
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,840
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1196
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,680
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1197
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,280
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1198
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,520
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1199
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,520
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1200
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,520
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1201
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,160
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1202
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,360
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1203
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,280
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1204
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1205
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1206
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1207
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1208
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1209
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1210
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1211
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1212
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1213
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1214
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1215
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1216
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1217
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1218
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1219
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1220
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1221
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1222
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1223
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1224
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1225
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,880
 There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone.

1226
