[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:29.220]   - Summer's here, baby.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.420]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.740]   Come on.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.360]   Here's what that means tonight.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.820]   That means that there are a bunch of young adults
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.260]   gathered downtown Dallas, as well as Fort Worth,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.300]   as well as Houston.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.940]   I think we may have a picture of the downtown.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.780]   Do you guys have that?
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.740]   I don't know if you guys got that or not.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.740]   If you do, throw it up.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.620]   If not, no worries.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.740]   We'll show you guys later.
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.860]   But anyways, bunch of young adults gathered at Gillies
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.780]   or the South Side Ballroom tonight.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.840]   I love summer.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.900]   You guys like summer?
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.740]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.820]   They would love summer.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.420]   I like to get outside.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.940]   I like to get by the lake, hang out with the family.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.100]   I love to grill, which reminds me,
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.540]   today I was reminded of this story that I was,
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.980]   a group of us, it was kind of a guy's weekend,
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.700]   and we were hanging at my buddy's lake house.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.620]   And it's kind of like a lake cabin, if you will.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.820]   And we were grilling.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.100]   So a bunch of dudes, we went to Central Market,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.620]   got the good steaks, the fat filet.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.960]   And my buddy who was grilling was pretty excited about it.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.900]   The rest of us got in the truck and we were driving around,
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420]   just kind of looking for animals and stuff.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.300]   And we came back excited to feast.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.140]   And as we get out of the car, we hear him yelling,
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.160]   which is not normal 'cause he's kind of like
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.620]   an excitable guy, you know,
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.940]   and I think he's just happy about the filets.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.280]   And as I walk around out back,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.740]   it is this scene that I will never forget, okay?
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.860]   He has set his entire deck ablaze.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.180]   I mean, bonfire that is moving toward his house.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.620]   Here's what happened, is as he was cooking these filets,
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.260]   he didn't realize that the lighter fluid
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.180]   was under the charcoal grill, like too close to the,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.740]   like just sitting under there,
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.780]   getting hot and getting hot and getting hot.
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.700]   And as he saw it kind of ballooning, kind of expanding,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.740]   he tried to grab it with some tongs and it just liquefied.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.620]   And so this like liquid fire ran all over his deck
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.660]   and started seeping in between the deck,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.060]   burning it from underneath,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.820]   which all that's underneath are these dry pine needles.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.300]   So it's like this perfect storm of a fire, right?
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.640]   And so this is going on.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.260]   So we kind of walk back, we see this fire,
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.520]   but then the comedy of errors ensue
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.800]   because what happens is he goes to get the water hose,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.180]   but it's one of those water hoses
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.600]   that kind of wraps up in this box, if you will,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.420]   that's kind of connected to this other little hose.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.520]   He picks up the box and it rips away from the wall.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.020]   And so he's left with this four foot water hose,
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.220]   15 foot from the bonfire as it's approaching his house.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.200]   And so he turns on the water full blast
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.660]   and he's trying to perfectly arch the stream.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.380]   And so this is what I walk up on.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.660]   He's like, "Help, help!"
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.940]   I'm like, "What do you want me to do?"
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.340]   And so a bunch of us, right, the rest of us guys,
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.100]   we don't know what to do, there's no water hose now.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.740]   And so we run inside and we just start filling up
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.980]   Dickie's cups with water.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.220]   Like one guy's just out there spitting on it.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.360]   You know, we got nothing, right?
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.980]   We're trying to put out this fire.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.540]   And so what we end up, you know,
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.540]   eventually like he kind of saturates the deck
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.940]   and it runs in between.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.760]   And to this day, he has this huge burnt mark.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.820]   He hadn't replaced the deck,
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.900]   just this huge burnt mark that we saw.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780]   But the next day we woke up
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.460]   and we're just kind of praising God that we're still alive
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.020]   and the house is still there.
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.260]   And we're talking about it, we're laughing about it now.
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.160]   And at least the rest of us were.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.860]   And I go in his cabinet to get a Coke
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.740]   and right there is a fire extinguisher.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.420]   I said, hey bro, you know you got
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940]   a fire extinguisher in here?
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.620]   And he goes, no.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.800]   And I go, yeah, look right here,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940]   like seven feet from the fire.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.460]   I'm like, it's right here.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.340]   He goes, oh man, I forgot I had that.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.660]   He's like, man, that would have been
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.600]   really useful yesterday, right?
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.380]   That would have been something
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.860]   that I wish I would have remembered yesterday.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.520]   And he said, it's something I hope I never had to use.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.240]   And as I think about us tonight,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.260]   I think that's how we view our faith.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.180]   Like we think, hey, I've trusted in Christ
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.140]   and so now I'm a Christian, which means I have a faith
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.700]   in the one true God, I hope I never have to use it.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.340]   And then what happens when we face the fires of this life
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.520]   is it's not the first thing we're reaching for
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.540]   because we haven't been using it in every day.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.940]   We forgot we had it, we might as well not.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.500]   Let me go one step further with you.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   What if you don't?
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.940]   Like if you have a faith that you don't use,
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.280]   do you really have a faith?
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.940]   If you have a faith that you don't live according to
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.220]   and make decisions around and it doesn't impact
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.080]   the direction of your life, what you do, where you go,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.200]   how you hang out, how you talk, everything about your life,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.160]   is it really a faith?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.000]   Or is it something, like maybe you view it as kind of
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.700]   fire insurance, if you will, a get out of hell free card
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.400]   or something that you kind of filed away that,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.520]   hey, one day, hopefully that will get me into heaven,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.320]   but I'm not gonna use it here.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.720]   And let me tell you something.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.420]   Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, America is full of
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   lukewarm Christianity and the Bible does not speak fondly
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.580]   of lukewarm Christians.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.740]   It's a weird time to live, 2016, where you can kind of
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.700]   be cool and kind of be a Christian at the same time.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.980]   You look backwards, that's never really been the case.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.340]   And looking backwards, Christians always stood out.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.220]   They always stood out against culture.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.060]   They always stood out by the way they loved.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.700]   They were not the cool kids.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.820]   And then all of a sudden, it's 2016,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.920]   and we've just kind of blended in.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.100]   And I'm asking the question, is a lukewarm Christian
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.060]   any sort of Christian?
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.240]   And that's something we have to wrestle with this evening.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.940]   And so we're in this series, BC,
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.560]   which just is the Old Testament.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.160]   It stands for before Christ.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   I'm sorry, BC, which is pre-2016,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.500]   pre-Jesus coming up on the scene.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.260]   And we're looking at these stories of the Old Testament.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.200]   And we're moving toward Christ and we're looking at people
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.080]   who have a faith that also point to Jesus.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   And so tonight I'm gonna be in Daniel chapter three,
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.740]   if you wanna turn there.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.660]   Daniel chapter three, and we're asking this question,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.360]   what does real faith look like?
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.120]   And so we're gonna look at the lives of three men,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.560]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   If you've heard this story,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.200]   if you had it read to you as a child,
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.600]   if you have heard it here before
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.280]   or have heard it taught before,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.720]   it's an incredible story, a historical account.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.640]   And as we move through it, we're gonna look at
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   how a real faith is counter-cultural,
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.000]   how a real faith is uncompromising,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   and how a real faith makes converts of our critics.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   And so I'll set this up.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.200]   There's this king, his name is Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.560]   historical account, history does not deny this man.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   Everybody, historians, any credible historian would say,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   Nebuchadnezzar was absolutely a king, he was a real king.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.960]   He's this narcissistic guy.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.160]   He's the king of the Babylonian empire.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.120]   He has conquered much of the known world.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.040]   He's moved into Jerusalem.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.160]   He's burned down the temple and he's taken captives.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.640]   But this guy is smart, okay?
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.280]   Like if you look at the Assyrian king, the Assyrian empire,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.040]   they were really great at skinning people alive.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.080]   They had perfected it.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.040]   If you look at the Persian empire,
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.480]   they were great at crucifying people.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   The Babylonian empire is great at brainwashing people
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.160]   and mixing them into their culture.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.400]   That's what they're really good at, so that's what he does.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.000]   As he moves into Jerusalem, he takes God's people
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.800]   and he takes some captive, but those who are royal
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.760]   or those who are in the upper class,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.120]   those people that everyone else looked up to,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.240]   he gives them jobs and he feeds them well.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.600]   And he bribes them with food and a great life.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.240]   He says, "Hey, come and work for me
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.000]   "and you can have a great life."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.360]   I liken this guy to President Snow,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.900]   if you've seen "The Hunger Games."
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.360]   That's kind of what I think of
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.720]   as I think of King Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.880]   And so he begins to brainwash his captives.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.920]   And one way that he does this
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.860]   is he just changes the world they know,
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.800]   starting with their names.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.080]   And so he takes these three men who were the upper class,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.520]   they were nobility, and he gives them,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.840]   he offers them a good life.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.440]   And he takes Hananiah, which means God is gracious,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.240]   and changes his name to Shadrach,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.120]   which means commander of the moon god.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.920]   He takes Mishael, which means who is like God,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.880]   and he changes his name to Meshach,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.040]   which means who is like the moon god.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.020]   He takes Azariah, which means God has helped,
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.700]   and he changes his name to Abednego,
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.640]   which means servant of the god Nebu.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.980]   And in Daniel 3, what he does to these 4,600 Jews
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.100]   who are mixed into the Babylonian empire
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.580]   is he builds this gold statue 90 feet tall.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.180]   That's as tall as an eight-story building.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.460]   If you've seen an eight-story building,
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.480]   90 feet tall, nine feet wide,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.060]   and he's going to offer,
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.740]   he's going to present it to the kingdom.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.780]   And so his people come forward, and he says,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.840]   "Hey, whenever you hear the music,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.440]   "guys, listen, whenever you hear the music,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.480]   "I want you to bow down and worship the statue.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.240]   "And by the way, if you don't, we're gonna cook you a lot.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.280]   "So just do it."
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.880]   And everybody's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.980]   You got it.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.520]   And that's where it picks up.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.300]   Verse eight, chapter three of Daniel, verse eight.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.900]   At this time, some astrologers came forward
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.940]   and denounced the Jews.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.100]   So there's these Babylonian astrologers.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.180]   They don't like the Jews.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.820]   And they said to King Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.780]   "May the king live forever.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.920]   "Your majesty has issued a decree
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.520]   "that everyone who hears the sound of the horn,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.100]   "flute, zither, lyre, heart, pipe,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.460]   "and all kinds of music must fall down
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.300]   "and worship the image of gold,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.280]   "and that whoever does not fall down in worship
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.680]   "will be thrown into the blazing furnace.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.160]   "But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.320]   "of the province of Babylon.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.280]   "You've given them great jobs, king.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.760]   "These guys, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.500]   "they pay no attention to you, your majesty.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.340]   "They neither serve your gods nor worship
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.960]   "the image of gold you have set up.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.440]   "Furious with rage now, Nebuchadnezzar summons
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.140]   "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.300]   "So these men were brought before the king.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.820]   "And Nebuchadnezzar said to them,"
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.620]   Is it true, guys?
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.760]   Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.260]   "that you do not serve my gods
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.520]   "or worship the image of gold I have set up?"
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.680]   Now listen, come on, guys, okay?
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.340]   Let's just kind of go through the exercise.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.060]   Whenever you hear the horn, the flute, the zither, lyre,
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.300]   the harp, the pipe, or all kinds of music,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.360]   if you're ready to fall down
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.300]   and worship the image I made, very good.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.180]   But if you do not worship it,
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.580]   you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.840]   Then what god will you have,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.920]   what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.200]   And so Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, these three men,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.700]   they stand in contrast to their culture.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.960]   They stand out.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.180]   They stand out because of what they are unwilling to do.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.600]   In the midst of 4,600 of their peers,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.940]   all of them face down on the ground,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.980]   these men standing upright saying,
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.640]   "We can't bow to a foreign god."
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.980]   Now how are we doing tonight?
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.180]   How are we doing it, going against the culture
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.340]   or going with the culture?
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.820]   You guys heard this song, "Panda"?
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.120]   Let me sing it for you if you haven't.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.220]   ♪ Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda ♪
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.700]   ♪ Panda, panda, panda ♪
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.620]   Anybody heard that?
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.080]   Like I tweeted out the other day,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.720]   like this is the stupidest song I've ever heard.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.020]   And so people started responding.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.860]   They were like, I was like,
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.100]   "How is this on the radio?"
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.060]   And they're like, "Well, it's a great beat, man.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.100]   "It's a great beat, fun to dance to."
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.940]   So I was like, "Cool, man."
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.500]   So I just Googled it.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.040]   Like I'm just like, "Hey, I wanna read the lyrics.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.140]   "I was gonna read them to you tonight."
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.980]   I can't.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.020]   I can't.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.860]   I would lose all credibility with you immediately.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.780]   I mean wicked, vile things.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.580]   Okay, let's go get coked out of our mind,
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.740]   then let's go sell coke,
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.060]   and then let's go abuse women for sport.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.380]   And if you're not in, you're a little girl.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.060]   That's as clean as I can make it.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.300]   But let's go, man.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.180]   Hey, hear the music, bow down.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.140]   If I'm like, move, you know.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.740]   Panda, it was a great beat.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.920]   How we doing, guys?
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.800]   How we doing is standing against the current of our culture.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.280]   My first point is real faith is counter-cultural.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.800]   Real faith is counter-cultural.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.960]   I don't know if you've ever heard to be in the world,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.360]   but not of the world.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.520]   It's usually said by someone who is of the world.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.920]   And I know Jesus said it, but here's the deal.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.960]   You're in the world, that part's taken care of.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.760]   You don't have to try to be in the world.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   You're in the world.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.440]   You can't not be in the world.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.760]   You're in the world, and you're called not to be
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.440]   of the world, to stand apart from the world.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.680]   And so as followers of the one true God,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.440]   our decision should cause us to stand out,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.360]   both what we choose to do and what we choose not to do.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.320]   And it seems to me that everybody's trying to stand out
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.360]   that no one stands out.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.240]   Like when I go to the mall today,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.520]   I'm just looking at every, like the,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.680]   the thugs and the preps and the hipsters,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.600]   and everybody just looks crazy.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.320]   And it's like, they all kind of mix in,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.760]   and everybody's trying not to be normal.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.880]   So everyone's normal.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.200]   It's like the cool thing is to rebel against culture
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.320]   so there are no rebels, except those that say,
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.480]   I won't do that.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.880]   I'm not in.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.240]   I don't need to be different to stand out.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.760]   I'm gonna embrace God.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.800]   I'm gonna embrace my own self.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.760]   I'm gonna embrace God.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   I'm gonna let this faith mark my life.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.800]   We stand out as Christ followers wherever we go.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.400]   It's like, it's like in,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.320]   in order, disorder stands out.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.000]   Like in morality, immorality stands out.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.800]   When you're in class and the teacher
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   is holding everyone's attention,
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   that one guy who keeps acting out, who keeps acting up,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.320]   he's disrupting the entire class,
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.960]   bringing attention to himself, he stands out.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.920]   But when everyone is acting out,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.960]   the one person who is sitting still,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.280]   doing what they should do, they stand out.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.400]   They're the rebel.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.240]   They're the counter-cultural one.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.800]   In immorality, morality stands out.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   In a world that rejects God,
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.320]   a person who fully embraces God stands out.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.920]   Not someone with a fire extinguisher in the closet,
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.760]   but someone who is using it on the daily.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.360]   Standing out, it's not always fun.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.080]   You face persecution.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.400]   Listen, you probably won't be burned alive.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.760]   Probably, I mean, that probably is not gonna,
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.560]   but persecute, you might spend Friday night alone.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   And for some of you, that's just as terrifying.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.520]   And I'm just here tonight to tell you, man,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.920]   it's gonna be okay if you're alone Friday night.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.200]   It's gonna be all right.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.720]   It seems to me that Christians today
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.040]   are the most unwilling to stand out
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.400]   by their choices than they've ever been.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.760]   We're scared of being identified as weird.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.440]   In fact, there's a group of sociologists
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.680]   that did a study in a book called
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.480]   "Premarital Sex in America."
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.720]   And they studied two groups of men,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.320]   unmarried, college-educated, ages 18 to 23.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.440]   All the men were unmarried, college-educated,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.640]   ages 18 to 23, but they classified them in two groups.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   The first groups were men who were raised in a family
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.480]   where they said it's completely okay
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.160]   to have sex outside of marriage.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.600]   It's completely okay to have premarital sex.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.000]   Like that was just the theology,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   the world that they were raised in.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.880]   And the second group of men were raised in a family,
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.640]   a Christian family, Judeo-Christian values
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.600]   that say sex outside of marriage is wrong.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.760]   And so of the first group of men who were raised
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   in a family where they said there is nothing wrong
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.200]   with sex outside of marriage, amongst that demographic,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   23% of them were virgins, only 23%.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.160]   But in group two, those that were raised
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   in the family that sex outside of marriage is wrong,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.840]   20% were virgin.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.640]   Less.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.240]   And here's what's going on,
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.720]   because they said, hey, we have a belief,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.440]   but our belief does not influence our behavior.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.760]   We have a theology, but we've been more influenced
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760]   by culture.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.720]   We're not counter-cultural,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.600]   we're more cultural than culture is.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.240]   My belief doesn't influence what I do.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.040]   No, I say I believe this, but I do what I want.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.440]   It's not a real belief.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   It's a fake belief.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   It's not a real belief.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.360]   They said they had convictions,
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.880]   but when things got hot, they went the way of culture.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.040]   And this is my story.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.280]   I was raised in the church.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.840]   I mean, I was like over-churched.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.560]   I mean, I went to a church school, church on Sunday,
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.880]   church on Wednesday, two churches on Sunday.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.120]   I went to Lutheran church, Catholic church,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.680]   First Baptist, Quero, Texas, teen time, every week, man.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.520]   They brought in the speaker
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.000]   to do the True Love Waits campaign.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.960]   I bought the ring, I got the certificate,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.280]   dug my heels in the sand.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.720]   I'm going to abstain from sex until I'm married.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.520]   God, I take the vow with all of these people.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.520]   There's no way I'm gonna do that.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.640]   Got in a relationship as a teenager,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.240]   a toxic relationship, crossed physical boundaries
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   that just got further and further and further in sex.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   And I remember going home that night it happened.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.600]   And I remember laying in my bed all by myself, weeping.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.160]   How did this happen?
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.880]   How did this happen?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.440]   How did I do this thing I promised I would never ever do?
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.640]   How did I compromise my convictions?
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.480]   And the only way I knew to cope was to do it again.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.560]   And then again and then again and then with her
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.880]   and then with her and then with,
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.040]   and then it just became sport.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.920]   It became the objective.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   So this thing that I was completely opposed to
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.680]   became the thing that I started aiming at.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.880]   I was washed up, man.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.600]   Completely compromised and it ended up
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.760]   being completely compromised and it happens with alcohol.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.960]   One mambo taxi turns into two.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:40.400]   Drugs, money, spending, the way you dress,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.000]   what you watch, what you listen to,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.040]   and what you do contradicts what you say,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.000]   you believe and it's just confusing.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.880]   'Cause who wants to be the only one at the party sober?
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.520]   Who wants to be the only one that wasn't invited
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.680]   to the party?
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.360]   Who wants to be the only one who doesn't see Deadpool
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.280]   or Neighbors 2 or who wants to be the only one
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.760]   at the lake in a one piece?
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.640]   Who wants to be that girl?
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.940]   Let me show you some guys.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.240]   Verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to him,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.520]   "King Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.420]   "before you in this matter.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.200]   "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.920]   "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.160]   "and he will deliver us from your majesty's hand."
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.000]   And listen, underline verse 18, focus on this,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.160]   pay attention.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.200]   But even if he does not,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.080]   but even if he does not,
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.860]   we want you to know, your majesty,
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.120]   that we will not serve your gods
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.600]   or worship the image of gold you have set up.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.080]   I'll tell you why that, but even if he does not,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.800]   is so important, because in our culture, in America,
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.160]   we kind of pride ourselves on making decisions
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.480]   and we call it critical thinking or problem solving
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.680]   and we're taught it in school.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.720]   And so what we do when we're faced with a decision
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.560]   is we begin to process the possible outcomes.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.000]   So we look at a decision and we say,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.680]   well, if I make that decision, that will happen.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.120]   If I make this decision, that will happen.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.200]   Now what's the right decision?
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.000]   But I'm telling you, you can't judge obedience
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.800]   by the outcome or the perceived outcome
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.440]   when God's word speaks to it.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.600]   And so that's not what these men,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   they didn't say, well, if we do that,
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   we're gonna be burned alive,
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.840]   but if we don't do that, we'll live,
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.520]   so we'll choose life.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.840]   They say, God's in charge of the outcome,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.360]   we're just going to obey and he will rescue us.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.680]   But even if he doesn't,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.320]   we're gonna be faithful,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   we're gonna hold to our convictions.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.360]   My second point this evening is a real faith
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.600]   is uncompromising.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.200]   A real faith doesn't compromise.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   See, the most creative person on the planet
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.960]   is someone seeking to justify their sin.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.320]   All right, in an opportunity to compromise,
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.240]   they begin saying things,
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600]   well, does the Bible really say that?
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.480]   And you know, I don't know, and what if I do this?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.760]   And they begin to think about
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.880]   all of the effective ministry that's gonna happen.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.280]   If they go to the bar, they have the drink,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.520]   or they wear the dress, or whatever it is
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.400]   that they're processing.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.800]   I know this dress doesn't cover my butt,
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.760]   but, and even though it's a little tight,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.040]   you know, it's still covering everything.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.640]   I know I shouldn't date him,
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.040]   but maybe it's a chance to share Jesus.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.520]   I know it's the club, but it's the birthday girl,
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.840]   that's where she wants to go,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.560]   and didn't Jesus hang out with sinners?
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.240]   It's my boy's bachelor party,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.120]   what am I not supposed to go?
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.320]   Like, I'm gonna be the one that doesn't go to the bach,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.360]   that's really what you think God, that's not,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.160]   I don't think that's what God wants.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   And you wanna be liked, so you compromise,
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.040]   'cause we're still, even after college,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.960]   trying to be popular, trying to be liked.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.360]   You're working out, looking good,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.600]   you got a new swimsuit, you wanna show it off.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.960]   You go to the lake, the music is playing.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.120]   I mean, of course you're gonna dance,
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.200]   you're not even drunk, right?
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.000]   People are taking pictures of you,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.840]   and now all of those pictures are getting liked.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.400]   It feels good to be liked.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.960]   So of course the bikini was a great idea.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.800]   Even though your faith is compromised.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.020]   Even though your witness was compromised.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.820]   Even though you confused your message.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.160]   It's worth it, right?
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.280]   It happens when we begin to think
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.760]   the Bible is an outdated idea.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.200]   Is that what it really means?
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.880]   Unless you risk being alone, man.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   You totally do.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:02.600]   I believe my God is going to give me a spouse.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.240]   But even if he doesn't, I ain't gonna wear that.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.200]   I believe my God is going to save
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.440]   this family member I've been praying for.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.740]   But even if he doesn't, I'm not gonna compromise.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:25.280]   I believe he's going to bring me some friends.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.880]   But even if he doesn't, I'm not going to the club, man.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.720]   Not up for that.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.080]   But even if he doesn't, and yes it will cost you,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.840]   and yes I have paid the price on occasion.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.380]   I have failed at this miserably.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.840]   Like sometimes I'm just convicted,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.240]   and I'm like, am I leading them astray?
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.920]   Am I trying to be the cool Christian at times?
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.720]   Am I standing out enough?
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.480]   I can remember on one particular occasion,
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.720]   I was in charge of planning the bachelor party,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.960]   and so I did everything I could.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.880]   I was a believer, I was walking with Christ,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.720]   and so I rented a tour bus.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.680]   That was my grand idea, and we stopped at one place
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.160]   as we were gonna go fishing,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.720]   and we stopped at one place where there was alcohol,
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.120]   and it was a restaurant and whatnot.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.240]   And we get out for an hour, we eat,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.040]   and as we get back on the bus,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.000]   all the guys, they've convinced some girls
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.640]   to come on the bus with us and to go fishing with us.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.720]   Some of them married.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.140]   And I stood at the door, and I'm like,
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.640]   not today, boys.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.840]   It's not gonna happen today.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.000]   It wasn't me, I mean the Holy Spirit strengthened
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.400]   my conviction in the moment, gave me courage in the moment,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.200]   and it cost me, I talked about it here,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.880]   and I mean it cost me relationships.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.180]   I mean guys said, hey, we're done, dude.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.480]   Taking your faith too far, man, we are so out.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.840]   We are so done with that.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.160]   But it's been amazing to watch as the years have passed by
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.880]   how God has gone back and grabbed the hearts
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.820]   of some of those men and made them real men
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.460]   and amazing husbands and amazing fathers.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.920]   And in ways I never, I didn't even have enough faith
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.160]   to believe that he would.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.720]   He's done incredible things.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.240]   And so you gotta say, hey, this is what I'm gonna do
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.000]   because it's right, and my God is gonna,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.400]   he's gonna help me, he's gonna protect me,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.900]   but even if he doesn't, I'm not gonna compromise.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.840]   I'm not gonna compromise what I know to be right.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.880]   And if you wanna compromise your convictions
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.840]   and you wanna walk through life
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.200]   with a weak, counterfeit faith,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.460]   you will have plenty of opportunities.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.700]   I mean, listen, we have, let's just kinda go
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.100]   through the gamut of what has happened on our watch, right?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.100]   We've redefined marriage, okay, boys.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.340]   Boys, like as you raise girls, okay, like I'm raising girls,
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.020]   as you raise girls, I'm talking to you now, okay,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.420]   boys are gonna be able to go to the bathroom with them.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.060]   That's going to happen, and that happened on our watch.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.820]   I know our grandparents' generation introduced divorce
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.900]   into the situation.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.380]   This is what we've introduced into the situation
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.420]   on our watch.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.980]   These are the things that we've done.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.420]   We're working to legalize marijuana
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.660]   and increasingly more and more as logic is applied
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.480]   to the issues, it is identified as hate speech,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.320]   which is crazy.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.140]   Like imagine this, you're trying to lovingly explain
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.300]   to someone that they are a boy because they have a penis
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.660]   and you're called a bigot.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:29.300]   And some of you here and listening
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.460]   take pride in the reality that this has happened
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.340]   on our watch, we call it civil rights.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.860]   And I say, what?
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.860]   Oh my, what a tremendous insult
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.820]   to the civil rights movement.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:49.140]   What a tremendous insult.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.860]   And don't you understand in civil rights,
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.060]   it was the people who were marching against the culture
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.900]   of that time.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.420]   Now it's everyone marching with the culture of that time,
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.060]   calling it good and right and true.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.260]   Now listen, listen, in case you're about to leave
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.180]   or you're frustrated or you disagree,
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.700]   I love my transgender friends.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.140]   I love my homosexual people
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.100]   who identify as homosexual friends.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.020]   What you need, a room, you got a room, stay at my house.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.740]   You need money, I got you.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.460]   Let me know, how can I serve you?
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.500]   How can I help you?
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.860]   But I'm not gonna further your confusion
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.500]   by caving into what culture teaches.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.260]   That's not helpful.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.840]   (congregation applauding)
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.980]   Praise God for some agreement.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.400]   But even if you didn't,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   I ain't gonna compromise.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.040]   I'm gonna lovingly teach the truth.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.280]   Like these men lovingly, do you see what they did?
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.120]   They winsomely said, "Your majesty."
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.600]   And it started in Daniel one, two chapters before this.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.440]   They're asked to eat some defiling food.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.700]   The king is offering them a feast and wine.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.160]   And we don't know why it would defile them.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.560]   Maybe it was sacrifice to idols.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.720]   Maybe it was unclean food.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.200]   But they're asked to eat it.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.840]   And they say, "We won't do that."
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.680]   But they don't say it like that.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.320]   They don't say, "Hey, we won't do that."
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.880]   They say, "Hey, can we suggest something else?"
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.160]   Like, what if you just feed us vegetables?
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.360]   And they say, "Well, if we just feed you vegetables,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.600]   "you're not going to be able to do the work that the king."
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.120]   No, what if you feed us vegetables
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.240]   and we work harder than everybody else
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.800]   and we do everything that you ask us to?
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.320]   Will you just give it a try?
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.000]   And they say, yeah, here's what they're saying.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.160]   They say, "Hey, let us prove our convictions
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.520]   "are right to you.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.480]   "Give us time and observe us.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.340]   "We don't have to hate you.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.260]   "We don't have to talk aggressively or with angst to you.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.160]   "We don't have to be mean to you.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.620]   "Can we just sit down and talk logically about this issue?
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.260]   "And will you give me some time
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.560]   "and see if I can win you over
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.880]   "in the way that I work diligent
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.760]   "and how I winsomely disagree?"
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   My friend Blake, the guy that caught his deck on fire,
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.080]   he didn't know where his fire extinguisher was,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.180]   but that brother knows where his faith is.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.120]   He uses it all the time.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.440]   I get to see him use it all the time.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.000]   And let me tell you something, he's a dad.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.360]   And when his son, his five-year-old,
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.520]   was hit with acute lymphoma leukemia,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.560]   a terminal sickness,
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.720]   that brother's on the ninth floor
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.280]   of Children's Medical Center,
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.640]   and he said, "Hey, you don't determine
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.480]   "if you have a faith."
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   I'm on the ninth floor of Children's Medical Center.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   When you watch your son getting poked and prodded
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.900]   and poisoned intentionally and screaming in pain and agony,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.760]   and you sit and you watch on this side of a glass,
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.640]   you don't decide then,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.520]   "Hey, do I really believe I can trust you, God?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.060]   "God, I trust that you're going to heal my son,
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.900]   "but even if you don't, I'm not gonna turn away from you.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.640]   "God, I trust you're gonna bring someone to me
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.940]   "to spend the rest of my life with,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.940]   "but if you don't, I'm not wagering that bet with you.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.320]   "I'll go to heaven with you
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.400]   "and indulge in all the glories of your presence
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.340]   "if it means being single the rest of my days.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.920]   "I trust you will give me a child one day,
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.340]   "but if you don't, I'm not gonna turn from you.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.980]   "I trust you will save my loved one,
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.780]   "but even if you don't, God,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.960]   "there's nothing that would turn my heart from you."
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.200]   Verse 19.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.180]   Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.820]   with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.220]   and his attitude toward them changed now,
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.900]   no longer bargaining, no longer wanting to talk.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.980]   He ordered that the furnace be heated
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.100]   seven times hotter than usual,
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.440]   and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.740]   to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.960]   and throw them into the blazing furnace.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.600]   So these men wearing their robes, their trousers,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.660]   their turbans, and other clothes
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.880]   were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.660]   It's going to great lengths to show you the detail
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.740]   that these men have a lot of flammable things on, okay?
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.540]   They're gonna be torched.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.900]   But the king's command was so urgent,
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.980]   it was so hasty, he's so angry,
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.940]   and the furnace was so hot that the flames of the fire
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.540]   killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.680]   and Abednego, and these three men firmly tied
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.780]   fell into the blazing furnace.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.460]   This is nonsense and rage is what's happening.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.120]   Because listen, if you wanna slowly,
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.420]   I mean, if you wanna torture somebody,
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.540]   if you're mad at them, you don't turn a furnace up,
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.860]   you turn it down.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.560]   You say, hey, cool down the fire, let them burn slow,
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.220]   I wanna hear their screams, I know that's sick,
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.100]   but that's what you would do, right?
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.060]   You wouldn't say, hey, turn it up seven times hotter
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.140]   so they're burned right away.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.980]   What's God doing here?
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.380]   God is using the rage of man to show you how powerful he is.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.660]   Stack the cards against me, I'm God, watch me flex.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.340]   That's what he said.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.960]   It's the new JP version.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.880]   It's what he said.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.960]   You want me to fight a giant?
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.400]   Give me a boy and some rocks.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.200]   I don't need a tank, man.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   He's God.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:20.560]   Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.200]   and asked his advisors, weren't there three men
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   that we tied up and threw into the fire?
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.120]   They replied, certainly, your majesty.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.400]   Man, just, okay, 'cause I like blew past it.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.240]   Can you imagine the angst and the heartache
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.520]   that you would feel on that day?
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.040]   Hey, guys, we were faithful, you're looking at your boys.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.560]   I also love the fact that they weren't alone,
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.800]   said you're gonna be left alone,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.360]   but these guys had community.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.060]   They were in it together, locked arms, let's go.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.080]   We're not gonna compromise our faith.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.560]   But they're looking at each other in the eyes,
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.720]   they're looking at the furnace, they feel the heat.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.320]   I'm like, man, here it is, man.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.000]   It's been real, let's go.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.800]   He says, wait a minute, what's going on?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.560]   There were three men that we threw in the fire.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.400]   I don't understand, he said, look,
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.840]   I see four men walking around in the fire now,
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.440]   unbound and unharmed, and the fourth one
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.280]   looks like a son of the gods.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.320]   That word gods there is Elohim.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.840]   It's where we get the, it's the word for the one true God,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.060]   the Yahweh, Jehovah, that we worship.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:28.440]   And in there is the son of that God protecting them.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.780]   He's in the fire with them.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.420]   And Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.780]   of the blazing furnace and shouted,
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.420]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.860]   servants of the most high God, come out, come here.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.100]   So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.140]   and the satraps, prefects, governor,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.340]   and royal advisors crowded around them.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.340]   And they saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.900]   nor was their hair, nor was a hair of their heads singed.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.500]   Their robes were not scorched,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.620]   and there was no smell of fire on them.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.980]   Then Nebuchadnezzar said,
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.540]   praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.080]   who has sent his angel, anytime you see his angel
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.960]   or the angel of the Lord,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.020]   it's a reference to the pre-incarnate Christ, Jesus,
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:15.420]   before he was born of Mary, 2,016 years ago.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.540]   He has sent his angel and rescued his servants.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.980]   They trusted in him and defied the king's command
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.740]   and were willing to give their lives
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.220]   rather than serve or worship any God except their own God.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.300]   "Therefore I decree that the people of any nation
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.180]   "or language who say anything against the God
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.300]   "of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be cut into pieces,
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.680]   "and their houses be turned into piles of rubble,
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.700]   "for no God can save in this way."
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.380]   And the three were promoted over the province of Babylon.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:50.020]   So this man who is completely crazy, he hates God,
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.680]   and he won't let anyone worship the one true God,
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.040]   now he turns, completely worships that God,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.700]   and says, "Hey, if you don't worship him,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.740]   "I'm gonna cut you into pieces and tear down your house,
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.880]   "and I ain't playing."
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.140]   He's crazy.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:10.500]   And Jesus shows up in the fire and protects them.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.820]   And it happened, it's not like a fairy tale,
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.160]   it's not like this thing like Disney made up.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   It's true, and so my third and final point
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.620]   is real faith converts critics.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.420]   Real faith converts critics.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:31.080]   See, when people see you faithfully living out your faith,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.000]   they take an interest in your faith.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.860]   It's weird, you're the only person there sober,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.820]   that's so weird, like why do you do that?
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.980]   It's intriguing to me, let's talk about it.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.480]   So you go to this thing every Tuesday,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.220]   like tell me more about that.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.060]   What are y'all, do you sing songs, is it like youth camp?
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.780]   Like what do you do there?
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.980]   Two guys named Shane, that's weird.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.560]   So tell me more about this Jesus,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.020]   so you think he's gonna take you through the grave
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.980]   into eternal life.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.060]   See, you won't have faith in the furnace
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   unless you have faith that Jesus
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.860]   endured a worse furnace for you.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.980]   That in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.060]   as he sweat blood facing the cross,
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.640]   that that was done for you.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.540]   That he died the death that you deserve
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.940]   and he did it for you so that you could be with him forever,
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.140]   not because of your works,
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.620]   but because you believe that he paid the price
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.460]   for you to enter God's kingdom
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.820]   through his death and his resurrection.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.820]   And you begin to live out that faith and it's weird.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.860]   I've seen it happen, I've got to run with you guys
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.920]   for about a decade now.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.260]   And every now and then there's someone that just stands out,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.140]   kind of like man, that guy or that girl, they get it.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.300]   And this one individual, before I ever met him,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.340]   I had heard of him.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.900]   'Cause I heard how he was a division one athlete,
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.740]   how he was a starter, a team lead.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.460]   And I heard how he continued to courageously
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.300]   live out his faith.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.660]   Before I ever met him,
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.580]   I heard how he chose not to laugh
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.420]   at the inappropriate jokes in the locker room.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.540]   How he tried, or he didn't try to fit in
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.660]   with the bad language that the other guys were saying,
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.280]   that he chose not to treat the other freshmen teammates
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.740]   poorly, to get a laugh from his coach or his teammates.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.420]   And I heard, I had heard specifically about how he was made
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.220]   fun of because of the decisions that he made
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.100]   and how he wasn't invited to the parties.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.420]   And as he was a strong, good looking young man
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.020]   with a lot of things going for him,
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.820]   he had been rejected by some of his classmates
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.660]   and some of his teammates.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.020]   And of course, as an athlete and a good looking guy
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.620]   and a starter and a team leader,
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.220]   some girls gave him a lot of attention,
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.080]   some girls that really matters to.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.720]   And so, they were willing to come up to him
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.160]   and swoon for him.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.400]   And he had made a commitment to treat them different.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.960]   In fact, he saw it as an opportunity
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.880]   to minister to his teammates
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.960]   in the way that he talked to them and spent time with them
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.800]   and the way that he was intentional about what he did
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.000]   and didn't do with those girls.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.800]   And on one particular occasion,
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.760]   and this was the story that I was like,
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.400]   "Man, I've got to meet this guy."
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.240]   His position coach, he played football,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   his position coach had come to his teammates and said,
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   "Hey, I want you to bring some violent images
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.540]   "and we're gonna put them on this wall
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.160]   "to kind of cast a vision for us to be tough
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.600]   "and violent and aggressive out there.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.200]   "You guys bring the most violent images you can."
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.000]   And so, his teammates began to bring crime scenes
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.520]   and pictures of mutilation and pictures of genocide
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.960]   and some of the most grotesque images that you can imagine.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.200]   He didn't do that.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   The coach pulled him aside as the players got excited
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.360]   about this little exercise, this homework, if you will.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.200]   And the coach said, "Hey, I need you to bring an image."
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.080]   And when his time went on and he didn't,
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.600]   the coach came to him again and said,
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.800]   "Hey, I'm serious about this assignment."
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.160]   And the third time that he was inquired
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.920]   about this assignment, he brought a picture and he says,
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.720]   "This is the most violent image I can think of, coach.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.520]   "It's a picture of Jesus Christ
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.760]   "being crucified on the cross.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.240]   "It's a scene from the Passion.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.360]   "And this is when all of my sins went on Him.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.520]   "And so, this is the most violent image I can imagine.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   "Let's put this on the wall."
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.760]   It's counter-cultural.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.840]   It's uncompromising.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.800]   And this coach that didn't like him very much said,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.560]   "Man, that's really convicting.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.680]   "Let's have a conversation."
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.040]   And my friend got to share the gospel with him
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   and got to walk him through how he can have
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.280]   a relationship with Christ.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.520]   Real faith converts critics.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.120]   It may not happen right away, but you stay strong.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   It's your ability to make it through the furnace
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.600]   will be in direct relation to the amount of faith
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.800]   you have that Jesus went through the furnace for you.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.720]   How you doing right now?
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.800]   You gotta answer the question.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.440]   Do you have a real faith?
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.240]   You in, you going all in with Christ?
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   Does He influence how you date,
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.240]   what you do on the weekends, how you talk,
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   who you hang out with, your playmates,
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.960]   and your friends, and your family?
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.000]   Who do you hang out with, your playmates
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.040]   and your playground?
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.160]   Is that the scariest thing in the world to you right now?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   Don't, I'll do anything, don't tell me to change my friends.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.400]   Like that's a terrifying thought, JP.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.200]   You know, that's my story.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.240]   Came to a place where I'm like, man, I just can't do that.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.200]   I can't do Lake Louisville every weekend.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   I can't do Lower Greenville anymore, guys.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.440]   I'm out, God's calling me to something better.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.400]   I'm gonna tell you a story that kind of illustrates
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   this going all in.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.000]   It's about a guy in the 1800s, his name was Blondine.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.920]   In the 1800s, they didn't have, you know,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.360]   stadiums and TVs to watch for entertainment.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.960]   And so the circus acts was a way
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.520]   that everyone would gather around,
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.840]   crowds would gather and people would be entertained.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.400]   And so this particular man, Blondine from Paris,
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.080]   he was a tightrope walker.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.800]   And his most famous feat was he walked 1,100 feet
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   across Niagara Falls on a tight walk.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.520]   He was the first person ever to walk across Niagara Falls
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.360]   on a tightrope.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.440]   And when he did it, I mean, the crowds from Canada
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.000]   and America came around and gathered and would go crazy
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.880]   to watch this guy.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.840]   And just like us, you know, to be entertained,
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.760]   you gotta keep making it crazier and crazier.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.000]   And so he would do it on stilts, he did it blindfolded.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.440]   He did it one day where he cooked an egg out there
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.000]   and ate an omelet in the middle of the tightrope
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.960]   over Niagara Falls.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.200]   And on this one particular day,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.600]   as thousands of people gathered around,
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.820]   he pushed a wheelbarrow across it, blindfolded.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.720]   And the wheelbarrow was full of concrete,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.320]   350 pounds of concrete.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.000]   And he pushed it to the other side and he emptied it out.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.400]   And he began to interact with the crowds as he often does.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.720]   And he says, "Do you guys believe I can walk
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.560]   "across this rope?"
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.700]   And they said, "You can, you're the great Blondine.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.820]   "We know you can."
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.100]   And he said, "Do you believe that I can do it
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.120]   "with this wheelbarrow?"
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.400]   And they said, "Yes, you can, you're the great Blondine."
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.080]   And he said, "Do you believe that I can push someone
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.840]   "across the tightrope in this wheelbarrow?"
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.240]   And they said, "Yes, you're the great Blondine.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   "Of course you can."
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.440]   And there was one particularly enthusiastic fan
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.920]   right there front and center.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.520]   And he said, "What about you?
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.660]   "Do you believe I can push someone across this tightrope
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.680]   "in the wheelbarrow?"
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.640]   And he said, "Of course."
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   The crowds got silence as this dialogue happened.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.000]   He said, "Of course you're the great Blondine.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.580]   "I've seen you do it.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.560]   "I know you can."
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.600]   He said, "Great, get in the wheelbarrow."
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.920]   And the crowds listened as the man refused.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.580]   He said, "I can't do that."
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.520]   And it's such a picture of so many of us praising God,
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.680]   worshiping with the crowd.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.440]   We love you, Jesus.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.560]   Thank you for dying on the cross.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.520]   Thank you for paying for our sins.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.160]   We have so much faith in you.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.360]   We have so much faith in you.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.800]   He says, "Hey, great, put your life in my hands."
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.400]   Date how I desire you to date.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.320]   Hang out and fellowship in a way that honors me.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.480]   Have conversations that honor me.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.360]   Can I have the time that you spend on your computer?
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:17.480]   Can I control, for the sake of your own freedom,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.160]   the way you dress and who you hang out with
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.720]   and what you find identity in
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.300]   and how you spend your money?
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.260]   And where you work and what you do for fun
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.300]   and whom you love?
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.140]   No, Jesus.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.880]   We just wanna be with the fans.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.200]   Don't call us to anything, Jesus.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   I have a faith.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.040]   Don't make me use it, Jesus.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:53.180]   I don't wanna go through the furnace, Jesus.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.640]   I have a faith, I hope I never have to use it, Jesus.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.620]   Don't call me to stand out.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.460]   They're gonna make fun of me.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.060]   I'm gonna be left alone, Jesus.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.220]   It's interesting, and I didn't know this
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.640]   when I first heard this story,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.260]   but Blondine's manager eventually did go
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.380]   across that rope with him.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.280]   And I find it ironic because he had spent
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.240]   the most time with him.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.680]   He had seen that he had done it the most
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.600]   and had the most faith.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.420]   In his ability.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.740]   And so of course he said, "Hey, I'm willing."
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:33.460]   And that's what God is calling you to right now.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.960]   I hope some of you are tired of playing
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.020]   the Christian games.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.880]   I hope right now as you sit in a seat,
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.780]   see, you can't decide how you're gonna date
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.200]   when you're in the hotel room,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.120]   when you're in the back seat,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.160]   when you're in your apartment alone.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.480]   That's not when you say, "Okay, now how far am I gonna go?"
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.560]   Right now, you say, "Hey, Jesus, you got my celibacy, man.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.380]   "If I'm the 40-year-old virgin, it's all good.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.600]   "Make a movie about me.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.220]   "It's all good.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.840]   "Hey, Jesus, I'm not attracted to the same sex.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.460]   "Doesn't seem fair.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.240]   "I think you're gonna change that in me.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.500]   "But even if you don't, I'm not gonna compromise.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:20.620]   "I'll die celibate, go to heaven, inherit your kingdom,
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.040]   "hashtag winning.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.020]   "Let's go."
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.740]   You ready?
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.660]   You ready to go all in with Christ?
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:38.340]   He's not making you get up on the cross.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.720]   He got up on the cross for you,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.320]   but he's asking you to carry it.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.060]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.400]   (pastor clicks tongue)
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:59.260]   Father, in the midst of blazing hot furnace,
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:06.740]   strengthen our resolve to cry out to a watching world
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:13.180]   that may hate us to burn us up.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.420]   Give us the courage to stand out.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.420]   Give us the courage to take up our cross tomorrow
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   when we wake up in our office, in our relationship,
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.680]   in all that we do.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.220]   Father, help us to worship you.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:39.460]   Help us to give our entire lives and existence
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.780]   and everything for you.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.220]   Would you create not an audience of this place,
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.660]   but an army to march against everything
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.760]   that is wicked in our culture to stand for truth?
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.140]   And would you help us to do that winsomely
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.140]   and lovingly with compassion and grace?
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:03.500]   And in the midst of the fiery challenges of this life,
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.160]   give us the faith to scream out, burn us up.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:17.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
