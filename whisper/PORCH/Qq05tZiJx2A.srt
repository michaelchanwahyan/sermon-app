1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,740
 (gentle music)

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,440
 - Well, I want you to imagine with me for a moment

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,040
 that this is a picture of your life.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,960
 And not just a picture of your life,

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
 but really a picture of everything great about your life.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,720
 Everything that makes you great,

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,800
 imagine that it's right here.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,760
 And so basically, this is a picture of your social media.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,160
 This is your, I am the greatest album.

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,360
 This is your Instagram.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,200
 This is your Twitter followers.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,280
 This is your accomplishments.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,880
 And so for you, I don't know if it's where you've been,

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,520
 you hanging off that cliff there at the Grand Canyon

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
 or sitting there on the beach grabbing that selfie.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
 I don't know if it's the way that you look

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,220
 that you find identity in.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,600
 Maybe you walk into a room and it's all eyes on you.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
 I don't know for you if it's your athletic accomplishments,

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
 you know, the great things that you've done,

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,960
 clearly not mine.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,420
 I don't know what it is that you find identity in.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,680
 Maybe for you it's climbing the corporate ladder,

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,180
 trying to show the world how fantastic you are

27
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,520
 as you put that degree into use

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 so that you can get to the top and tell everyone,

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,880
 "Look at me, look at what I've done.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
 "Look how I took that degree and I made a name for myself."

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,160
 I don't know what it is about you

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,000
 that makes you think you're great, but it's on this.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,960
 I want you to picture it on this screen.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,480
 Maybe it's your fashion sense.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,640
 Maybe for you it's the things that you put on

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,360
 that you find identity in.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,880
 Maybe it's the things that you wear.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,320
 But for this moment, stop thinking about just the oddity

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,800
 of this screen being up here and think about

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,200
 what you find identity in, what makes you great.

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,940
 Once upon a time it was something like this.

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,160
 Maybe it's become a resume now.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,040
 Maybe it's a salary.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,940
 Maybe it's a relationship status.

45
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,760
 Maybe it's a car.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 What is it for you that you believe

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,000
 defines greatness in your life?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,080
 It's interesting that we've actually invented this word.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,960
 Our generation has this word, selfie.

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,360
 They've put it in the dictionary, in Webster's dictionary.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,180
 There was an email that went viral this week

52
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,040
 from the American Psychiatric Association

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,400
 that says there's a new disease, selfitis.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,280
 I don't know if you guys saw that.

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,840
 I looked it up on Snopes, wasn't true.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,760
 Time Magazine said about us in May 7th, 2014,

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,960
 this is not only the generation of the self,

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,680
 it's the generation of the selfie.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,320
 It's interesting that 10 years ago

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,760
 no one took a picture of themself

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,300
 and then today we actually have phones

62
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,320
 with cameras on the front so that we can.

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 And not only that, but we have this word,

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
 this phenomenon, this hashtag.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,400
 And so I don't know if you take selfies or hate selfies

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,440
 or make fun of selfies and take them.

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,160
 But there is something interesting they're saying about us

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,520
 that I believe is rooted and grounded in truth

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,520
 that we are the most narcissistic generation ever to live.

70
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,880
 And a selfie life, it's not just a bad idea.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,880
 It is actually a wasted life.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
 And if you continue to pursue it

73
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,560
 and you continue to think about it,

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,840
 it will literally make you sick.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,760
 It will make you ill.

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,720
 And you're feeding something in yourself

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
 that you can't shake.

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,100
 You continue to think about yourself

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,760
 and the more you think about yourself,

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,940
 the more you think about yourself.

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,200
 You can't stop thinking about yourself.

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
 And then you begin to think

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
 that everybody else is thinking about you.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
 And then you begin to have conversations

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
 in your head about you.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,280
 And then you begin having conversations in your head

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,960
 with others as they're having conversations about you.

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,800
 And then you begin to think,

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,220
 what does my boss think about me?

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,400
 What does she think about me?

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
 What does he think about me?

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,760
 What do they think about me?

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
 What do my coworkers think about me?

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,840
 What does everyone around me,

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
 what does that person I just said hello to

96
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,520
 during the meet and greet, what do they think about me?

97
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
 What does everyone think about me?

98
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,100
 And then what happens is our entire lives go by.

99
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,800
 Some of you are like, I'll tell you in a minute, okay.

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,340
 When your entire lives go by

101
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,940
 and you spent thinking about you

102
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,500
 and why while self-itis is not real,

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,060
 narcissistic personality disorder is.

104
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,100
 And narcissism is a real phenomenon.

105
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,380
 In fact, we're three times more likely

106
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,740
 to be narcissistic than any other generation

107
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,560
 that has ever lived.

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,220
 In 1992, 80% of people under 23

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,360
 wanted to one day have a job with greater responsibility.

110
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,160
 10 years later, 60% did.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,020
 Millennials received so many participation trophies

112
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,100
 growing up that 40% of them think

113
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,660
 they should be promoted every two years,

114
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,100
 regardless of performance.

115
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,980
 Eight out of 10 believe they are very important.

116
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,260
 In 1950, that was 12% thought they were very important.

117
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,560
 Now it's 80%.

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,480
 Millennials' number one goal is to get rich

119
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,600
 and their number two goal, our number two goal,

120
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,540
 is to get famous.

121
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,520
 Most everyone here tonight is classified as a millennial,

122
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,740
 someone born between 1980 and 2000.

123
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,640
 The number one question they are asking

124
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,480
 when considering opportunities is what's in it for me?

125
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,400
 And 96% of us believe we will do something great

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,460
 with our lives.

127
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,160
 And so as we move through this series quarter life crisis,

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,880
 we've covered your career,

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,800
 we covered your money problems,

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,460
 and tonight we're going to talk about being self-obsessed,

131
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,580
 continuing to think about yourself,

132
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,620
 which I would argue is the root of every quarter life crisis

133
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,560
 but specifically what's happening is we're realizing

134
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,840
 that we're not so great or worse, we think we are.

135
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,560
 And that is causing in us and around us

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,320
 this phenomenon of a quarter life crisis,

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,280
 of stress and anxiety and worry

138
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
 and things that we can't shake

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
 which actually feed these thoughts

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,480
 that cause us to think about ourselves more.

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,460
 And so tonight I want to ask two questions

142
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,760
 from a scripture that I believe will help us

143
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,400
 combat self-obsession.

144
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,580
 And then before you leave here this evening,

145
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,880
 I hope to offer you a solution.

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,460
 And to set this up, we're going to look at the life

147
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,040
 of John the Baptist.

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,240
 Last time I taught on narcissism,

149
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,300
 it was the Generation Y series or Gen Y series,

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,560
 we looked at a negative example in the disciples.

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
 The disciples over and over and over were asking Jesus

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
 who was the greatest,

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,040
 to which Jesus could have easily said I am,

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,840
 but he didn't, he said no, I've come to serve.

155
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,420
 And whoever wants to be great among you must also serve,

156
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,660
 for whoever wants to be first must be last

157
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,300
 and make themselves servant of all, this crazy phenomenon.

158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,720
 And so the disciples missed it,

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
 they were a great negative example.

160
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,640
 Today, tonight rather, I want to look at a positive example.

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 And man, we don't talk a lot about John the Baptist.

162
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,460
 We're going to be in the book of John,

163
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,760
 who was the Apostle John,

164
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,960
 not to be confused with John the Baptist.

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,640
 The Apostle John's going to be writing about John the Baptist

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,800
 in the text that we're in, John chapter three.

167
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,180
 So Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the New Testament.

168
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,560
 Turn to John chapter three if you have your Bibles.

169
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,580
 I'm gonna set this up in Mark chapter one,

170
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,420
 you don't need to turn there,

171
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,220
 I'm just gonna read to you starting in verse four,

172
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,060
 and it says this,

173
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,840
 'cause we need to know about John the Baptist.

174
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,140
 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness

175
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,740
 preaching a baptism of repentance

176
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,940
 for the forgiveness of sin.

177
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,200
 So this is his message,

178
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,280
 you need to repent and be baptized.

179
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
 That is, you need to turn from your sin.

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,420
 You have, up until now,

181
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,340
 you have lived a life obsessed about yourself,

182
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,540
 but when you come into a relationship with the one true God,

183
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,380
 you begin to live for him.

184
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,260
 This marks believers, this marks Christians,

185
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,940
 this marks Christ followers.

186
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,880
 You live the life for yourself,

187
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,140
 and then when you come into a relationship with God,

188
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,300
 now through the death and resurrection of Jesus,

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,380
 you begin to live a life for him.

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,140
 And so John is teaching this message,

191
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,540
 hey, you need to turn from your sin and turn to God.

192
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,300
 And so you might think of John the Baptist as an oddball.

193
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,420
 The whole Judean countryside, it says,

194
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,380
 and all the people of Jerusalem.

195
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,560
 So thousands of people went out to him,

196
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
 confessing their sins.

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,600
 They were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

198
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,900
 Now some odd things about John.

199
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,660
 John wore clothing made of camel's hair

200
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,020
 with a leather belt around his waist,

201
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,700
 and he ate locusts and wild honey.

202
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,100
 And this was his message.

203
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,020
 He didn't have big screens and lights, okay?

204
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,540
 He didn't have lots of crazy things.

205
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,940
 He didn't have cars on the stage or anything like that.

206
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,260
 His message was simply, after me comes one

207
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,900
 who is more powerful than I.

208
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,540
 The straps of whose sandals I am not worthy

209
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,700
 to stoop down and untie.

210
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,120
 This is his sermon.

211
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,500
 Hey, guys, gather around.

212
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,120
 Gather around, gather around, gather around.

213
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,420
 Hey, you need to turn from your sin,

214
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,220
 and someone's coming who's greater than me.

215
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
 The end, let's pray.

216
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,020
 This is what he's doing.

217
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,000
 Hey, come here, everybody, come here.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
 You need to hear this.

219
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,060
 And thousands were gathering around him,

220
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,700
 and so you think locusts and honey and camel's hair.

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,140
 Listen, John the Baptist was the original hipster, okay?

222
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,080
 He invented hipster, okay?

223
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,060
 So while you think locust and honey,

224
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,660
 I want you to think like kale.

225
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,380
 He just bought a Vitamix,

226
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,020
 and he's on a gluten-free diet, this guy.

227
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,540
 If he was here today, he'd have horned rim glasses,

228
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,260
 and he'd be rocking skinny jeans

229
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,140
 with his top buttoned, right?

230
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,960
 This is this guy.

231
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,180
 He's the OG hipster, John the Baptist.

232
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,620
 And so people are gathering.

233
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,140
 You're like, well, that's not in the text.

234
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,940
 It's in the commentary.

235
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,620
 (congregation laughing)

236
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,380
 People are gathering around him.

237
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,940
 Thousands are coming to him.

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,280
 He's got a ministry that's rocking, man.

239
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,880
 And so he's doing this deal,

240
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,680
 this kind of strange phenomenon called baptism.

241
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
 And so baptism is just a word that we get.

242
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,820
 You can think of like a cucumber

243
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
 that is submerged in a dill solution

244
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,200
 that later becomes a pickle.

245
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,340
 It takes on a new form.

246
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,800
 This is where we get the word baptism,

247
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 that as people go underwater and they come up, okay,

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,940
 they raise to new life.

249
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,780
 Not that baptism saves you.

250
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,340
 It is a symbol, the repentance,

251
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,420
 that they would turn from their sins

252
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,300
 and turn to God and walk in faith in him,

253
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,540
 that salvation comes through faith.

254
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,740
 But baptism is the symbol

255
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,640
 that people are participating with in John.

256
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,960
 He's saying, hey, you have lived for you.

257
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,140
 Now live for the one to come.

258
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,380
 Okay, John three, verse 23.

259
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,120
 Now John was also baptizing in Anon near Selim

260
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,760
 because there was plenty of water

261
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
 and people were coming and being baptized.

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,180
 And then it says parenthetically,

263
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,200
 this was before John was put in prison.

264
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,220
 An argument developed between some of John's disciples

265
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,140
 and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.

266
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,140
 They came to John and said to him,

267
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,420
 so there's this bickering going on.

268
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,520
 This is some of his disciples.

269
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,640
 They come up and they're kind of concerned.

270
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,820
 They said, Rabbi, that man who was with you

271
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,100
 on the other side of the Jordan,

272
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,640
 the one you testified about,

273
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,260
 the one you told us about, the story you told us about,

274
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,420
 look, he's baptizing and everyone is going to him.

275
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,540
 They're saying, hey, hold on.

276
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,800
 His ministry's growing faster than ours.

277
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,040
 He's becoming more popular than we are.

278
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,160
 What's going on?

279
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
 And to this John replied,

280
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,460
 a person can receive only what is given them from heaven.

281
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,400
 What a crazy phenomenon that John's not threatened

282
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,480
 by someone more popular.

283
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,100
 And he just says, hey, what others think of me

284
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,140
 and what others think of him, that's up to God.

285
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,020
 By the way, the other person was Jesus, John's cousin.

286
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,200
 And he's just saying, hey, whatever people think of him

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,340
 and whatever people think of me, whoever he has,

288
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,140
 whatever is given him and whatever is given me,

289
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,440
 that comes from God.

290
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,240
 What a crazy phenomenon just to actually trust in God.

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,360
 It's one thing to say you believe in him.

292
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,080
 A whole 'nother thing to walk in trust of him.

293
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,360
 And so the first question that I want to ask this evening

294
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,620
 is what do you have that you have not been given?

295
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,200
 And that might be a strange question

296
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,840
 in talking about narcissism, but it's actually not.

297
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,100
 Because if you really trust that any gifts and talents,

298
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,000
 anything that's on that screen,

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,080
 anything in that album of My Greatest Life

300
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,720
 is a gift to you from God, what can you boast in?

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,880
 How can you boast in something you haven't earned?

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,580
 I came out with a well-decorated letter jacket.

303
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,240
 In fact, one of those patches says Allstate.

304
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,080
 And it would be crazy for me to show that off.

305
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
 I'm like, check this out.

306
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,740
 Why?

307
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,420
 Because it's not mine.

308
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,900
 Okay, I want to just confess something

309
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,180
 kind of embarrassing to you.

310
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,320
 I desperately wanted to make varsity my sophomore year.

311
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,520
 I desperately wanted to.

312
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,280
 And when I didn't, I came up with this grand plan

313
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,080
 that I was gonna wear my brother's letter jacket.

314
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
 And the crazy thing about that is

315
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,720
 I went to a very small high school,

316
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,260
 so people would come up to me and be like,

317
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,640
 hey, that's not yours.

318
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
 You didn't earn it.

319
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,160
 Why weren't you at the game Friday night?

320
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,660
 It's 'cause you're on JV, dog.

321
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,140
 And that's not your jacket.

322
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,320
 How can you boast in the accomplishments of someone else?

323
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,800
 Everything that you have, you've been given.

324
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,500
 Let this sink in.

325
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,740
 And you're like, no, man, you don't understand.

326
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,580
 I'm really strong.

327
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,220
 I've been in the weight room.

328
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,140
 And that came through the weight room.

329
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,340
 Oh, yeah?

330
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,180
 Well, I bet if I lifted weights as much as you,

331
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,340
 I wouldn't be as strong as you.

332
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,500
 Maybe genetically, you've been predisposed by Creator

333
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,340
 to be strong.

334
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,920
 You're like, well, I'm pretty.

335
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,100
 You know, I'm really pretty.

336
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,340
 God made you pretty.

337
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,100
 What did you do to get pretty?

338
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,180
 Well, I can dunk a basketball.

339
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,100
 Cool.

340
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,600
 You're probably tall.

341
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,100
 No, I'm 5'10" and I can dunk a basketball.

342
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,940
 Really neat.

343
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,580
 I bet you have some big calf muscles.

344
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,300
 God probably made you that way.

345
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,780
 What do you, you're like, well, I'm really smart.

346
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,980
 Cool, God made you smart.

347
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
 How can you boast in your intelligence?

348
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,860
 God gave you your IQ.

349
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,700
 No, I developed it.

350
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,540
 No, you didn't.

351
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,500
 Well, maybe you developed it, but listen,

352
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,740
 he's the one that gave you the potential to develop it.

353
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,360
 What do you have that you haven't been given?

354
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,620
 Man, I work hard, JP.

355
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,380
 You don't even know.

356
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,880
 Hey, God put you in a place

357
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,860
 where there's prosperity all around you.

358
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,700
 I mean, you could have been born anywhere to any parents.

359
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,620
 No, man, you don't even know

360
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,820
 the adversity that I rose up against.

361
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,660
 God gave you the ability to even do that.

362
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,580
 What do you have that you can boast in?

363
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,900
 What do you have that has not been given to you?

364
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,900
 And when you get this mindset, all of a sudden,

365
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,140
 in this world of eight billion people,

366
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,700
 you begin to come smaller and smaller and smaller

367
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,540
 and smaller.

368
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,100
 And you begin to realize that outside of God,

369
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,280
 your life isn't all that relevant,

370
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,240
 that you're a small player in a big play

371
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
 that ain't about you.

372
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,040
 And it's one of the most healthy perspectives

373
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,100
 that we can have is to believe that this is about God.

374
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,040
 And so you have been given some gifts.

375
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,140
 You've been given some talents.

376
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,440
 You've been put in a position of influence,

377
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,440
 a specific neighborhood, a specific apartment complex.

378
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,020
 You can do things maybe that no one else can do.

379
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,800
 Maybe you have a unique way of thinking,

380
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,360
 maybe a specific intelligence,

381
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,100
 maybe a hobby that you've perfected.

382
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,480
 And the reason that you have that is for God.

383
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 The reason that you can do that

384
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,400
 is so that you can give him glory

385
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
 with whatever gifts, talents, resources, abilities,

386
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
 people you know, places of influence,

387
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,320
 whatever that is, you have been entrusted with that for him.

388
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,520
 In Luke 12, 48, it just says this really scary passage,

389
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,840
 to whom much is given, much is expected,

390
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,400
 that God expects a return on his investment,

391
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
 that he's invested something in you

392
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,880
 and he expects a return on it,

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,680
 not so that you can earn salvation from him.

394
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,080
 That's been given to you also freely from him

395
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,400
 through Christ, but because you've been given salvation,

396
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,920
 you begin to use those gifts, talents, resources,

397
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,560
 influences for him.

398
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,920
 That's what John the Baptist is doing here.

399
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,440
 Remember, he has thousands of followers

400
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,840
 and he's saying, hey man, it's not about me.

401
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,800
 Whatever I have has been given to me by God, whom I trust.

402
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,600
 First Corinthians four, verse seven, says it like this.

403
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,480
 For who makes you different from anyone else?

404
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280
 What do you have that you did not receive?

405
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
 And if you did receive it, why do you boast

406
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 as though you did not?

407
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,000
 And it says in this text, in John chapter three,

408
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,880
 that you can only receive what is given to you.

409
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,720
 And so what this means, an application here,

410
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,120
 is that you cannot do everything,

411
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,200
 that you have some very specific gifts,

412
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,560
 that maybe you weren't made fast,

413
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
 maybe you weren't made strong,

414
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,400
 maybe you weren't made pretty.

415
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,240
 And that's okay, because you can trust God in that.

416
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,760
 And so that, what's the application there?

417
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,480
 Well, one, you don't have to judge those who were.

418
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,560
 Because as you're spending mental equity doing that,

419
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,720
 you're not realizing what are the gifts and talents

420
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,040
 that have been entrusted to you to use for God.

421
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,680
 So you can only think about so many things,

422
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
 and so if you're constantly thinking

423
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,320
 about other people's gifts,

424
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,280
 you can't develop the ones that have been entrusted to you.

425
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,960
 And so here's the deal, man, I know our parents,

426
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 mine did, Jonathan, you can do anything.

427
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,520
 Anybody ever tell you that?

428
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,360
 My parents ever tell you that?

429
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,680
 Man, you can do anything, you put your mind to it.

430
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,880
 You can do anything, anybody ever heard that?

431
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,600
 Man, I'm the bearer of bad news.

432
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,680
 You can't, you can't do anything.

433
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,920
 Man, there's just some things I can't do.

434
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,880
 There's just some things I'm not very good at.

435
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,120
 I'm six foot seven, 250 pounds,

436
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,080
 I'm not a very good jockey, okay?

437
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
 I couldn't ride a horse for a living,

438
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
 or race a horse for a living,

439
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
 I wouldn't be very good at it.

440
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
 Those guys are little and light.

441
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,880
 I'm the opposite of little and light, okay?

442
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,920
 I would not be a very good jockey.

443
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,440
 And there's a long list of things I'm not very good at.

444
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,640
 You're like, six, seven, 250, basketball's gotta be, nope.

445
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,720
 Nope, sorry to disappoint you.

446
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,000
 That's not one of them either.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,680
 And so it's not my job to sit on the side and say,

448
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,360
 well, why aren't they all good at that?

449
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,400
 And how come he can ride a horse fast, but I can't?

450
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,160
 No, I say, God, what did you make me to do,

451
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
 and how can I do that for your glory?

452
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,880
 What gifts and talents did you entrust to me for you,

453
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,160
 and how can I use those for your glory,

454
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,600
 to honor you in the way that I do them?

455
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,320
 And that's a great question for you to answer.

456
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
 And so here's a question, do you earnestly believe

457
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,840
 that what you have comes from God?

458
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,920
 Do you earnestly believe that what you have comes from God?

459
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,320
 See, John the Baptist here, he was very influential.

460
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,400
 And the goal of his influence was to point others to Jesus.

461
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,800
 And so are the goal of your success and your desires

462
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,400
 to point others to Christ, how are you doing at that?

463
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,960
 That's why God left you here.

464
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,240
 I mean, you know that God could have taken you home

465
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,800
 as soon as he saved you,

466
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,400
 assuming that you're a Jesus follower.

467
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,120
 As soon as you trusted in Christ for the forgiveness

468
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,800
 of your sins, his death and resurrection

469
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,120
 as a payment for your sins,

470
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 as soon as you trusted in that,

471
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,960
 you're gonna be with God forever in heaven,

472
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
 and he could have just said,

473
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,280
 hey, I'm gonna take you there to be with me now,

474
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,080
 but he didn't, he said, no, I'm gonna leave you there,

475
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,120
 right where you are, I'm gonna put you

476
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,480
 in some very specific places because I wanna use you.

477
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,160
 I want you to take the gifts and the talents

478
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,440
 and the resources and the places and people of influence

479
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,360
 that I've entrusted to you and use them for me.

480
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,000
 And I'll see you real soon, face to face.

481
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,600
 And John the Baptist got this.

482
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,400
 He got this really well, he's happy

483
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
 that Jesus's ministry is growing beyond his.

484
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
 He says this.

485
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,680
 You yourselves can testify that I said,

486
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,080
 I am not the Messiah, but I am sent ahead of him.

487
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
 The bride belongs to the bridegroom.

488
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
 The friend who attends the bridegroom

489
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,960
 awaits and listens for him and is full of joy

490
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,760
 when he hears the bridegroom's voice.

491
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,440
 That joy is mine and it is now complete.

492
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,400
 And then he says this beautiful prayer,

493
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
 this beautiful statement that you've heard,

494
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,480
 he must become greater, I must become less.

495
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,880
 He must increase, I must decrease.

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
 And so John gives a great illustration of a wedding.

497
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,680
 I don't know if you've ever stood

498
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,240
 beside someone at a wedding.

499
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,800
 So maybe you had a bridesmaid

500
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,440
 or you've been a bridesmaid at a wedding.

501
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,880
 Maybe you felt like I'm always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

502
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
 Maybe you've been a groomsman at a wedding.

503
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,660
 How ludicrous would it be if you showed up

504
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,160
 to the wedding in a bridal gown

505
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
 and you said, no, I'm sick of this.

506
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,480
 (congregation laughing)

507
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,360
 No, everybody's, no, this is my show, okay?

508
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,200
 No, give me those flowers, all right?

509
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,880
 This is my show.

510
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
 How ludicrous would it be if you stood up at a wedding

511
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,080
 that is somebody else's show.

512
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,880
 You're there as a supportive role

513
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,040
 and you said, nah, not anymore, guys.

514
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,760
 I'm on the scene now, right?

515
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,460
 You're a groomsman, you went and you rented your tux.

516
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,080
 You were supposed to have a different color vest.

517
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,560
 You switched it out, you showed up there.

518
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 He said, no, I'm the groom.

519
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,440
 She's mine now.

520
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,760
 (congregation laughing)

521
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,600
 It'd be crazy.

522
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,800
 It would be crazy and you are a part of a wedding.

523
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,760
 In this metaphor that Christ gave us in Ephesians five

524
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,200
 and really several times in the scriptures,

525
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,500
 you are a part of a wedding and you are a supportive role

526
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,060
 and he is the groom and his church,

527
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,720
 of which I hope you are a part of, is his bride.

528
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,320
 The church, not you, not you specifically,

529
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
 but you gathered together belonging to his body

530
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,880
 is his bride.

531
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,960
 And you don't wanna stand up and distract everyone from him.

532
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
 That would not be loving.

533
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,360
 And so my second question this evening

534
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,320
 is are you stealing God's glory?

535
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,920
 See, you're here to glorify the Father.

536
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
 Are you stealing his glory?

537
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,520
 If you are living for you,

538
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,600
 then the reality is you have missed your purpose in life.

539
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
 Everybody's always looking for their purpose.

540
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,180
 Man, what is my purpose?

541
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,200
 Why am I here?

542
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
 If you have lived your life for your selfie,

543
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
 you have missed your purpose.

544
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,160
 You have, it has been lost on you why God left you here

545
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,640
 after he saved you in spite of you.

546
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
 And that's gross.

547
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,280
 Anytime someone grabs the attention,

548
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,400
 they're a glory thief.

549
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,360
 It's always gross.

550
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,160
 Yesterday was Memorial Day, an incredible holiday

551
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,480
 where we remember those who have lost their life

552
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,020
 serving our country for our freedom.

553
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,320
 And so the way that we always celebrate Memorial Day

554
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,800
 is we attend a parade.

555
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,520
 This year I was in the parade and had this,

556
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,120
 I rode this orange car, okay?

557
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,240
 It was like this orange hot rod in the parade.

558
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
 There it is, right?

559
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
 And so there we are.

560
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,920
 We're gonna go to the parade.

561
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
 We're gonna be in the parade.

562
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,720
 Well, what's interesting about this car,

563
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,280
 there's nothing like celebrating those

564
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
 who have given their life for our freedom

565
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,440
 than saying, hey, look at me, I'm in an orange car

566
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,360
 in a parade, I'll throw candy at you

567
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,840
 if you just give me some attention.

568
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,600
 And so we're in this parade,

569
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
 and what's funny about this car,

570
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,040
 okay, and this is weird, I know, so let me explain this.

571
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,000
 When you shift the car into reverse,

572
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,200
 you know how some trucks go beep, beep, beep

573
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
 when you shift into reverse?

574
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,640
 You guys tracking with me?

575
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,320
 Trucks go beep, beep, beep when you shift into reverse?

576
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,360
 Okay, this car, that orange one,

577
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,960
 when you shift it into reverse,

578
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,080
 it goes, attention, please, this car is backing up,

579
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,320
 real loud, it's got this like megaphone in the back.

580
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,400
 I'm not kidding, you shift it in reverse,

581
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
 and it goes, attention, please, this car is backing up.

582
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,320
 And so we were gonna be in the parade,

583
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,880
 but then it was raining and it's convertible,

584
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
 and so I didn't know if we were going to,

585
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
 and so then we showed up late for the parade,

586
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
 and we're the very last car in the parade,

587
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,520
 and the parade ends at a party in my daughter's school.

588
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,880
 And so we pull up to her school,

589
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,140
 and there's this parking for parade vehicles only,

590
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,360
 the street's blocked off,

591
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,280
 and so everybody's gathered in the parking lot,

592
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,480
 hundreds of people, and there's this soldier talking

593
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,440
 and saying some great things,

594
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,600
 and then he begins to pray.

595
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,800
 I don't know what happened.

596
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,880
 (congregation laughing)

597
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,720
 Huh?

598
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,540
 - He's thinking of it.

599
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,480
 - Okay, and so this soldier,

600
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,240
 he's talking, and everybody begins to pray,

601
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,980
 and I pull up, okay, and I'm shifting into park,

602
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,500
 and it's an old car, and he gets stuck in reverse.

603
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,800
 Everybody's got their heads bowed, hundreds of people,

604
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,960
 and he goes, "Attention, please!"

605
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,540
 And everybody turns around, and I'm like.

606
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,760
 (congregation laughing)

607
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,280
 Am I holding up Weston?

608
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,400
 (congregation laughing)

609
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,720
 And it's gross, man.

610
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,500
 It's gross because some of us live our lives like that.

611
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,240
 People are trying to focus on God.

612
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,540
 They wanna know God.

613
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,720
 Every person who's ever been created

614
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,480
 has something inside of them

615
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,160
 who wants to know their creator.

616
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,000
 Your strongest atheist friend has something in him

617
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,280
 that longs to be with Jesus and reconcile to God,

618
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,920
 and God has you there,

619
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,320
 and he wants to communicate that to them through you,

620
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
 and you show up on the scene, and you say,

621
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,760
 "Attention, please, look at me.

622
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 "I'm fast, I dress well, I'm talented, I'm gifted.

623
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,020
 "I got a lot going for me.

624
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,900
 "Check me out.

625
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,660
 "I've been thinking about me all day, and you should too."

626
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,860
 And it's gross.

627
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,040
 It's just like the one who shows up to the wedding,

628
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,660
 who was invited to the wedding,

629
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,460
 but wants to be the center of the show.

630
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,240
 We become glory thieves.

631
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,660
 And so your life, it's God's wedding,

632
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,900
 and you're playing the supporting role,

633
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,040
 and I think literally the most foolish thing,

634
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,160
 and I weigh those words carefully.

635
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,300
 I know I said the most foolish thing

636
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,140
 beyond rejecting Jesus,

637
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,540
 which is really one in the same with what I'm about to say,

638
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,740
 is you believing that this life is about you.

639
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,000
 It's one of the most foolish things that you can do

640
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,300
 is to think that this life is all about you,

641
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,560
 'cause it's not.

642
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,360
 And that thought, when you feed it,

643
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,900
 it has really serious consequences.

644
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,000
 Really serious consequences.

645
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,800
 I was, I got to play, and this is such a weird thing to say,

646
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,720
 it's like this sermon's all about me,

647
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,920
 but I got to play in a movie once, okay?

648
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,560
 And I got to play this kind of supportive role,

649
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,440
 and that's not even true.

650
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,040
 I had this cameo, okay?

651
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,480
 I was on the screen for 15 seconds, okay?

652
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,960
 And I had two lines, and then I got to get in a fight

653
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,380
 with a guy much smaller than me who beat me.

654
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,240
 And so that was my role in this movie,

655
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,440
 and the movie was about, it was the story of Joseph.

656
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,720
 It was a modern-day telling of the story of Joseph,

657
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 Seasons of Gray, maybe you've seen it.

658
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,520
 And so here's the deal.

659
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,000
 I'm on the screen 15 seconds, man,

660
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,360
 and maybe you've seen it, maybe you missed me, okay?

661
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,840
 But I'm in the movie, I promise.

662
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,400
 And so how crazy would it be if I walked away from that,

663
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,800
 and I went and told my family and my friends,

664
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,760
 "Hey, have you seen this movie?

665
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 "It's all about me."

666
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,740
 No, it's about me, and I'm the main character.

667
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,120
 It's all about me.

668
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,800
 And because you know what?

669
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,840
 My family and friends and the ones who trust me,

670
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,480
 you know what, they'd believe me.

671
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 They'd be like, "Man, that's awesome.

672
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,080
 "You got a movie all about you."

673
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,520
 But eventually, they're gonna see the movie,

674
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,880
 and they're gonna say, "You're stupid.

675
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,380
 (congregation laughing)

676
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,480
 "It wasn't about you.

677
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,960
 "I don't even think you were in it.

678
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,420
 (congregation laughing)

679
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,880
 "Oh, you were the prisoner, oh yeah, I did see, okay.

680
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,080
 "The tall, goofy guy, I did see you.

681
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,920
 "You were the 15 seconds, two lines, and you got whooped."

682
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,800
 Okay, it would be crazy.

683
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,440
 And likewise, if you live this life all about you,

684
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,760
 they're gonna find out.

685
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,880
 Every knee bows and every tongue confesses

686
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,760
 Jesus Christ is Lord.

687
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,240
 And you get to the end of this race,

688
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,280
 and you find out that the billions of people

689
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,600
 who went before you, it wasn't about them either except one.

690
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,080
 The one who died and came back to life.

691
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,440
 The one who was there at the beginning.

692
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,620
 The one who formed the world with his hands.

693
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,840
 The one who told the waters where to stop,

694
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,280
 mountains where to rise.

695
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,200
 The one who created the sky and the sun and the moon

696
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,560
 and the stars and the earth as we know it,

697
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,120
 and you and your mother's womb and every hair on your head,

698
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,040
 and marked out your boundaries and when

699
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,560
 and how you would live.

700
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,920
 It was made for him, and so he must become greater,

701
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,140
 and I must become less.

702
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,860
 And we, you and I, we must begin

703
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,500
 to take our thoughts captive.

704
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,640
 We must stop thinking about ourselves,

705
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,080
 because if you're thinking about yourself,

706
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,680
 you can't think about others.

707
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,840
 And there's some of you here, I wanna talk to the other

708
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,280
 half of the room, like some of you are like,

709
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,640
 no, I don't even want the spotlight.

710
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,300
 I don't ever want any attention.

711
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,280
 That's rooted in pride too, that's you thinking

712
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,120
 too much of you, because you're here to reflect

713
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,880
 the glory of God, and so how can you reflect

714
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,960
 the glory of God if you're constantly afraid of men

715
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,720
 and people and what they think of you?

716
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,600
 And you've been given a platform, you have to use it.

717
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,080
 And so I realize that there's this whole other half

718
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,200
 of you who might think, no, I'm humble,

719
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,240
 I never want the spotlight, that's not humility,

720
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,880
 it's rooted in pride as well.

721
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,040
 It's equally as gross.

722
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,120
 It's equally as gross.

723
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,020
 John, let's see what he does, verse 31.

724
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:14,360
 The one who comes from above is above all, it's Jesus.

725
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,840
 The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth

726
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,540
 and speaks as one from the earth,

727
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,880
 but the one who comes from heaven is above all,

728
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
 that's Jesus.

729
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,160
 He testifies to what he has seen and heard,

730
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,900
 but no one accepts his testimony.

731
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,000
 Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.

732
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,080
 For the one whom God has sent, that's Jesus,

733
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,880
 speaks the words of God.

734
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,560
 For God gives the Spirit without limit.

735
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,760
 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything

736
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,480
 in His hands, whoever believes in the Son

737
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,040
 has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son

738
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,460
 will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them

739
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,720
 because they have not trusted in Christ

740
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,960
 and that God's wrath was satisfied on Jesus,

741
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,960
 that He got hell so that we don't have to.

742
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,380
 And so you were made, you were created,

743
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,320
 literally your heart beats in your chest,

744
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,440
 literally there is breath in your lungs

745
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,200
 so that you can point to Christ.

746
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,760
 That's why you're here, that is your purpose,

747
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,260
 that's why you are where you are,

748
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,720
 that's why you work where you work,

749
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,160
 that's why you know who you know.

750
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,680
 If you can run fast, that's why you can run fast.

751
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,400
 If you can think well, that's why you can think well.

752
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,800
 If you're smart, if you read, I don't care what you do,

753
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
 if you invent things, if you're pretty,

754
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,840
 you're pretty so that you can attract others

755
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,920
 not to yourself but through yourself to God.

756
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,960
 That is why you are here, you have to hear me

757
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,260
 because you're not gonna be around much longer.

758
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,100
 You're gonna die soon and the reason you have life

759
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,760
 is so that you can point others to Christ.

760
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,640
 And if you're not pointing others to Christ,

761
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,520
 you're distracting them from Christ.

762
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,800
 If you're saying look at me, look at me, look at me,

763
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,880
 they can't see Jesus.

764
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,920
 You've got to show them Jesus.

765
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,100
 This is, he's the king of this kingdom, King Jesus.

766
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,820
 You're a servant in the kingdom.

767
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,960
 He's the king, you're not the king.

768
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,620
 He's the king.

769
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,800
 And so you were made to point to Christ.

770
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,040
 One time I took Presley and Finley,

771
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,160
 this was before Weston was born,

772
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,660
 and we went to the greatest show on earth.

773
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,460
 Do you guys know what the greatest show on earth is?

774
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,300
 Church, that's right.

775
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,900
 No, not church, I'm just kidding.

776
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,040
 Barnum and Bailey Circus, that's right.

777
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,880
 Barnum and Bailey Circus.

778
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,640
 And so we get in the car and we go,

779
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,840
 man, I've been talking this up big.

780
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,240
 There's elephants there and tigers

781
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,780
 and this guy who can tame a tiger

782
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,220
 and they're gonna jump through hoops of fire.

783
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,300
 It's the girls.

784
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,940
 It is the greatest show on earth, okay?

785
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,140
 That's what you need to know.

786
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,380
 The greatest show on earth.

787
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,540
 And so we're on our way there

788
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,580
 to the American Airline Center

789
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,860
 and they set up this enormous sign.

790
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,180
 It was a pretty elaborate sign

791
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,140
 and it said the greatest show on earth this way.

792
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,260
 How crazy would it have been if we would have stopped?

793
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,280
 See, the girls saw that sign, they got really excited.

794
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,120
 But what if I would have said,

795
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,540
 hey, come on, let's go check it out.

796
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,860
 Let's get a closer look at the sign.

797
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
 Oh man, pull up a chair here.

798
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,160
 I'm gonna pull out some chairs.

799
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,100
 Y'all sit down, we're just gonna watch the sign.

800
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,460
 Look, it's the greatest show on earth.

801
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,580
 It says so itself.

802
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,240
 No, it says this way.

803
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,140
 It would be dumb to stop at the sign.

804
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,980
 But some of us, we wanna be such a great

805
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,780
 and elaborate and amazing sign that we're,

806
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,900
 no one sees our arrow.

807
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,940
 No one sees us pointing, no, it's him.

808
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,720
 No, the reason, the thing that you thought

809
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,700
 that was great in me, it's because of him.

810
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,160
 I'm trying to show you him.

811
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,500
 See, you are called a representative in the scripture.

812
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,060
 In Genesis, it calls you an image bearer.

813
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,940
 In 2 Corinthians 5 and Ephesians 6,

814
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,620
 it calls you an ambassador.

815
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,060
 Here's what an ambassador is.

816
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,380
 An ambassador is someone who represents their leader

817
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,580
 in a foreign land.

818
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,340
 This earth is your foreign land.

819
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,720
 You don't belong to it.

820
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,360
 But you're here as a representative of Jesus

821
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,000
 to point others to him.

822
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,260
 This is what John the Baptist is doing here

823
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,980
 in this last little section.

824
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,380
 The one who came from heaven is above everything else.

825
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,100
 And I'm not jealous of him.

826
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,740
 No, I want everyone to know him and see him.

827
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,060
 He's the greatest.

828
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,740
 The last thing I'd wanna do, guys,

829
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,620
 is distract anyone from him.

830
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,620
 And so some of us here, and this is the hard truth,

831
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,340
 is like some of us, we've wasted our life.

832
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,940
 We spent our life on us.

833
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,980
 And like no one's really gonna know Christ because of us.

834
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,000
 I know that's not very loving.

835
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,180
 But I think maybe it is,

836
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
 'cause it's the truth for some of us.

837
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,620
 And so we were made to show others Jesus.

838
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,760
 We were made to point to him,

839
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,060
 but we've just been so busy pointing at ourselves.

840
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,420
 And some of you have even experienced depression in this,

841
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,400
 and despair, because you're so focused on yourself

842
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,860
 that when things don't go your way,

843
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,620
 it's just like your whole world falls apart.

844
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,020
 Entitlement is the highest platform from which we fall.

845
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,320
 It is the highest platform from which we fall.

846
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,220
 And so I want you to know that when you live for you,

847
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,640
 you very literally become dysfunctional.

848
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,520
 I mean, you do.

849
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,740
 When you're so focused on you, you cannot function right.

850
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,900
 I've met with lots of people who were mentally ill,

851
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,580
 and I mean like diagnosed mentally ill,

852
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,020
 and very few, and I would say in the most extreme cases,

853
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,340
 almost every time, I can't even think

854
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,820
 of an exception right now, but I'm sure there is one,

855
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,220
 every time it's rooted in narcissism.

856
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,740
 It began with them thinking, much of them,

857
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,140
 and feeding that, and that growing to something

858
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,180
 that required medication, or at least someone told them so.

859
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,220
 When you get stuck on yourself,

860
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,380
 listen, we're the most narcissistic generation.

861
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,140
 We're also the most depressed generation,

862
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,240
 by far, ever to walk.

863
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,760
 You see how these things are connected?

864
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,300
 And so I don't know, man, I hate even saying this.

865
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,920
 I don't know if you guys know what happened this weekend,

866
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,220
 the Santa Barbara shooter, and I hate using him

867
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,940
 as an example, and prayed for his family earlier.

868
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,060
 We'll pray for him tonight.

869
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,100
 But this was just the last thing that he said in his video

870
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,120
 before he went on a killing spree.

871
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,180
 You girls have never been attracted to me.

872
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,380
 I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me,

873
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,100
 but I will punish you all for it.

874
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,940
 It's an injustice, a crime, because I don't know

875
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,660
 what you don't see in me.

876
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,580
 I'm the perfect guy, and yet you throw yourselves

877
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,900
 at all these obnoxious men instead of me,

878
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,540
 the supreme gentlemen.

879
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,620
 They have all rejected me and looked down on me

880
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,740
 as an inferior man, if I have ever made

881
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,660
 a sexual advance toward them.

882
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,240
 While they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes,

883
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,820
 I am in truth the superior one, the true alpha male,

884
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,900
 said the Santa Barbara shooter in his last video,

885
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,540
 and the reason I read that to you is,

886
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,300
 you know, they're coming out and they're saying

887
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,980
 he had so many selfies and he was so focused on himself,

888
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,020
 and he had made all these YouTube videos in his BMW,

889
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,780
 and he was trying to build a kingdom here for himself,

890
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,300
 and it had led to a place that was really, really bad.

891
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,900
 I mean, that's what the prince of this air does,

892
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,680
 is he just, he comes, he has one message to you.

893
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,180
 He says, hey, if you eat it, you can be like God.

894
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,260
 Hey, if you do that, you can be like God.

895
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,620
 Hey, guess what, I can make you like a God.

896
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,940
 And so some of you are trying to be gods

897
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,580
 in your little world, whether that's work

898
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,100
 or your neighborhood or whatever that is.

899
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,220
 Like, your biggest dream, your biggest fantasy

900
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,700
 is to be like a God.

901
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,600
 That's the lie of the enemy.

902
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,220
 And so every quarter-life crisis I've ever seen

903
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,460
 was rooted in self-idolatry.

904
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,580
 Likewise, every sin I've ever examined

905
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,060
 was rooted in self-worship.

906
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,580
 But others have to see you.

907
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,180
 They have to see you pass the cross.

908
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,220
 They have to know what it is that you live for

909
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,740
 and why you have life and what you're doing here.

910
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,680
 And so if you think that this is everything

911
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,940
 that's great in your life,

912
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,460
 there's actually something greater than you

913
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,620
 that should be on it, that people should see.

914
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,440
 Something that you should point to.

915
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,220
 Something that you should show the world.

916
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,380
 And so if you're putting things on

917
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,740
 to let others know who you are and who you worship,

918
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,860
 let it be Jesus.

919
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,860
 But the problem, guys, is some of us,

920
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,820
 we've lived for ourselves for so long,

921
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,340
 we have walked into a trap.

922
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,220
 We've continued to point to ourselves

923
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,060
 and continued to try to show the world ourselves

924
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,700
 that we've got to a place where we can't get out of

925
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,820
 and we're stuck.

926
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,580
 And we're so focused on us,

927
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,020
 we can't point to anything.

928
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,940
 We've been hugging ourselves so much

929
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,420
 that we've walked into a prison that we can't get out of.

930
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,820
 We can't show anyone else love like this.

931
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,900
 We're the biggest thing in our world

932
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,500
 and so how can we share our mind and wonder

933
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,820
 what God would have us do and who God would have us love

934
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,340
 when we're tied up like this?

935
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,460
 Guys, I know this sounds crazy,

936
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,460
 but I know this, guys, I know this sin so well,

937
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,380
 I know this struggle so well.

938
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,820
 This was it for me, I know you guys have heard me

939
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,220
 talk about pornography a lot and lost a lot.

940
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,940
 Man, I just was a guy in my own prison

941
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,140
 the vast majority of my life.

942
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,780
 In high school, I desperately wanted to be the athlete

943
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
 and I just wasn't.

944
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,700
 I wasn't, okay, I never,

945
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,580
 I couldn't put the ball through the hoop, man,

946
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,420
 I couldn't throw a spiral.

947
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,660
 I can't, truth be told.

948
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,260
 And I would get in the car and I would just wonder

949
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,060
 what everyone would think of me.

950
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,660
 And I would go to bed and at night I would wonder

951
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,700
 what they would think of me and when relationships would end

952
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
 I would literally wanna jump off a building

953
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,540
 because they had become idols to me.

954
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,740
 And I would give myself to women

955
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,900
 and then I wouldn't know how to live without them.

956
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,220
 And then later that narcissism turned into abusing them

957
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,300
 through relationships, not physically but verbally

958
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
 and just being manipulative.

959
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,100
 And I realized I was in a prison.

960
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,300
 I was my favorite thing in the whole world.

961
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,180
 And I remember hearing the gospel message

962
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,580
 that I can't even save myself,

963
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,140
 there's nothing that I can do to get to God,

964
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,820
 that I have to trust in Christ.

965
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,660
 And I asked him, I knew I was sick, man,

966
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,300
 I knew I was sick, I knew there was something wrong with me.

967
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,700
 And I said, God, you gotta help me.

968
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,180
 You gotta set me free from this.

969
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,580
 And I began to take my thoughts captive

970
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,900
 and the first thing I did, and it's what I want you to do,

971
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,620
 is I just started wondering, I just started auditing

972
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,500
 how much I think about me.

973
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,580
 Like in the car, whenever I would think about me,

974
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,780
 I would begin, I just would like,

975
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,260
 man, what am I doing right now?

976
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,100
 And I would try to stop and I would try to deflect

977
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,940
 those thoughts to God and I would say this prayer,

978
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,580
 God, you become greater, make me less.

979
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,940
 Help me transition my thoughts, God.

980
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,900
 Help me to think about something else.

981
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,700
 The next thing I did is I began to realize

982
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,780
 that God did give me some gifts.

983
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,980
 And I realized that those gifts weren't for me,

984
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,580
 so I started to audit those gifts.

985
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,020
 God, what are the gifts that you entrusted to me

986
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,180
 and only me and how can I use them for your glory?

987
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,820
 How can I use those gifts to point to you?

988
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,500
 God, make me a sign.

989
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,380
 Make me a road sign, firmly planted on Christ

990
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,940
 so that I would point to him.

991
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,140
 Would you leverage the gifts and the talents

992
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,380
 and the resources and the people that I influence

993
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,500
 and would you help me point them to you?

994
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:42,500
 And I realized this, and this is huge.

995
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,500
 Galatians 1:10 says, am I now trying to win

996
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,580
 the approval of God or of men or am I trying to please men?

997
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,340
 For if I'm trying to please men,

998
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,380
 I would not be a bondservant of Christ.

999
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,740
 If I'm gonna be a slave to something,

1000
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,820
 I wanna be a slave to Jesus.

1001
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,860
 And so I realized this one really key truth

1002
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,860
 I wanna hit you with, that God's in charge

1003
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,260
 of what others think of you.

1004
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,140
 God is in charge of what others think of you.

1005
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,680
 God can give you favor with anyone

1006
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,280
 or he can remove it with anyone.

1007
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,340
 And so I just said, God, you're in charge

1008
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,440
 of what they think of me.

1009
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,720
 If you see it fit, I pray I'd have favor with them.

1010
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,460
 And if not, I understand, help me to trust you in that.

1011
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,100
 If they don't like me, help me to trust you.

1012
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,820
 But it doesn't go away, I mean, right?

1013
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,220
 I'll be done and somebody might come up here

1014
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,520
 and be tempted to say, man, JP, that was awesome.

1015
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,900
 And there are nights I leave this place

1016
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,140
 and I get in my truck and I'm driving home

1017
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,580
 and I'm like, yes, I'm awesome.

1018
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,700
 And it's sick.

1019
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,200
 Because I gotta say, God, you're awesome.

1020
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,340
 God, you're awesome.

1021
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,140
 I pray that they would see you past me.

1022
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,900
 And so in summary, do you believe you have nothing

1023
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,300
 that you haven't been given?

1024
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,800
 How have you been stealing God's glory?

1025
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,280
 And how will you leave here

1026
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,860
 and use your life to point to him?

1027
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,540
 I don't know if you guys know where the word narcissist

1028
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,440
 or narcissism comes from, but the Greek God,

1029
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,320
 the Greeks were brilliant.

1030
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,900
 Think of whatever you want about them,

1031
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,120
 but they were some brilliant people

1032
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,340
 and their stories have real life lessons.

1033
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,380
 And so Narcissus was a God who was really gifted.

1034
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,860
 He was a great hunter, he was a great athlete.

1035
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,540
 And a nymph fell in love with him.

1036
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,220
 I know that's weird, but she did.

1037
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,220
 And he didn't reciprocate those feelings

1038
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,860
 and so she casted a spell on him

1039
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,740
 so that whenever he would look at his reflection,

1040
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,040
 he fell in love with it.

1041
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,500
 And so he actually had the first selfie.

1042
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,100
 He looked in the water and saw a picture of himself

1043
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,620
 and fell in love with it.

1044
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,600
 And so whenever he would reach out to hug himself,

1045
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,280
 the image would disappear in the water.

1046
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,820
 And so he died of starvation in love with himself.

1047
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,800
 He died of depression in love with himself

1048
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,860
 because he couldn't actually reach himself.

1049
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,340
 He couldn't actually reciprocate that love.

1050
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,900
 And so I wanna come back here and show you what it is.

1051
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,500
 I know I ripped this thing,

1052
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,120
 so it's evidently for a smaller crazy person.

1053
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,540
 (congregation laughing)

1054
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,420
 But as we come back here, our life,

1055
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:21,900
 the picture that everything displays,

1056
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,660
 that the world sees, should be us pointing to this

1057
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,860
 and saying, "Hey, do you see this?"

1058
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,260
 Like you've got to see this, you've got to know this one.

1059
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,860
 And for some of us, it's like we become so big in our lives.

1060
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,180
 We become so big that we block the cross,

1061
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,620
 that no one can see Jesus past us.

1062
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,180
 And we, if we were really honest,

1063
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,500
 we don't even want them to.

1064
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,340
 We just want them to see us.

1065
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,740
 And John the Baptist's message is perfect.

1066
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,220
 He says, "Hey, I want you to turn

1067
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,040
 "from you living your life for you.

1068
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,820
 "I want you to realize that God saved you

1069
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,560
 "through Jesus Christ, that all your sins went on Him.

1070
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,580
 "All your sins went on this thing.

1071
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,700
 "Your narcissism, it went on this thing.

1072
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,300
 "It was nailed to it."

1073
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,040
 And that Jesus goes in the grave,

1074
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,460
 and He came out without them.

1075
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,440
 And so may you spend the rest of your days,

1076
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,100
 as you repent, as you turn from your sins

1077
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,600
 and turn to Christ, would you spend the rest of your days

1078
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,860
 worshiping Him, being made new,

1079
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,140
 that you no longer live the life you live

1080
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,620
 in the flesh, you no longer live,

1081
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,740
 but now you live by the Spirit of Christ who lives in you,

1082
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,820
 and you walk in Him.

1083
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,920
 You depend fully on Him with everything you can.

1084
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,900
 You become a sign pointing to this guy.

1085
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,360
 Let me pray that we would.

1086
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:55,900
 Father, we love you.

1087
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,700
 Help us to live for you.

1088
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,500
 God, help us to know everything that you've done

1089
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,580
 in and for us through Jesus.

1090
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,100
 Pray that we would become less,

1091
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,300
 and that you would become more,

1092
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,740
 that we would decrease, and that you would increase.

1093
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,700
 That we would not run up and plead for attention,

1094
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,560
 but we would deflect attention.

1095
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,940
 As the moon reflects the light of the sun, God,

1096
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,420
 that we would reflect glory to you, God.

1097
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,820
 Thank you for all that you have done,

1098
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,500
 just even to have us here, that we could worship you

1099
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,400
 and sing love songs to you, Lord.

1100
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,780
 I pray that you would stir our hearts for you now, God.

1101
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,500
 Help us to love you more than us.

1102
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,860
 Father, forgive us where we failed in that.

1103
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,980
 We love you, King Jesus.

1104
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,700
 It's in Christ's name, amen.

1105
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,540
 Amen.

1106
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,100
 Man, I know, like I was single here, you know that.

1107
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,580
 I mean, if we've been hanging out long together,

1108
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,740
 you know that.

1109
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,180
 I was a single dude in Dallas.

1110
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,860
 It's got like this crazy message.

1111
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,820
 The gospel's different in Dallas.

1112
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,900
 Like the good news in Dallas is like, man,

1113
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,820
 you can be a king.

1114
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,020
 You can be the rich, young ruler.

1115
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,580
 You can have lots of stuff and keep it forever.

1116
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,740
 Man, that's such a lie.

1117
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,580
 You can have lots of stuff and keep it

1118
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,380
 for a tiny little while.

1119
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,940
 Or you can take everything that you have

1120
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,820
 and you can store up these treasures in heaven

1121
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,500
 where you get to be with God and enjoy them forever

1122
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,780
 and just sit up there with him and watch the replay.

1123
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,860
 Say, man, did you see that?

1124
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,700
 Watch that.

1125
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,820
 Not because you're trying to earn something from God,

1126
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,620
 but because you've been given everything in him.

1127
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,460
 There's a God.

1128
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,180
 I'm certain of it.

1129
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,940
 I've given my life to that truth.

1130
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,140
 He's the Christian God.

1131
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,980
 I'm positive.

1132
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,820
 I've researched it.

1133
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,740
 Jesus is real.

1134
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,540
 He really lived and he really died.

1135
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,180
 And he really came back from the grave.

1136
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,740
 It says over 500 people saw him.

1137
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,020
 And the reason he did it is because we're sinners.

1138
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,740
 We can't even save ourselves.

1139
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,140
 Hear me clearly.

1140
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,740
 A life lived for you is a life wasted.

1141
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:18,500
 A life lived for you is a life wasted.

1142
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,100
 And it will cause something much worse

1143
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,700
 than a quarter life crisis.

1144
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,460
 It will cause an eternal life crisis.

1145
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,100
 I pray that you would know the one

1146
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,700
 who came so that you might have life

1147
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,660
 and have it to the full.

1148
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,340
 If we can talk to you about him, we'd love to.

1149
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,340
 There'll be an entire team of folks up here

1150
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,660
 ready to have a conversation with you.

1151
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,860
 I hope you guys, as you leave,

1152
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,620
 that you would leave with a heart to change Dallas

1153
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,980
 and to grab the attention of Dallas and turn it to Jesus.

1154
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,980
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

1155
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,140
 (silence)

1156
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,300
 (silence)

1157
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,460
