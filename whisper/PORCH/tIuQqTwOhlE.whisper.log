[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:19.720]   Good evening.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.760]   Oh, man, it's going to be a long night.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.080]   We have any dog lovers here?
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.400]   Come on, man.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.320]   Big representative.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.200]   Any cat lovers?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.600]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   All right, we'll pray for you.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880]   It felt like y'all sat together.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   Did y'all meet here, like all the cat lovers have a big sign?
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.360]   You probably saw a blue and black dress, too.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360]   I get it, man.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520]   Glad you're here.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.160]   I had two dogs growing up, not at the same time,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.160]   but as I reflect back on my childhood,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   I think about these two dogs that we
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.240]   had at different seasons growing up, one and then the other.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.480]   Their names were Zach and Max.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   And Zach was a black lab.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   I bought him from my uncle for a nickel.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320]   And it's true what they say, man's best friend, right?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.520]   And so just as a kid, this black lab was so good.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.000]   And we would like taught him tricks.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.600]   He could sit, and he could actually--
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   we had this tree in our backyard he could climb.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.000]   True story for you cat lovers.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.240]   My dog could climb a tree.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.200]   And so he was a good dog, except one thing.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.520]   There was one command that he didn't learn,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.040]   and that was stay here.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.400]   I grew up on 20 acres on the Guadalupe River,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160]   on the farm, in the country.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.120]   It was puppy paradise, right?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.240]   And all he needed to do-- we fed him, and we were good to him.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.680]   All he needed to do was stay on the farm,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.640]   except for he would constantly wander.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.440]   Like he would go on the neighbor's property,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.160]   and he would just wander all throughout this kind of area
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   that we lived in.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.360]   And there was a highway near there.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.960]   I was always afraid he was going to get hit by a semi truck.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.760]   And so he would just-- he would constantly wander off.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.680]   And I'd be like, Zach, you've got to come home.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.200]   Come home.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.720]   Stay home.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.240]   Stay here.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.560]   I would walk him around the perimeter of the house.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.960]   I'm like, don't cross the barbed wire fence.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.840]   You've got to stay on our property.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.680]   And we would call him, and he would eventually come back.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.560]   When he would hear, we'd honk the horn.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.440]   And he would eventually come back.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.680]   But he would always wander off.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   It was like he wasn't satisfied with us being his master.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   Even though we gave him good things,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.880]   he was always looking for something else.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.320]   And one day, we couldn't find him.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.800]   One day, we honked the horn, and he didn't come home.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   And so we went out looking for him.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.280]   And we found him.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   He had been shot.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.440]   It's gangster inquiry, man.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.720]   You've got to-- it's just the way they do.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.000]   Somebody shot my dog.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   OK?
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.640]   And if you're here, I want-- no.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   And so it was just this crazy thing.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.280]   And I think about that, and it's like, man,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.040]   if he would have just stayed on the farm like I told him to.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.440]   I wanted to give him good things,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.480]   but he constantly wandered off.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.520]   And we found him, and he was dead.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.720]   And then we got this other dog, Max, to replace him.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.040]   Max was a lab Rottweiler cross, and also a great dog.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.160]   Taught him incredible tricks, and he obeyed.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.680]   And Max was completely content on the farm.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.920]   In fact, he never would cross the property line.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.400]   It was like God knew what we needed.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.720]   And he was a great dog.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.080]   And one day, we took him hunting to this other property
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.760]   that we had, where we had some cows, some cattle.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.800]   And it was about seven miles away
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.200]   on the other side of the river.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.240]   And my dad pulled out a rifle and shot the rifle.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.040]   He was sighting it in.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   If you're a hunter, you know what that means.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.840]   And he shot the rifle.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.440]   Well, Max, our dog, had never heard a rifle.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.000]   And he hears that gun, and he just takes off and keeps going.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.760]   Like Forrest Gump style, keeps going and going.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I'm like, come back, Max.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.000]   Hey, come-- OK, funny joke.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.520]   Come-- and he just disappears in the tree line.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.560]   And I'm like, what?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.440]   And so we looked for him for hours
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.240]   until the sun set, went home, went to school the next day,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.920]   went back out there, drove back seven miles away
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.600]   to that little farmland where we had cattle, looked for him,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   started knocking on neighbors' doors,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.000]   like just going up and showing them, have you seen my dog?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   They're like, yeah, I saw him walking around.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   And I was like putting the story together.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.640]   Well, what date, when did you see him, what time?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.240]   Have you seen him?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.960]   Yeah, we saw him.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.160]   We were wondering who's dog it was.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.720]   Thought it was a stray.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.440]   It's not a stray.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.760]   It's my dog.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.440]   Where is he?
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.120]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   He wandered off.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.600]   And so we did that for six days.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.840]   We looked for him.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.520]   Six days, we drove out there seven miles away,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.640]   the other side of the river.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.880]   And on the sixth day of doing this,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.800]   every single day after school, we come back home.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.080]   We get back to my house.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.920]   And there he is sitting in the driveway.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.880]   He had traveled-- homeward bound, man.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.340]   He had traveled seven miles and swam the river.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.680]   He was all wet.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.000]   He had swam the river to get back on the property.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   He did whatever it took to come back to his master.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.360]   And I tell you that tonight because the church in Colossae,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.160]   the church that Paul is writing to, the Colossians,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   they have strayed away from home.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.400]   They have been distracted.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.560]   They've been looking for another master.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   They've been looking for Jesus plus something else.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.800]   There's got to be another way.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.000]   Is there any other philosophy out there?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.360]   Is there anything else that we can achieve this higher
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.920]   learning?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.000]   Is there some other idea?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And they've wandered off.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.600]   And Paul, in this letter, is calling them home.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.360]   He's saying, come home.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680]   Come back to your one true master, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.320]   And I say that to you tonight because every one of us
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.720]   is like one of those dogs, a Zachary Max.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.880]   We're wandering through Dallas or Fort Worth.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.600]   And we're looking in bars and in clubs.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   We're looking in stores and in malls.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.240]   We're looking at jobs and in schools.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.880]   And we're trying to find some master that's going to satisfy.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.040]   We're dating guys.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.280]   We're looking on Tinder.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.680]   We're looking different places, hoping
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.720]   to find some master whom we can come under.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.880]   And they're going to take care of us.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.920]   They're going to feed us.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.960]   They're going to fill this void in our lives and satisfy us.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.240]   And God, through this letter, is saying, come home.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.720]   Will you return back to the one true master, the one whom
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   I'm sent into your world to call you home?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.560]   The one who died for you.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.880]   The one who defeated death.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.640]   We celebrated this past Sunday on Easter for you.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's a perfect master.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Perfect master.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.880]   That's an incredible master.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.240]   And so he's saying, hey, let's go back to the basics.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.120]   In Colossians chapter 2, if you have your Bibles,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   you can turn there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.360]   1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.600]   and the book of Colossians.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.200]   Colossians chapter 2.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.600]   In verse 6, he says, David said last week,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.400]   I caught on this, so then just as you receive Christ Jesus
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.960]   as Lord, continue to live your lives in him.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.560]   He says, grow in Christ the same way you came to him.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.200]   Through dependence, we say at the porch often,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.280]   all you need is need.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.720]   If you're here, you're a visitor with us,
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.080]   and you're wondering, hey, what do I need to be a Christian?
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.840]   You need need.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.520]   You need to be in a place where you know you're a sinner
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.600]   and you need a savior.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   You need someone other than you, a perfect God,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.720]   to save you from your sins.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.120]   All you need is need.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.240]   You grow in Christ the same way you came to him.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.680]   If you're here and you're a mature believer,
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   you know the scriptures, you've been in church
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.800]   for a long time, you love Jesus, what do you need?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.120]   You need need as well.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.520]   You need to wake up and realize that you're desperate
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   for the gospel because you're a sinner.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.680]   And though while God made you a saint through Christ,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.440]   prone to wonder, Lord, I feel it,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.880]   prone to leave the God I love.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.960]   Call me home through the gospel.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.160]   And so tonight we're gonna talk about what it looks like
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.120]   to be rooted in Jesus, to be tied up.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.400]   Like sometimes we'd have to tie Zach up
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.440]   so that he wouldn't wonder, to be tied to Jesus,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.000]   rooted deeply in Jesus with Christ as the foundation.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.640]   We're gonna look at what it looks like,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.280]   how Jesus, in Jesus, our stance is strengthened,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.920]   how in Jesus our searching is satisfied,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.840]   and how in Jesus our sin nature is severed.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.920]   Colossians chapter two, starting in verse seven.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.880]   At the end of six he says,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.640]   "Continue to live your lives in him, Jesus,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.780]   "rooted and built up in him, Jesus,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.640]   "strengthened in the faith you were taught
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.680]   "and overflowing with thankfulness."
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.920]   Rooted in Jesus, rooted in Christ.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.840]   "See to it that no one takes you captive
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.200]   "through hollow and deceptive philosophies,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.660]   "which depends on human tradition
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.820]   "and elemental spiritual forces of this world
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.880]   "rather than on Christ."
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   See to it that no one takes you captive with worldly ideas.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.640]   I just got back last week, I was on,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.960]   it was in Austin, Greg and I went down to UT
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.280]   and we were doing evangelism on the campus
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.760]   and then we'd preach a message that night
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.120]   and there'd be worship, it was like a porch gathering.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.280]   They're on the campus outside.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.720]   And as we would engage with people who would walk by,
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.680]   if you know anything about UT, very liberal campus.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.960]   And as we would engage with people,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.520]   they were fine with Jesus.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.440]   Yeah, Jesus, that's neat.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.720]   But then they would come
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.240]   with some superior worldly knowledge.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.480]   It was interesting to me how confident they were.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.680]   Like there I am, like hey, I'd love to talk to you
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.520]   about God.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.120]   It's like, well, you can't possibly know God.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's like, well, you can't possibly know who I know.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.360]   You know, it's like, hey, let's talk about that, right?
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.480]   And he's like, you know, no, I'm great with Jesus,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.840]   but I mean, you can't tell me he's the only way.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.880]   He said he was the only way.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.520]   The Jesus that you're fine with, you know,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.760]   said I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.380]   No one gets to the Father except through me.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.960]   I am the gate.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.280]   Wide is the road that leads to destruction,
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   narrow is the gate that leads to life,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.640]   and few will find.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.040]   You know, he said these words, right?
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   The one whom you're fine with, you know,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.920]   it's written and read in a historical book
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.600]   that talks about his life.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.560]   A biography of him says that he said that.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.760]   Are you okay with that?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.440]   And they would come with these worldly concepts.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.200]   You know, they had been taught by some professor
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.140]   some superior worldly wisdom.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.480]   That's what's going on in Colossae here.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.160]   We don't know exactly what, but it is apparent
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.640]   that they have been led astray by some heresy.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.760]   Somebody has added something to Jesus.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.800]   Okay, probably some form of work,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.060]   and we believe some sort of angelic worship
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.360]   or worship of angels is going on.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.780]   And so Paul is calling them home.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.240]   You know what he's saying?
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.740]   He's like, hey, let's go back to the basics.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.900]   That's what everyone tonight needs to hear.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.640]   By calling you home, I'm saying, hey,
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   can we just return to the fundamental gospel, the basics?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.920]   I was raised Catholic, Catholic school for nine years.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   My wife, who I met in college
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.520]   when I was not walking with the Lord,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.680]   was raised in the Church of Christian Science.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.120]   And so we both had Jesus and some other ideas
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.760]   that we had been taught along the way.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.680]   And we would argue, you know, our relationship as we dated,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.160]   as pagans, would look like, you know,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.200]   hey, our kids are gonna be Catholic.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.440]   No, they're gonna be Church of Christian Science.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.360]   No, that's crazy.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.960]   You're not gonna be that, you know,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.920]   wacko, be Catholic.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.320]   And so that's what, it was healthy, you know?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   And so we would have those arguments.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.800]   And one day, if you've been here long,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.240]   you've heard my story, I stumbled into this place,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   to Watermark, hung over, sat in the back row,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.600]   I heard the gospel, and began to search for God
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.000]   and kept coming to Christ.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.960]   And that led to a conversation in my car with Monica,
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.120]   who I was dating at the time,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.000]   and I just said, hey, what do you believe?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.680]   And in a moment of God's grace,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.820]   we kind of put down our swords and just said,
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.660]   you know what?
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.320]   She goes, I remember it, and we talk about this often.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   She said, I believe in Jesus.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.000]   I believe that God sent him to die for my sins
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.240]   and that God raised him from the dead.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   And I looked at her and I said, that's what I believe.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.800]   And I said, right now, that's all I'm sure about.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.040]   Let's build on that.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.400]   And we just began, we started going to church together,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.120]   and we trusted in Christ together.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.320]   It's interesting.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.640]   And we grew in that reality.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.200]   We said, let's just go back to the basics,
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.160]   the fundamental gospel.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.680]   If I get distracted by a bunch of theology
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.540]   or a bunch of competing views,
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.440]   or what does it look like, you know, this or that,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.520]   or soteriology or end times
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.760]   or whatever is distracting me at the time,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.060]   sometimes I just gotta go back to the gospel.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.920]   For God so loved the world
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.960]   that he gave his only begotten son
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.260]   that whoever believes in him shall not perish,
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.920]   but have eternal life.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.000]   So my first point this evening from this text
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.240]   is Jesus strengthens our stance.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.680]   Jesus strengthens our stance.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.400]   Jesus is the foundation of your faith.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.680]   Now, if you've done any kind of athletic sports,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.040]   like in football, okay, they would say, widen your stance.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.000]   You get a three-point stance, widen your base.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.920]   Cheerleading, same thing.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.760]   Basketball, you come down with a rebound,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.580]   widen your stance.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.280]   Karate, I can remember in martial arts,
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.620]   they say, hey, widen your stance
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.040]   so that you're not easily knocked over.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.660]   Widen your base.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.380]   Jesus strengthens your stance
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.320]   so that the forces of this world don't take you captive.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.220]   You go back to Christ
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.100]   so that you're not distracted by the bar,
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.760]   by that girl on Tinder,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.020]   by your job, by your desire for money,
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.800]   your desire for clothes, your desire for style, whatever.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.120]   He strengthens your stance, widen your base,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.180]   focus on the foundation.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.040]   Jesus strengthens your stance.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.400]   In Matthew 7, he says, you wanna be like a house
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.460]   built on a solid foundation
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.280]   of which Jesus is that foundation.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.700]   Verse 25, he says, the rain came down
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.760]   and the streams rose and the winds blew
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.960]   and beat against that house,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.800]   yet it did not fall because it was built on the rock.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.360]   This scripture says rooted
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.840]   is the word it uses, like Psalm 1.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.680]   It says, blessed is the man who delights
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.720]   in the law of the Lord.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.480]   He or she is like a tree
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.180]   planted by streams of water
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.460]   with deep roots that go deep into the ground to hold it.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.700]   The hurricane comes and the tree's not going anywhere.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.100]   The storms of this life blow,
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.580]   but the tree stands firm
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.880]   because its roots are deep into the ground
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.300]   reaching for the source of life.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.100]   Yields fruit in and out of season
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.260]   that you would be rooted in Christ.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.940]   And then he says built up.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.460]   Monica and I, our family just built a home.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.140]   We moved into it on Thanksgiving.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.200]   It was about a 13, 14 month process.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.020]   And so many of those months were spent
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.300]   before anything ever went up.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.860]   In fact, I took our team over there
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.860]   and we prayed just over the foundation of the house
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.740]   because it took months and months and months
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.900]   just to build the foundation.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.300]   They took so much care into digging these deep holes
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.500]   and grooves in the ground
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.580]   and drilling deep into the bedrock
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.980]   and then putting these things in there called piers.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.260]   And then on top of those piers
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.220]   being this building this concrete slab
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.020]   and in this slab was rebar and these steel beams
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.180]   to hold it together.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.400]   There's the foundation, why?
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.740]   Because before this builder put anything up
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.100]   they wanted to make sure that it would stay,
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.100]   that it would hold true.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.540]   And so before you go grabbing for theology
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.140]   and memory verses and learning the Bible
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.740]   you make sure you have the gospel,
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.340]   Christ at your foundation.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.900]   He says or else when the winds blow it will crumble.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   It will fall down.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.780]   He says strengthened in the faith,
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.140]   I'm sorry, strengthened in the faith as you were taught.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.140]   Strengthened in the faith as you were taught.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.460]   Back to the basics.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.460]   I hear this question a lot, every so often.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.020]   Does the porch exist to reach non-believers,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.900]   non-Christians to evangelize, to seek?
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.340]   Or does the porch exist to equip Christians, believers,
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.460]   to build in important to Christians?
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.220]   And the answer is, I wanna answer it for you
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.300]   so that you can answer it for others.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.620]   The answer is yes.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.100]   Okay?
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.960]   The porch exists to reach sinners.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.700]   So the only people that should be in this room
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.140]   right now are sinners.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.460]   If you're here and you're not a sinner, feel free to leave.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.420]   You know, we may follow you frankly.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.860]   All right, the only people here are sinners.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.220]   We exist to reach sinners.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.420]   Now who are sinners, right?
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.740]   If you're here and you have trusted in Christ
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.140]   and you've grown in the knowledge of the scriptures
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.100]   and you're seeking him, you desperately need the gospel
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.140]   to be reminded of the basics
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.540]   so that you don't turn to some religious acts
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.940]   or whatever you do for your own salvation,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.380]   thinking that God loves you more
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.700]   because of the things you do.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.820]   That flies in the face of the gospel.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.540]   And so that you don't become self-righteous and legalistic,
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.500]   you on a regular basis, on a daily basis,
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.780]   must be reminded that God saved you
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.520]   in spite of you through Christ and the return to him.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.940]   Now, if we brought you in off the corner
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.900]   where you were selling crack or selling yourself
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.500]   or anything else for that matter,
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.940]   and you don't know Christ and you're an atheist
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.580]   and you've rejected that or whatever,
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.180]   and I'm coming up with sins that for some reason
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.280]   we think are greater than our own
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.420]   because our theology's whack at times,
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.340]   but if you're here and you don't know God,
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.940]   you desperately need the gospel.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.600]   So believing people who sin, saints who sin,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.740]   and sinners both desperately need the gospel
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.660]   of which I hope we hold in front of you on a weekly basis
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.260]   so that you will be strengthened in the faith
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.360]   as you were taught.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.000]   Ephesians 4, verse 13 and 14,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.940]   it's almost a commentary on this passage
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.260]   or I'll say a summary of this passage, says this.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.900]   Until we reach unity in the faith
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.300]   and become mature, attaining to the whole measure
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.000]   of the fullness of Christ,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.580]   then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.380]   by the waves and blown here and there
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.440]   by every wind of teaching and by the cunning
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.840]   and craftiness of people in their deceitful schemings.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.340]   Once we are mature in the fullness of Christ,
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.700]   we will no longer be taken captive
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.900]   by the schemings of this world.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.440]   Some of you, you're here, you've been taken captive.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.420]   You're sitting there as a slave.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.740]   You've been taken captive by Dallas or Fort Worth
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.580]   or whatever is going on in your world.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.180]   This scripture calls us to be overflowing
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.140]   with thankfulness.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.100]   Listen, you can't leave here and try to be thankful.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.660]   That will not work.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.740]   But you reflect on the fact that God saved you
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.660]   in spite of you and he promises you eternal life himself,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.740]   that he literally died for all the terrible things
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   that you've done, that he said,
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.140]   "Hey, you don't have to pay for them.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.660]   "I paid for them."
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.420]   And so now there's no condemnation
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.780]   for those who are in Jesus
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.060]   and you will not help but be thankful.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.740]   When you reflect and renew your mind around the gospel
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.820]   that God saved you through Christ,
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.020]   his death and resurrection as a payment for your sins,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.140]   you will be thankful.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.080]   But we're not thankful because at some point, I think,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.520]   we've began to think that Jesus
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.800]   and the paradise he offers is not enough.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.240]   And you came in here and it's just like old news,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.840]   like, "Oh yeah, yeah, Jesus, and I get to be with God
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.720]   "forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.000]   "and that's all good, but I want that
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.080]   "and a husband who's a doctor."
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.120]   And it's just like Jesus is not enough.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.680]   Or you came in here and you don't see yourself as a sinner.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.280]   And when I say sinner, I don't mean murderer
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.480]   or something that you've put in a special category.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.900]   I mean you.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.880]   I mean the things you did today.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.740]   I mean the thoughts you've had in the past 30 seconds.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:42.740]   How you lust, how you get angry, how you covet,
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.640]   how you're envious and jealous.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.120]   You need a savior.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.440]   Grateful, God gave you one, Jesus.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.640]   Verse nine, "For in Christ, all the fullness of the deity
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.440]   "lives in bodily form, and in Christ,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.520]   "you have been brought to fullness.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.680]   "He is the head over every power and authority."
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   My second point is that Jesus satisfies our searching.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.000]   In this passage right here, you see this word fullness
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.200]   over and over and over.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.520]   So Jesus satisfies our searching.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.280]   Jesus makes us full.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.120]   Why?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.400]   Because Jesus is, starting with this idea in this passage,
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.240]   fully God.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.800]   That's Colossians 2, verse nine.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.040]   Do you remember that convo I had with you
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.240]   a couple weeks ago about a convo I had
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.720]   with someone who was near and dear to me
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.080]   who denied that Jesus was God.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.000]   They said, "Hey, I'm great with Jesus being the son of God.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.360]   "I just don't think he was God."
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   I took them to this passage.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.160]   Look at Colossians 2, nine.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.080]   Now I could've went John one, in the beginning was the word,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.600]   and the word was with God, and the word was God.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.480]   I could've went anyone who's seen me has seen the Father,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.400]   I and the Father are one.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.120]   A lot of different places in the scriptures,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.000]   but I went right here 'cause I think it's the clearest.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.440]   Colossians 2, nine.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.920]   That, "For in Christ, all the fullness of the deity
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.680]   "lives in bodily form."
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.400]   When I stumbled into this place,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.280]   I began looking for God with a bias against Christianity.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:13.120]   When I came to a place where I knew there was a God,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.300]   and I realized that I needed to change my life,
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.600]   I began looking for God.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.440]   I was agnostic.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.560]   I didn't know who he was, but I knew that there was a creator.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.920]   And as I began to look for him, I thought,
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.960]   "What are the odds that he be the Christian God?"
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.560]   'Cause I was born in America,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.640]   and if I was born in India, I'd be Hindu.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.380]   If I was born in China, I'd be Buddhist.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.220]   If I was born in Iran, I'd be Muslim.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.280]   If I was born in Israel, I'd be Jewish.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.540]   And not to even mention the cults of the world.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.120]   And so what are the odds I'd be born into the right place,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.320]   worshiping the right God?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.200]   So I began to look for him in the Quran.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   I began to look for him through the teachings
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.460]   of Eastern philosophy.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.120]   I began to look for him in the other places,
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.660]   and I kept tripping over Jesus.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.200]   I kept tripping over this man
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.360]   who reset the calendar 2015 years ago.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.400]   I kept tripping over this man
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.560]   whose book is the bestseller year after year after year,
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.960]   and in the history of the world,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.320]   by a margin of about a billion copies.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.880]   There's something significant
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.680]   with this single most undisputed, undeniable,
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.900]   single most polarizing, most notorious character
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.820]   in the history of history, Jesus Christ.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.800]   I said, I gotta deal with Jesus.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.480]   The only reason you know about Jesus
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.240]   is because he is God.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.460]   Because he is God.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.920]   That's the only reason you know about Christ.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.240]   There was a lot of people,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.520]   Jesus was born in the armpit of the Roman Empire, okay?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.920]   You should not know him.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   He was a carpenter.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   He was a nobody, except he was God.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.760]   He was born in a time when a lot of people raised up
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.560]   and said that, hey, I'm a Messiah.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.480]   No, I'm a Messiah.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.400]   No, I'm the Messiah.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.960]   No, I'm the Messiah.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   And Jesus showed up and said, no, I am.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.040]   Chumps, no, he didn't say that.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.880]   He should have.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.700]   He should have.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.060]   He shows up, he says, I am,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.080]   and he becomes the single most polarizing,
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.160]   most famous, most notorious, most infamous character
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.760]   in the history of history.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.600]   Why?
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.420]   Because he was God.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.880]   And why is this relevant?
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   Because this text says that Jesus has full access to God,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.720]   and therefore you have full access to Christ,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.840]   and therefore you have full access to God.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.200]   I wrote it down like this.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.440]   Jesus has all of God, and you have all of Jesus,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.540]   and so in Jesus, you have all of God.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:41.560]   Jesus has all of God, and you have all of Jesus,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.500]   and so in Jesus, you have all of God.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   In Christ, it says you have been brought to fullness.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.120]   Some people are like, man, I'm cool with Jesus.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.520]   You can't be cool with Jesus.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.080]   If Jesus was here, you would be brought
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.320]   to one of two conclusions.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.760]   He is crazy.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.240]   He's walking around saying he's God,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.060]   or he's God, I'll worship him.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.560]   But you ain't cool with Jesus.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.540]   No one would be cool with Jesus.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.700]   You would be moved to worship,
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.400]   or you would call the sand asylum.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   But you wouldn't be cool with him.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.160]   And so it says in him, you have been brought to fullness.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.100]   What does this mean?
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.200]   Why does this matter?
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.340]   Anybody seen "Interstellar"?
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.600]   It's a great movie.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.400]   My friend Garrett's favorite movie, shout out Fort Worth.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.620]   And you don't have to see it for this to make sense,
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.760]   but it just talks about a black hole,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.040]   and so maybe you remember in science class, black holes,
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   like this huge vacuum that just sucks up mass
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.400]   and matter, it just swallows anything
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.020]   that tries to go into it.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.660]   Well, the scriptures says essentially
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.880]   that you have a black hole in your heart,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.560]   that he set eternity in your heart,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.700]   and that it is like this vacuum searching for significance
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.520]   as you go through your life,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.440]   as you travel through your city,
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.820]   you're looking for something to fill this black hole,
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.520]   but the problem is it just swallows it.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.400]   It's just a vacuum.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.320]   Nothing can fill it except for Christ.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   And so you're moving and you're searching for money
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.720]   and a job and an education and a boyfriend
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.880]   and a girlfriend or whatever, a new car,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.440]   hoping that something's gonna fill it, and it won't.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.840]   You buy a brand new car, and the next day it's an old car.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.600]   It's just like, man, I thought it was gonna complete me,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.560]   Jerry Maguire style, and it didn't,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.360]   and I'm left wanting.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.840]   And so here's why this matters, because who are you?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.640]   Like you came in here tonight, what is your identity in?
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.320]   Like you think about all the things that make you you,
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.380]   your style, right?
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.240]   All the things that make you you,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.680]   what you drive, yellow Xterra, sorority girl.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.560]   Only you, bro.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.120]   Where you live, your friend group.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.060]   What makes you you, what you make, your education?
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.120]   What makes you you, where it's from, your education's from,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.360]   where you went to school, is that a big part of your life?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.840]   Is there identity in that?
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.800]   Whoop.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.720]   (congregation applauding)
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.440]   What you like, what you do for fun,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   is that what makes you you?
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.000]   All those things, that's what makes you you?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.840]   Uh-uh.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.480]   You're God's.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.000]   You belong to him, that's what makes you you.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   It's not who you are, but whose you are.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.480]   You're his son or his daughter, just like my dog, Zach,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.640]   walking around looking for another master.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   He needed to look no further past his collar.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.720]   It said not only his name, but his owner's name.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.200]   That's whose he was, that's who he belonged to.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.440]   That's the farm that he lived on.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.320]   Even when he wandered off of it, that's where he belonged.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.520]   And likewise, you belong to God.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.160]   You can wander in and out of bars, you can run up bar tabs,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.920]   you can keep pursuing your sin
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.240]   or trying to find self-righteousness
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.880]   or the search for significance in a significant other,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.260]   but he's who you belong to.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.060]   You're his.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.940]   You're God's.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.340]   And so who you are, your identity is you're forgiven.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.220]   You're free.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.980]   You're redeemed, you're new, you're blameless,
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.620]   you're righteous, you're faultless,
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.540]   you're clean, you're complete, you're his child,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.660]   the creator of the heavens and the earth says you're mine.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.740]   Let me tell you why this is relevant,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.140]   because personally, I'm just gonna tell you
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.420]   about two people, I told you about two dogs,
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.100]   now let's talk about two people.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.060]   Person one, they have everything, okay?
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.540]   They've got the nicest car.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.780]   They live in the neighborhood that everyone wants to live in.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.220]   They make a lot of money, it comes in faster
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.540]   than they can spend it, right?
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.380]   They have style, right?
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.380]   They have, they're pretty, they're cute, they're handsome.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.120]   They've got it going on, they walk into the place
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.080]   and everybody looks at them and it just seems
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.020]   like they have life all figured out.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.860]   They are who so many of you want to be.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.020]   And then there's person number two,
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.640]   who doesn't have any of that,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.780]   but he has the one thing that fully satisfies,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.420]   he walks in an abiding relationship with Christ
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.500]   and he's good.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.300]   And I'm telling you, person number two
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.660]   is infinitely better off than person number one.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.060]   There are a ton of depressed billionaires in the world,
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.360]   people who have what you think that you want,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.200]   but they're not satisfied.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.420]   But have you ever seen someone who just walks blameless
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.280]   before the Lord, he says, hey, that is my God
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.420]   and I am his son, I am his daughter, and they're just fine.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.180]   People ridicule them, people mock them,
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.920]   they don't get the promotion and they're just fine.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.780]   Have you ever met this person?
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.120]   They are infinitely wealthy.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.540]   They have glorious riches, the scripture says.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.280]   I know people like this.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.500]   I was with my buddy yesterday, day before yesterday,
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.940]   bought a car, he bought a $2,300 car
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.120]   to replace his 1995 automobile
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.600]   with hundreds of thousands of miles
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.100]   because it was unsafe for his family to ride in.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.140]   So he saved up $2,300 and he went and he paid cash
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.080]   for a car and he was so excited on the way home.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.540]   He's just complete and Christ is just happy
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.340]   and he calls me today and he goes, how's the car?
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.180]   He's like, I love it.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.860]   He said the radio went out.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.460]   He goes, but I'm so thankful 'cause I think God
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.300]   just wants me to pray as I'm driving.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.460]   I'm like, he celebrated that his radio didn't work.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.100]   Like some of us would be throwing the radio
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.780]   through the window, you know, like what, this lemon.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.280]   If you see it, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.240]   But some of us were held captive to the world right now,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.520]   wanting the things of the world desperate for them
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.400]   and we'll never experience that fullness,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   we'll never experience that joy, that completeness,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.760]   that contentment that Christ offers
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.000]   because while we have some version of him,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.680]   we don't have his fullness.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.920]   We haven't surrendered to him fully.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.320]   My friend, Ephesians 4:13 says, he has become mature,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.840]   attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.800]   Don't you want that?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.720]   Verse 11, in him you were also circumcised
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.880]   with a circumcision not performed by human hands.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.900]   Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.980]   when you were circumcised by Christ.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.240]   What?
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.160]   Just got weird.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.800]   My third and final point is Jesus severs our sin nature.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.960]   I'm nervous up here, I'm like circumcision.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.460]   Jesus severs our sin nature.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.160]   There's only two places in the world
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.140]   where it's normal to talk about circumcision, okay?
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.880]   One is the church and two is the nursery and the hospital
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.520]   when you just had a son and that's it.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.680]   Like you can't just bring that up at your work lunch,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.840]   you know, hey guys, what do you guys think
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.340]   about circumcision, you know?
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.220]   [congregation laughing]
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.980]   And here's why, and it's about to get graphic
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.300]   and I'm doing this strategically,
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.900]   not to just try to distract you,
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.300]   but I mean, we're talking about removing
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.560]   the foreskin from a penis, okay?
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.820]   It's silly, I know, it's okay.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.520]   But listen, listen, here's why I say it like that.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.220]   Because that's what he's talking about.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.860]   Like it's crazy.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.180]   Like all of a sudden he's writing,
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.920]   he's like, yeah, the fullness of Christ
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.620]   and you know, Christ has the fullness of God
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.760]   and circumcision.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.680]   [congregation laughing]
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.000]   What?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.720]   So why is it relevant?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.820]   There's an incredible theological profound reality in this.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:35.480]   That as a shadow of the one who would come,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.440]   who would remove our flesh, which is just another word
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.640]   for our sinful nature, our sinful desire,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.320]   for thousands of years, God's people were set apart,
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.880]   specifically males, were set apart by the removal
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.960]   of that skin from that very sensitive area,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.660]   which in males, frankly, is the organ that drives them
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.600]   to a lot of their sin nature, right?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.040]   It's a metaphor, but it's a shadow of what was to come.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.440]   It's incredible, think about it.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.600]   I mean, it's still a common practice today.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.840]   And it started with God, the creator of the heavens
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.600]   and the earth said, hey, I want you to do this.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.660]   And then Jesus comes and Paul writes, he says,
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.400]   hey, Jesus, I'll read it to you again.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.600]   In him, you also were circumcised with a circumcision
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.840]   not performed by human hands, not by doctor's hands,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   but your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.320]   when you were circumcised by Christ.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   Okay, Jesus comes in your life and removes your sin nature.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.420]   What does that mean?
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.160]   He removes your desire to sin.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.120]   And you say, wait, no, he didn't.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.720]   Oh, yes, he did.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   When you are yielding to your master, you are not sinning.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.900]   When you are sinning, you've left the form.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.760]   You said, hey, I no longer wanna be ruled by you
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.480]   and I'm gonna go look for another master.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.700]   Today, it's Patron, tomorrow, it's this, that, the other,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.520]   whatever that is for you.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.320]   Pornography, cocaine, materialism, whatever,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   the list goes on and on.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.200]   Shame, guilt, religiosity, self-righteousness,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.280]   whatever that is for you, legalism.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.960]   I've left the reservation, I'm now ruled by another master.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.600]   But when I'm ruled by the one who gave me
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.700]   the circumcision of my heart, removing my flesh,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.920]   I am not in sin, I'm finding life to its fullness.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   I have his fullness.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   This is so important for us to grasp.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.320]   It's why I start so vulgar, because Paul does it.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.600]   There's like, he's like, he's grabbing your attention
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:39.300]   with a huge word, a grotesque concept.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   To make a point, this is what Jesus does to your heart.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.940]   When you were born again in Christ,
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.420]   there was a change in your heart that occurred.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.540]   The things you enjoyed in sin become difficult,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.960]   more difficult to enjoy.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.940]   Let me say it a different way.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.700]   That which was irresistible becomes resistible in Jesus.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.340]   Where one day, you were like, I can't not do that.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.300]   And now, it's like, I don't want to do that.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.320]   While there's still something inside of me
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.700]   that wants to do that, as I yield to you, Christ,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.020]   I don't want to do that.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.900]   In fact, your spirit in me convicts me when I do do that.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.320]   Not so that I feel shame, you've removed the shame,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.020]   you nailed it to the cross, we'll talk about next week.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.460]   But you've given me a spirit to follow.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.280]   Before conversion, I could sin and delight in it.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.860]   I would not have pause, I wouldn't care about the girl.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.460]   If I pretended to care about her,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.620]   that was just me running game.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.100]   I mean, that was me trying to be sensitive.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.300]   I didn't care about her.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.580]   But then after conversion, I couldn't continue
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.280]   to do those things without caring.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.640]   Do you see what the spirit of God did there?
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.700]   I began to feel convicted.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.200]   My heart was circumcised.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.980]   Jesus curbs your appetite so that you could come
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.220]   to a place where you say, God, what would you have me do?
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.740]   I no longer want to do what I want to do,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.380]   what my appetite says I should do,
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.480]   what my lustful flesh says I should do.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.820]   God, what would you have me do?
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.680]   Philippians 3, verse 19 talks about non-Christians
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.240]   in this way.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.860]   Their destiny is destruction.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.560]   Their God is their stomach, and their glory
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.280]   is in their shame.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.840]   Their mind is set on earthly things.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.300]   What does it mean that their God is their stomach?
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.720]   They follow the urges of their flesh.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.380]   They follow their appetite.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.740]   They follow their cravings.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.280]   They follow their cravings.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.480]   We follow Christ.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.840]   Non-Christians follow cravings.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.420]   Christians follow Christ.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.960]   The regenerate Christian, the born again Christian
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.800]   is given new cravings.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.160]   And so you say, you hear and you say,
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.100]   well, man, what if this isn't true, JP?
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.000]   What if I still crave all the old things?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.480]   One of two things is true about you.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.720]   So let me just break it down in a real way.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.660]   One, possibly, one of two possibilities.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.640]   One of two possible outcomes.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.680]   One, you have not trusted in Christ.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.320]   Trusted in Christ, his death and resurrection
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.560]   Because when you do that, his spirit is deposited in you
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.160]   as a seal, a promise of eternal life with God.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.240]   And so if you can sin right now and not feel convicted
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.320]   and continue like a dog to his vomit to return
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.640]   to that thing and it not be a thing,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.200]   then you may not have trusted in Christ.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.640]   Or, second possible outcome, maybe you have.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.760]   Maybe you're here, maybe you're a Christian,
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.880]   maybe we're gonna be together in heaven,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.580]   but you're not abiding with Jesus.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.120]   You're not walking with him, you're not rooted in him,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.040]   you're not building up on the foundation of the gospel,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.240]   the thing that you trusted in.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.640]   You just, somehow you got saved,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.860]   you got your ticket into heaven,
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.320]   and then you've run off the farm.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.720]   You have the collar around your neck,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.000]   it says whose you are, you just don't believe it.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.900]   And you're looking for another master.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.840]   I get an email like this nearly every week.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.580]   So this is representative of hundreds of emails.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.140]   So if you feel nervous that I'm reading your email,
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.300]   no need to, it's hundreds of emails, truly.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.980]   It starts out like this, it was one line.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.300]   I need some advice on how to end a porn addiction.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.260]   That's all it said.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.580]   I wrote back.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.980]   I was there, bro.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.340]   I assume you mean it when you say you want advice.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.620]   I assume you are ready to do whatever it takes, make war.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.820]   First, regeneration every Monday night
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.100]   until you complete the program.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.200]   If you are in Dallas, if you are not in Dallas,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.840]   join a faith-based recovery program.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.180]   Number two, join membership in the church, ASAP.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.280]   Number three, meet with a community group weekly
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.500]   for confession and prayer.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.980]   Number four, stop being alone with your girlfriend,
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.800]   get rid of your computer or smartphone.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.040]   Number five, this is a question for you to answer.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.300]   How can you learn your Bible?
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.380]   And this is the important part
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.600]   if your kind of works radar is going off right now.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.860]   All of this instruction is simply to help you pursue Jesus
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.500]   with your whole life.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.780]   And you will find life like you never have,
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.660]   Matthew 10, verse 39 I wrote.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.940]   Whoever loses his life will find it.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.420]   Whoever finds his life,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.640]   whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.960]   You can do this.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.940]   Here are some additional resources that might help.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.820]   It's a blog, it's our porch blog.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.860]   We wrote on pornography, a video,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.460]   a marriage porn apart on YouTube from our conference here.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.560]   And essentially, and that's a JP.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.720]   Essentially, these are just resources to be rooted,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.820]   built up and strengthened.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.220]   He or she wrote back, thanks.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.300]   I do all of that, but I just can't seem to stop.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.260]   Is there any new approach to holding on better to Christ?
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.980]   To which I wrote back, I'll read it to you.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:46.020]   Anybody here want a new approach to pursuing Christ?
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.860]   Let me read this to you.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.480]   New approach to holding on better to Christ?
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.320]   That's like asking,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.780]   is there a new approach to holding onto a cliff
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.840]   suspended hundreds of feet above the ground,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.500]   fighting gravity with your fingertips
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.980]   as death beckons for you from below?
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.020]   You hold on for dear life because you must in order to live.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.460]   You shed weight, Hebrews 12, one and two.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.820]   You throw off anything that is helping gravity
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.420]   in its effort to kill you.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.220]   Is there a new approach to holding on better to Christ?
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.460]   Let me make sure I understand.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.980]   You have completed region.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.700]   If so, let's meet together with your sponsor this Tuesday,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.380]   if not, be there Monday.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.440]   I don't show that you are a member,
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.960]   but that might be an error on my end.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.400]   Forgive me if that's the case.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.460]   Can you confirm that you're a member?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.220]   Who are others in your community group?
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.720]   Can you add them to this email?
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.500]   I'd like them to be there when we meet
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.740]   and better understand their counsel to you.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.220]   Congrats on getting rid of your smartphone or PC.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.740]   This is so hard for people in your situation.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.260]   It definitely separates those who are playing games
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.140]   from those who are serious about getting well.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.140]   Lastly, I didn't see your response.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.340]   How can you learn your Bible better?
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.220]   New approach to holding onto Christ?
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.460]   Help me understand your old approach.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:58.440]   I assure you, the Jesus who interrupted God's fury
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.400]   at your sin has not let you down.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.840]   Does he have your all?
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.300]   He gave his.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.120]   Please respond in detail to the questions above.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.100]   Praying for you now, JP.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.940]   And so if you want a new approach to pursuing Christ,
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.280]   would you try his approach?
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.400]   Coming to him with your need?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.000]   Saying, God, I've been playing games.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.360]   I've said I know you.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.900]   I wanna be king of Dallas or Fort Worth or Plano
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.140]   or wherever I'm at.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.780]   I wanna be queen of my work and my area,
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.700]   my apartment, my neighborhood.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.100]   I want everyone to love me.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.420]   I wanna be God, not worship you as God.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.080]   Lord, I need a savior.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.840]   And I know you sent Jesus to die for my sins.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.300]   You put him on the cross because I had that abortion,
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.100]   because I got drunk one too many times,
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.740]   'cause I slept with my significant other multiple times,
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.900]   because I did that that night
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.600]   and I swore I'd never tell anyone.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.500]   Because of the things that I've done.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.860]   I put that stuff up my nose.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.700]   I put it in my veins.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.540]   I smoked that.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.260]   I drank that.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.080]   I did that.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.280]   And when I didn't, I thought I was good enough
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.940]   that I didn't need to walk with you.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.880]   I didn't need to turn to you.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.320]   New approach to holding on to Christ?
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.840]   You, like Max, do everything you can
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.180]   to get back to the farm.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.480]   You swim the river, you walk miles,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.800]   you do whatever you need to do to cling tightly to Jesus,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.920]   who gave everything for you.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.840]   Not to be saved, but because you are.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.260]   And if you're not, then start there.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.200]   I'm a sinner and I need a savior.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.500]   I need you, Jesus.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.920]   There's no new way to experience God.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.180]   It's being rooted in Jesus.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.160]   You return to the basics that you were taught at first,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.120]   the gospel, that he died for your sins
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.960]   and raised from the dead.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.200]   You build on that foundation.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.820]   Jesus knows the will of God.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.240]   Man's wisdom will never, ever surpass his.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.680]   There's no one on the planet who knows better than Christ.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   There's no one smarter than the Bible.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.720]   And you reflect on the gospel and give an outpouring
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.600]   of thanks that he gave his life for you.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.480]   And so in summary, Jesus strengthens your stance.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.520]   Jesus satisfies your searching.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.400]   And Jesus severs your sin nature.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.380]   A full life will not be found apart from Jesus.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.760]   And some of you, like Zach, you've left the farm,
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.680]   you're searching, you're opening doors,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.280]   you're looking behind them.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.500]   You're going places you know you shouldn't,
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.360]   but you're in search of a better master
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.240]   than the one who came to be master of you.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.840]   And you think there's something else out there
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.800]   that's gonna fill you, some other wisdom,
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.840]   some superior knowledge than God's wisdom.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.040]   Do the things you did at first.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.400]   Grow in him the same way you came to him.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.720]   Through the gospel, start there.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.320]   He is a good master, scratch that.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   He is the only best, superior, absolute master.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   In him there is freedom.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.600]   There's a story that's been told about Abraham Lincoln.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.560]   I read it a few weeks ago and I thought
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.920]   I'd share it with you here.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.200]   I'll just read it to you.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.960]   There's an old story that Abraham Lincoln
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.720]   went down to the slave block to buy back a slave girl.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.800]   As she looked at the white man bidding on her,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.200]   she figured he was just another white man
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.920]   going to buy her and then abuse her.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.840]   He won the bid and bid until he won.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.260]   And as he was walking away with his now new property
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.320]   at that time, he said,
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.640]   young lady, you are free.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   She said, what does that mean?
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:01.380]   Am I free to say whatever I want to say?
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:06.200]   And Lincoln said, yes, my dear, you are free.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.040]   You can say whatever you wanna say.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.240]   And she says, does that mean that I can be
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.640]   whatever I want to be?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.200]   He said, yes, my dear, you're free.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.900]   You can be whatever you wanna be.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:27.320]   And she says, does that mean I'm free
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.480]   to go wherever I wanna go?
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.640]   And he looked at her and he said, yes, dear.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.240]   I've purchased you and I've set you free.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.100]   You're free to go wherever you wanna go.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:46.280]   And she said with tears streaming down her face,
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.480]   then I will go with you.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:53.000]   Whenever you see that kind of master,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.480]   you wanna follow it.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.520]   Don't you see this message is not try harder.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.880]   It's not go out there, grip the will.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.160]   Hey, you know, you get in that bar and you feel bad.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.040]   You should feel ashamed.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.060]   No, but you follow Jesus right out of that bar.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.560]   If that's your thing, if drinking is a problem for you,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.880]   you follow Jesus right out of that sin.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.920]   He's not leading you there.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.560]   Like the only way you got there
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.680]   is because you weren't surrendered to him as your master.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.840]   Whatever that sin is,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.560]   the only way you got in that dude's apartment,
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.720]   it wasn't because you were following Jesus.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.360]   It was because you were following some dude
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.720]   with a messianic complex, claiming to be Jesus in your life.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:40.040]   He's going to be a God awful Jesus, a miserable Jesus.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   But I know a great one who came to set you free,
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.000]   that you would follow him, that he would give you life.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.400]   You will not experience life
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.100]   as it was intended to experience apart from him.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.620]   You will be left empty.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.660]   I say that from experience.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.240]   I'm someone who has been left empty
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.160]   and I found life in Christ.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.280]   I found life in him.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.040]   It's amazing.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.360]   I wanna invite you into it.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.680]   As we move to worship, I pray that you would reflect on this.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.000]   Let me pray now.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.900]   Father, we're pleading for you.
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:22.160]   We want the fullness that is found in Christ alone.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.160]   We thank you that you came not to put a leash on us, God,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.720]   or to tie us to a tree,
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.580]   or to put shackles of religion on us, God.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:37.560]   But you unshackled us.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.640]   You untied the leash.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.620]   You untied the rope and the chain.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.000]   And you said we're free.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.700]   Now follow you to life.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.880]   Thank you for Christ's example.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.720]   Thank you for all that you've done for us in him.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.880]   Thank you for the life that you've given us.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   Thank you for freedom that can be found in him alone.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.240]   And so, Father, as we worship you,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.640]   would you help us to reflect on that freedom?
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.680]   I pray we would worship with reckless abandonment,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.280]   that we would, that literally as we sing to you,
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.160]   shackles would hit the floor,
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.680]   that as we sing to you, the chains would hit the floor,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.800]   and that we would follow you to freedom.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
