[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.420]   Continuing this series, Datable,
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.520]   where we have been walking through,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   asking questions that generally nobody ever asks,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.080]   from God's word to the question of,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.920]   hey, are you datable?
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.740]   Is she datable?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.580]   Is he datable?
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.540]   And tonight, we're gonna continue that theme
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.640]   and walk, like we mentioned a second ago,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.320]   what it looks like to date according to the principles
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.280]   from God's word, the datables, if you will.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.320]   Let me start with a story of kind of something recent
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.680]   in my world, my life.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   My son is five years old,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860]   plays on a soccer team called the Knights.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.420]   His dad is the coach, which would be me.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.760]   This team had our first game last Saturday.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.120]   We had a couple of practices under our belt,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.560]   got four on four, five-year-olds,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.360]   got six five-year-old kids,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.220]   looking at 'em, trying to teach 'em how to kick the ball.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.840]   We go to the game, and we get smoked.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.440]   I mean smoked like, just obliterated.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.880]   One of the kids on the other team,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   like, they stopped counting score after some point,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.440]   'cause it was 12 to zero, and it was like,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.580]   this is so demoralizing, especially for five-year-olds.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.920]   But they get a juice box, they bounce right back,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.000]   but to the point where, there was a kid, no lie,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.080]   they're running down the field,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.540]   and this is a kid on the other team,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.440]   who was like the next Ronaldo or something.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.760]   He runs, and he, at the end,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.480]   does a sliding kick into the goal.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.580]   Then, gets up, runs, and does a knee slide,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.240]   like he's in, like Pele, with the Superman.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   He's fine.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.260]   It was like, man, I'm just so impressed right now.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.280]   Honestly, guys, we're getting to be a part
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.300]   of seeing the next Pele.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.140]   This is special.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.700]   I didn't think it could get worse,
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.260]   and I assumed this has gotta be the best team
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.140]   that we're gonna play, and so we went back to practice.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.300]   Hey, this is a soccer ball, teach 'em the fundamentals.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.140]   Here we go, guys.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.780]   Then we had our next game.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780]   It was this Saturday.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.300]   I thought there couldn't have been a better team
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.220]   than the last one that we played, until I saw this team.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.880]   This team beat us 13 to zero, and it was four on four,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   and in the last half, the second half of a two-part game,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.700]   they only played with three players,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.740]   and their coach was like, you guys gotta pass it
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.300]   eight times before you score.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.700]   (audience laughs)
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.380]   It was like total mercy rule, and it didn't help
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.180]   that our own players were scoring on our goal
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.380]   at some points, but this team was remarkable.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.740]   I mean, they were running plays.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.860]   It was like, I have failed all of you as your coach.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.300]   I'm so embarrassed, and I realized something after the game.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.940]   The coach on the other team was hired by the parents.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060]   He's a professional soccer coach trainer.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.780]   Yeah, when you're doing that for five-year-olds,
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.060]   there's something wrong with the parent in that situation,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.500]   but he was teaching them everything, every play.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.180]   They knew just what to do, because they had
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.940]   this professional coach that was coming along
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.540]   that had equipped and trained and prepared them,
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.020]   unlike in our team, where we're just trying to get 'em
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.820]   to stop picking daisies and stuff and play the game,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.880]   and they just got destroyed.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.740]   What does that have to do with dating?
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.660]   Well, I think oftentimes in life, a lot of us
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.660]   are like my son's team that was unequipped to play the game.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.020]   In other words, unlike the other team,
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.700]   where they had coaching and they had somebody
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.040]   who taught 'em how to come along and professionally
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.860]   just knew exactly what they're doing
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.540]   and knew exactly how to train a five-year-old,
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.900]   most of us go through dating, and we just get,
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.780]   like my son's team, just destroyed,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.100]   because we've never had a good coach,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.300]   someone to teach us how to approach this subject,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.420]   and by that, you may be thinking,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.920]   no, man, I know exactly what I'm doing.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.420]   Most of us learn how to start dating,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.420]   and most of us started dating and learned to date
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.660]   all around the same time, right after puberty,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.340]   15, 16 years old, that's kinda when you were introduced
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.020]   to at least some strong interest in the opposite sex,
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.620]   and it's around that time that kinda generally,
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.580]   everybody is learning how to do it together,
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.820]   whether it's their friends are telling 'em how to date
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.700]   and how to think, or whether it's society and culture
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.880]   and Taylor Swift and Cory and Topanga,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.260]   they're all teaching 'em, this is how you should think,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.580]   about relationships.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.600]   And sadly, having the wrong coach
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.040]   that doesn't walk through play by play
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.620]   leads to a lot of us having a lot of baggage
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   and a lot of pain and a lot of destruction in our lives.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.500]   And so the good news is, God,
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.140]   more than any person in this room,
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.460]   wants you to have an amazing marriage.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.380]   More than any person that is in a dating relationship,
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.680]   God is more for you having an amazing marriage someday
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.100]   than even you are, and so all throughout the Bible,
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.860]   we are given principles and truths to help inform
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.100]   how we think about love, romance, marriage,
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.980]   who to look for.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.300]   We said before, the Bible doesn't talk about dating
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.420]   because it wasn't around back then,
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.480]   but it has a lot to say about decision-making,
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.820]   about evaluating, about romance, about marriage,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.860]   about the type of qualities that make for a good spouse.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.340]   And so what I wanna do is I wanna walk through
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.900]   and apply some of those principles as it relates to dating,
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.260]   how to go from the ask out to the alter,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.940]   because this is the single most important
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.660]   human relationship you're gonna decide.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.940]   And so you and I need to go in with the right mindset,
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.860]   looking for the right qualities and characteristics.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.460]   And to anyone in the room who's going,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.820]   hey, you're just gonna take principles,
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.100]   and the Bible doesn't talk about dating,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.840]   and so you're just gonna tell me kind of
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.940]   what your experience and what your perception is.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.780]   Let me simplify.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.980]   If you're just going, hey, what is the ultimate?
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.280]   I want just a quick answer.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.460]   How should I date?
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.660]   How can I date God's way?
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.500]   I'm gonna give you the answer.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   Here, two words.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   Honor them.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.240]   Honor her if you're a guy.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.340]   Honor him if you're a girl.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.480]   Now the problem is, is that this idea of honor,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.660]   'cause you could just be that simple and be like,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.020]   let's go watch the milkshake game.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.580]   The problem is we live in a society and culture
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.620]   that has lost an understanding
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.080]   of what it means to honor someone.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.840]   We're so self-absorbed and so self-focused
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.920]   and so selfie culture that when it comes to a relationship
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.840]   that is not about ourself, 'cause by definition,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.560]   a relationship is putting our eyes on another person,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   we've lost an understanding of how to honor them.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   And so what I wanna do, and I am so committed,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.560]   and I want with all of my heart
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.520]   what I'm about to say to happen,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600]   I wanna walk through, based on the last 12 years
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.000]   of experience, based on what God's word teaches
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.500]   and how to apply principles to honor them
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.740]   in every phase of the dating relationship,
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.680]   my full sinned hope for this message
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.140]   is that God will launch amazing marriages in this room.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.640]   That guys, there's gonna be a girl
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.120]   that you look to in this room, you ask her on a date,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   you end up getting married, send me a card.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.800]   That there are girls, he asks you on a date,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.960]   you end up getting married, you have babies,
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.540]   and you raise disciples who love Jesus.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.700]   That is my unashamed goal, candidly,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.280]   and if everybody gets married next week
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.720]   and we're gonna become a young married ministry together,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   we will do that, that would be amazing.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.220]   And so that is my hope and my goal.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.660]   And so what I wanna do is I wanna walk through
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.940]   with Ben and Becca, that's got a cute ring to it,
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.060]   I'll say that, Ben and Becca are gonna help us
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.660]   walk through the different stages.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.720]   They're just gonna sit, and as we progress through,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.940]   they're gonna come, so will you guys help me
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.740]   welcome one more time Ben and Becca to the stage?
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.740]   (audience cheering)
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.280]   It's just a milkshake until it isn't.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.840]   All right, Ben, you're gonna be right over here
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.620]   at the ask out seat, you're gonna be right over here
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.000]   at the ask out seat, we're gonna walk through
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.280]   each of these seven stages as it relates to
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.880]   how do I honor the other person?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.000]   As simple as this may seem, if you will apply these truths,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   you will be automatically in the top 1% of daters out there
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.320]   and so my heart is to see you thrive.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.000]   Are you guys blowing kisses or something back here?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.400]   What did I miss, anything you'd like to say?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.680]   Okay, so stage number one is the ask out, the meeting.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.320]   This is very, very important, so men, listen up here.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Guys, ask girls on dates, on dates, not to hang,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.960]   sir, you can clap for that, not, don't ask to chill,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.360]   don't ask what you got going on, don't ask,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.680]   hey, you know, got any plans this week?
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   Don't text or DM at 11.30 at night like a weirdo
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.000]   and say you up, don't do any of that.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.900]   You find them in person, you ask them on a date,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.480]   when you do, you use the word date, D-A-T-E,
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.080]   very important, you use that word.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.760]   You may not care about it, she will care about it
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.240]   'cause if not, you'd be like, hey, you know,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.640]   what you doing, she's like, I don't know
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   what you're asking me to do.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.280]   And it, you're welcome.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.680]   In addition, again, I'm just talking to the men
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.800]   who wanna be in top 1%.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   If you're great being the bottom 99,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.440]   like everybody else in the world, you do you.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.360]   If you wanna be in top one, hey, this is also an addition.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.000]   You give them specifically what you would like to do.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.920]   In other words, you say, in other words, you say,
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.200]   hey, I'd like to take you on a date this Saturday night.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.880]   If you don't have plans, I'd love to take you to dinner
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.600]   and then go to an art museum, I'd love to go to a walk
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   after getting some Tex-Mex, you tell them
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.760]   what you would like to do.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.300]   Here's why this matters.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.120]   You've been thinking about this for like six hours
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.240]   or at least six, you've been thinking maybe for six days,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.340]   you're gonna ask her, you may have like your small group
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.600]   texting you, how's it going, have you asked her yet?
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.360]   You've been thinking about it.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   She hasn't, she's getting like .0 seconds to evaluate,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.220]   do I wanna do this?
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.980]   And so you can honor her by giving clarity
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.980]   to exactly what I'm asking you to participate in or to do.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   In addition to that, girls, go on dates.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.560]   Don't go kick it, don't go say yes to hanging,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.280]   don't say yes to you up, say yes to dates.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   In my opinion, this is my opinion,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.560]   a godly girl should go on a date,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.280]   just give a godly guy a date.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.200]   I mean, I hear this every week of girls going,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   you know, the problem is guys just never ask girls on dates.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.040]   Part of the problem is also that girls,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.800]   when they do get asked, they end up saying no
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.440]   and they just contribute to this culture.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.780]   (congregation cheering)
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.720]   And honestly, man, I haven't done this the last 12 years,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.080]   I will see some of you guys all the time,
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.900]   especially these porch leader or porch volunteers,
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.920]   porch leaders, I'm just gonna pick on you for a second
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.280]   'cause I'll see some of you guys, I'm like,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.880]   man, that's a cute girl, we should take her out.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.760]   Or here's, you know, there's somebody in our church
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.000]   and, or here's a cute guy, I'm gonna arrange that date.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.880]   And without ever meeting them or even seeing them in person,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   they will immediately pull up the phone,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   pull up the Instagram account and see a photo,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.040]   a single photo and say, no, I don't do beards.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.100]   I don't do beards, what?
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:22.400]   I mean, you're looking at, sometimes it's a private account
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.960]   so you're looking at a tiny, tiny, tiny little head
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.440]   and you're deciding this person
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.480]   is not worth spending any time with, I'm not attracted to them
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   attraction is something that grows over time
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.720]   and it grows through conversation,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   it grows through getting to know someone's personality
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.440]   and you're gonna say through a photo, no?
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.280]   Especially when other believers around you are saying,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.240]   hey, you guys should go on a date.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   So girls, go or say yes to dates, not anything else.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   Guys, if she says no, you respect her and you honor,
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   you don't stalk, you don't think she's just playing hard
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.400]   to get, I'm gonna ask again tomorrow.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.880]   She's not playing hard to get.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.120]   Said no, for whatever reason, she doesn't wanna do that.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.440]   Matthew chapter seven, verse 12 says,
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.000]   a reflection of honoring that in everything you do,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.560]   do unto others as you would have them do unto you
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.640]   for this sums up the law and the prophets.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.480]   So here's some questions people are gonna ask.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.960]   Can Ben, can he DM Becks over here?
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.920]   Is that an appropriate way to ask out?
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.560]   I mean, sure, if you were gonna rank like what is the,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.440]   what will she respect and appreciate more?
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.880]   You could put them in this rank, ask them in person.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   If you have their phone number,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.320]   you can ask them on the phone.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.640]   Then you got text message, then you got DM,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.520]   then you got Snapchat down at the bottom dwellers
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.160]   and then Tinder all the way at the basement down there.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.400]   And if you will ask her in person
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.000]   and Ben looks like a standup guy.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.480]   Sure, he does this all the time.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.900]   Ask in person, Becca can then decide and I'm telling you,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.000]   they will appreciate both the clarity and your willingness
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.280]   to be courageous in doing that 'cause that's the challenge.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.880]   I mean, here's why we don't like to ask.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.760]   Here's like why guys like to go,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.960]   this lady's good for you to know for better or for worse
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.580]   is there's part of us that fears rejection.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.560]   So anything we can do to avoid being rejected,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.000]   we're gonna naturally drift towards that.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.380]   And so because I'm afraid to be rejected,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.480]   what happens is we end up going back and forth
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.820]   on some sort of texting or some social media,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.360]   like 50 different times and it's some version of like flirty
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.740]   why are you asking me all these questions back and forth?
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.520]   'Cause they're just trying to put the feel out
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.160]   and I'm telling you guys, be courageous.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.440]   If you risk being rejected and she says no,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.140]   I am so proud of you.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.600]   You crushed your part.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.680]   If you honor her by asking in a way that says
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   it's specifically a date,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.400]   here's specifically what we're gonna go on,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.600]   you and she says no, you have crushed your part.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.640]   I am so proud of you and you are officially
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.760]   in the top 1% of date asker outers.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.800]   Congratulations.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   Don't determine it based on whether or not they say yes.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.520]   That's the asker.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.000]   Okay, so let's say Ben, he asked Bex,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.760]   this is outside of the milkshake game,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.780]   he asked her on a date, she says yes,
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.480]   then they're gonna move to the next seat,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.340]   which is the date.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.940]   What does it look like to go on that date,
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.600]   honor God, honor her, honor him and do that together?
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.340]   So the second idea is the date or the second phase.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.700]   Where?
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.180]   Again, all of this underneath honor one another.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.620]   Romans chapter 12 verse 10 says honor everyone.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.860]   Honor, honor.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.360]   The date, where should you go?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.800]   Somewhere in public and somewhere
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.640]   you can have a conversation.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.620]   The entire point of dating is to evaluate
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.860]   is this someone that I want to spend more time with,
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.900]   someone that could be over the course of time,
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.300]   someone that I move in a relationship
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.620]   that moves towards marriage with.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.140]   And so every date is a chance to get greater clarity,
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.780]   not to impress them, but to in some ways,
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.540]   interview and interrogate who is this person.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.700]   This is a huge role.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.780]   No more important relationship in my life exists
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.620]   than my wife.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.820]   So I wanna make sure that on dates,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.980]   I'm getting to know this person before I rule them in
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.820]   or rule them out.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.940]   What does this mean?
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.980]   It means that going to see an Avengers movie
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.620]   for the first date, probably not a great move
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.140]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.260]   She's not gonna like it.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.460]   And you won't be able to talk and communicate.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.300]   Okay, there's a couple of Avenger fans over here.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.620]   Point being, man, you can do that at home.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.460]   You can do that alone.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.020]   Go and have a conversation,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.180]   a place where you can communicate together.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   Maybe that's going to dinner and on a walk,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.020]   dinner and a sports game, lunch and a walk,
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.260]   lunch in an art gallery.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.780]   And let me set this,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.780]   'cause the bachelor has created such pressure for men
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.240]   to think, oh my gosh, the first date, I gotta go big.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.180]   I gotta get us tickets to fly up to Vail
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.260]   and then we're gonna do a one day trip
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.160]   or I gotta pick her up in a helicopter.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.340]   Don't do that, don't do that.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.180]   One, she's gonna find it creepy.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.700]   Like, bro, this guy is desperate.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.900]   He picked me up in a helicopter.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.260]   I was all about it and it's not necessary.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.820]   And so you take her on a date,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.060]   you spend time, you have a conversation
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.540]   and Ben, let's say he's getting to know
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.180]   and he's speaking with Bex and they're on that date
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.180]   and the bill comes.
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.700]   What should Ben do?
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.540]   Ben pays for her date.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.220]   I don't know where our world lost this,
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.700]   but it is not honoring.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.380]   If I was to ask you to come with me to the store
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.460]   and I was like, hey, you wanna come to the store with me?
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.020]   And while we're driving to the store,
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.940]   I say, I'm asking you to do something
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.140]   you weren't going to do until I asked you to do, a date.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.960]   On the way to the store, I ask you,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.540]   hey, would you mind paying for half the gas
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.420]   in the car on the way there?
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.300]   You'd be like, bro, you asked me to come with you
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.940]   to the store.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.460]   If you're gonna ask her on a date,
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.080]   you pay for the meal.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.540]   As simple as that is, for whatever reason,
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.980]   so many people don't know that.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.480]   You don't split the check, you don't use a coupon.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.980]   Coupons are probably fine, I guess.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.980]   But you pay for her meal, you honor her.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.420]   What should we talk about?
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.820]   What should you talk about on the date?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.180]   This is another area where, man,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.180]   Christians, they just get weird, man.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.260]   It's weird.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260]   You got several weird where you go,
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.500]   I was encouraged by the brother earlier
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.140]   who was like, I probably wouldn't do that on the first date,
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.980]   I'd keep it light.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.980]   That is the correct answer,
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.300]   that you keep it light, not heavy.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.260]   You keep it intentional, but not intense.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.340]   You keep it casual and not creepy.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.980]   You're not asking, hey, how many children
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.820]   would you like to have?
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.500]   And what would you like to name them?
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   And this is what I plan to have.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.420]   You walk through and you keep it casual
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.340]   and you keep the conversation.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.360]   You ask where they're from.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.700]   What do they like to do for hobbies?
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.980]   How many siblings do they have?
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.020]   Where do they work?
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.940]   When was the first time that they went to the mountains?
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.620]   Any question that's just gonna keep the conversation,
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.460]   you're just getting to know this person.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.740]   It's just a date.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.220]   And so you pay for the meal,
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.540]   you do it at a place where you can talk,
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.500]   and you talk and you keep it light.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   If there's a second date possibility,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.420]   if at the end of the date, Ben is going,
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.460]   man, I really had a great time.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.980]   And so I think I'd like to ask her to go on a second date.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.060]   And he makes that ask and he says,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.920]   Becca, that milkshake was delicious.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.340]   I would like to go get another milkshake with you.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.880]   And Becca is sitting over here and she's thinking,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.060]   not me, not me.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.620]   She doesn't say, sure, that would be great.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.580]   Why?
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.960]   'Cause that's a lie.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.260]   She doesn't want that.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.880]   Ephesians chapter four says that Christians
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.100]   are to speak the truth to one another in love,
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.460]   that we are to be honest.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.780]   And so if at the end of the second date
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.620]   or at the end of the first date,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.180]   you don't wanna go on a second, hot take number two,
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.820]   I think a second date is always a good chance
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.820]   to make sure you've properly evaluated
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.220]   because a single meal together
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.980]   with the waiter interrupting you
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.520]   and with you guys trying to talk and converse
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.760]   is not always the perfect,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.820]   man, I'm just going on a soap bar.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.820]   It's not always the perfect opportunity to evaluate.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.660]   Why?
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.480]   'Cause some of you guys are introverts,
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.320]   some of you guys are extroverts,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.460]   some of you guys are comfortable meeting new people,
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.460]   some of you guys aren't comfortable.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.300]   And so if you judge an entire person
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.500]   based on, oh my gosh, that one awkward interaction,
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   you're probably gonna rule out some strong candidates.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.180]   But you do you.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.980]   So anyways, she, at the end of the date,
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.100]   decides I do wanna go on a second date
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.380]   or she's thinking I'm not sure if I want to.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.200]   What does she say?
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.540]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.180]   And Ben, because I know this bro is probably a gentle man,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.860]   he, when he asks her, say,
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.860]   and if you'd like to take some time to think about it,
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.280]   you can get back to me or you can let me know.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.100]   Now let's say Ben has a great milkshake, great time,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.820]   doesn't really wanna go further.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.700]   At the end of that date, does he say,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.800]   man, this was great, I'll call you?
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.700]   Not unless he's going to call her.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.500]   And this has really become a big deal.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.180]   And it's funny, but you guys are doing this.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.780]   You just lie.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.300]   You ghost people.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.940]   It's not honoring to God.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.620]   And so if it's not true, don't say it.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.780]   And what happens, and the reason why knowing this
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.100]   is important is because whenever we're in that situation,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.340]   we just get nervous.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.380]   And so we're sitting there, we're on the date,
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.740]   and they ask us, and he's like, oh my gosh,
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   I didn't see that coming.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.260]   And then he asks, and I'm like, uh, yeah.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.780]   And so knowing, I'm in.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.620]   Now I know what to do.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.780]   If I don't wanna go on a date with someone,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.500]   I just say, thank you so much for dinner.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.280]   This was really fun.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.680]   I'm just not interested in going on a second date.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.200]   So we go out in public.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   If there isn't a second date
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.500]   or if there's gonna be a second date,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.020]   we speak the truth.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.260]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 15.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.000]   Rather speaking the truth in love,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.700]   we are to grow up in every way.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.140]   We're honest with other people.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.780]   But let's say the relationship keeps going.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.220]   Ben and Beck, they go on a few more dates,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.060]   a few more milkshakes, they get the Tex-Mex,
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.220]   things are going great.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.380]   And they find themselves at a place
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.960]   where they're in that kind of middle zone,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.700]   where it's not clear boyfriend, girlfriend,
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.980]   but they're going on some dates.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.180]   And it really would be weird if Ben found out
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.220]   that Beck was going on a date with another guy
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.100]   and he's like, man, I gotta lock this thing in.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.860]   They move to what is called the DTR.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.900]   They move the seat.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.100]   You guys don't know about the DTR.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   I'm about to tell you about it, okay?
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.520]   DTR stands for what?
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.820]   Define the relationship.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.300]   This is that moment where maybe it's four or five dates in,
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.420]   Ben finds himself or you find yourself
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.280]   or that person finds himself going,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.180]   man, I wanna date this person exclusively.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.820]   I don't wanna leave her wondering
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.220]   'cause so many people leave, so many people wondering.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.060]   I wanna make clear, I would like to move this forward
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.940]   and I'd like to ask her to be my girlfriend
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.620]   out of an attempt to honor her.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.580]   And I'm gonna define the relationship.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.060]   And that can look like sitting down
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.300]   and having the conversation
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.380]   where if it's Ben and Beck's or Sarah and Steve,
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.940]   and he says, I've really enjoyed dating you.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.500]   I'm not sure you're the person I'm gonna marry,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.240]   but I would like to pursue and continue dating you
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.280]   because you're the type of person I hope to marry.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.040]   I'd like you to be my girlfriend.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.500]   That last word, really, really important.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.020]   For you, you're like, man, titles don't mean anything.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.100]   They do to her, okay?
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.220]   And so it's really important for you to incorporate.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.100]   You're gonna sit down, you're gonna have the conversation.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.140]   And if Beck's, if Ben initiated that, and Beck's,
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.980]   Beck's?
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.700]   Or Becca?
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.620]   Beck's?
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.780]   And if she's like, man, I honestly was about to say,
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.300]   I don't really wanna keep going on dates with you.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.540]   She says that.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.920]   Or she says, I would like that.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.900]   I would like to be your girlfriend.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.740]   And Ben, I know you've been here before, I'm sure.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.640]   I know I have.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.420]   This conversation, men, there's no way around it.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   It's gonna be awkward.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.300]   You're gonna find yourself tripping over your words.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.820]   You're trying to figure out how to say it.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.460]   And you're in her car one night after the porch
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.700]   or out here on the lawn.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.820]   All of us are gonna walk past you
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.940]   and you're gonna have this conversation.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.940]   You're dating that girl.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.300]   You look over at her and you're like,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.820]   look, Beck's, and your voice is gonna start cracking
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.980]   and you're gonna feel like the Eminem song
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.440]   of like, knees are weak, arms are heavy,
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.480]   vomit on a sweater already.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.260]   Mom's getting nervous, but on the surface,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.300]   he is calm and ready.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.660]   Beck's, I,
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.220]   I would like for you,
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.880]   I'm not sure you're the person I'm gonna marry,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.780]   but you're kind of the type of person I was,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.020]   you know what he said up there.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.220]   And I'd like for you to be my girlfriend
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.420]   and you're gonna feel awkward.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.780]   It's gonna be like you went back to junior high locker room
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.220]   and you're gonna be nervous.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.500]   And you know what all of that means?
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   You're doing it right.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.300]   You're being courageous.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.740]   You're leading and bringing clarity.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.020]   I have never heard of a person who has that conversation
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.220]   and it's just like, yeah, it was smooth,
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.180]   it was easy and all that stuff.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.580]   No, that typically reflects something wrong with the guy
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.280]   or that he doesn't have interest.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.020]   And so it may be awkward, it may be clunky,
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   it may be uncomfortable,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.420]   but you do and you honor God and you honor her
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.140]   by defining the relationship
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.460]   and bringing clarity to the relationship.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.700]   First Corinthians chapter 13 says,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.380]   love doesn't leave a little mystery,
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.780]   love doesn't self-protect, 'cause that's what that is.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.460]   I mean, we just don't wanna define the relationship
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.480]   'cause we're afraid of being hurt.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.020]   Love doesn't do those things.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.020]   Love, verse five, does not dishonor others.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.220]   It is not self-seeking or self-protecting.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.060]   It's not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.380]   Perhaps the most consistent feedback I will hear
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.180]   among dating couples is, I'm so frustrated
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.580]   they send mixed signals constantly.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.900]   That they're holding my hand and they're texting me
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.660]   and then I won't hear from them for 10 days.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.540]   Or she's all about it and walking through,
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.060]   holding my arm at the mall and then it's like
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.400]   she went on a date with another guy.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.820]   It's not honoring to God, it's not honoring to them
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   and it's not okay.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.700]   You bring clarity to the relationship
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.900]   or you dishonor them and you dishonor God.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.340]   And I'm speaking to Christians who wanna honor God
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.180]   as they date.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.580]   I mean, some of you guys are so confusing.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.860]   It's like, this is what the person that you're dating
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.100]   feels like when they're trying to date.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.140]   They're like, wait, wait, okay.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.100]   Yeah, I'm like a sister to you, wait, what?
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.380]   And you bring clarity that they're not wondering,
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.100]   she's not wondering.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.140]   Okay, so then you got the DTR and let's say Ben
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.500]   made that move, he's like, I want you to be my girlfriend.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.740]   Beck said, I wanna be your girlfriend.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.560]   They move into the relationship.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.660]   This is getting exciting, we're getting closer together
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.480]   step by step, day by day.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.000]   Okay, so then they're in the relationship.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.840]   What does this mean?
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.180]   This is really important.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.740]   This means they're in a relationship.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.120]   It does not mean that they're married.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   In other words, they're still dating,
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.960]   which means they're still in the interrogation room.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.580]   They're still where Beck's is going,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.180]   hey, I wanna know everything about this guy.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.900]   I wanna know, man, I wanna meet your mom.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.940]   I wanna know where you went to college.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.500]   I wanna know how much, what's your credit score, okay?
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.740]   How much you got in student loans, all of that stuff.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.700]   You're in the interrogation where you're deciding
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.100]   who's gonna be the father of your children,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.420]   the mother of your children,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.220]   the person who will more impact your life
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.660]   than any other human on the planet
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.340]   for the rest of your life,
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.640]   who hopefully the next five decades plus,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.780]   you're gonna spend with.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.160]   You wanna make sure that you know their life,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.420]   you're understanding them,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.260]   that you're walking through
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.420]   and you're still in the dating phase.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.220]   What's their job, what makes them angry,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.340]   meeting their family.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.760]   In this stage, you wanna make sure
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.860]   that you involve other believers,
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.160]   that you have other Christian community
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.020]   that are speaking into it,
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.940]   because here's what I know about Becca.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.940]   I don't know a lot, but Becca has what is called a heart.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.920]   And the Bible says a heart can deceive us.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.500]   She can develop feelings for Ben,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.240]   and Ben can be a jerk.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.080]   Sure you're not.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.360]   But Ben can be a total jerk, a terrible pick,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.660]   not even following Jesus.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.740]   And Bex could find herself still following love.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.860]   So having other girls around who see the relationship,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.260]   who see how he treats her,
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.900]   who are kind of familiar with her patterns to go,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.900]   "I don't think he's good for you."
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.220]   Or to go like, "Ben seems like great, man.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.780]   "He seems like a really solid guy."
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.240]   I'm so excited for this relationship.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.880]   To have other believers in your life.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.720]   For whatever reason,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.520]   when it comes to making big decisions in life,
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.920]   most of us seek out counsel,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.400]   except for in this one.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.540]   The Bible says that plans or relationships succeed
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.560]   based on wise counselors or other people speaking into it.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.700]   Proverbs 15, 22 says, "Plans,"
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.140]   or you could insert relationships,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.900]   or you could insert plans to have a successful marriage,
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.820]   "Fail for lack of counselors.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.380]   "But with many advisors, they succeed."
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.320]   Additionally, other thoughts in the relationship,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.280]   you should not just be in community and continue evaluating.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.720]   You should be pursuing purity together.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.960]   In other words, not introducing sex into the relationship.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.920]   Hebrews chapter 13, verse four says,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   "Marriage should be honored by all in the marriage bed."
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.500]   That means who you sleep with.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.460]   "Should be kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.400]   "and all the sexually immoral."
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.520]   And as they continue to date,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.400]   they don't continue to move further
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.080]   into physical intimacy together.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.900]   'Cause they understand,
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.880]   hey, that's for the context of marriage.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.360]   So how far is too far?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.560]   The Bible doesn't teach that that's the right question.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.800]   First Corinthians chapter six,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.760]   a verse we've taught a lot here,
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.060]   and it says sexual immorality or sex outside of marriage,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.340]   sex with any person that you're dating.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.720]   It says, "Don't try to get as close to the line as you can.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.600]   "Flee from sexual immorality."
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.560]   So practically,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.760]   if your body,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.260]   if you find yourself with that person,
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.560]   snuggling on the couch, moving in certain directions,
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.980]   and your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.540]   you have crossed over the line.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.560]   Do I need to explain more?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.460]   If your body begins to physically prepare for sex,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.900]   you, Paul, would say in First Corinthians chapter six,
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.780]   (imitates buzzer)
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.160]   Flee.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.560]   Get up, honor her, I'm going home.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.100]   Which is not, I mean, let's be honest,
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.720]   if you're attracted to the person, that can happen.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.460]   But making sure I've got boundaries in place.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.800]   Hey, we're not hanging out horizontal
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.560]   on the couch alone by ourselves.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.060]   Doesn't, good things don't happen.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.500]   Why would that be wrong?
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.260]   Let me ask you this.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.020]   If you have a married friend,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.800]   let's just go a married guy friend,
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.320]   you know, nobody married in your life,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.920]   and he was touching the breasts or genitals
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.380]   of a woman in this room who was not his wife,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.780]   would you think that's okay?
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.220]   Why would it be any different with you?
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.260]   She's not your wife.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.660]   Just like she's not his.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.320]   And God says it's not.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.180]   In fact, biblically,
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.700]   and that goes both ways, guys and girls.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.140]   Biblically, the Bible doesn't recognize
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.900]   girlfriend or boyfriend.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.980]   It recognizes father or mother, brother or sister,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.600]   wife or husband.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.340]   The only fourth category for a relationship
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.040]   with a girl it has is prostitute.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.760]   So are you gonna treat her like your mother?
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.560]   No, she's not your mom, your sister.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.260]   Wife, she's not your wife.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.900]   She's your love with sister and prostitute.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.940]   Which one is he gonna treat you like?
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.740]   Which one do you wanna be treated like?
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.940]   The Bible says, answer that question.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.840]   You could see in how he's treating you.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.940]   And if it's wrong for a married man
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.180]   to touch the body of a woman who's not his wife,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.540]   why would it be any more wrong for you?
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.540]   The Bible would say it isn't.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.860]   So inside of the relationship, things continue progressing.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.980]   But let's say they didn't.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.020]   And Becca, they've gone on a few dates
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.260]   and Ben finds himself going,
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.820]   you know, this girl doesn't floss.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.580]   I've got some problems with just the direction
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.660]   that this is headed.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.540]   And I'm sure you do too, by the way, Bex.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.380]   You have great teeth.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.460]   She's got great teeth.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.300]   Yeah, and.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.540]   But let's say he decides,
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.260]   man, this has been great for whatever reason.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.300]   I don't wanna get married.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.340]   I'm not ready to get married.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.940]   I don't wanna continue dating.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.540]   And although she's been great
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.460]   and she has amazing character qualities,
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.820]   maybe it's personal, maybe it's the timing,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.780]   maybe he's moving.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.060]   For whatever reason, he needs to decide to break up.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.620]   And so he decides, I'm gonna come
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.320]   and I'm gonna communicate.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.020]   And I'm gonna honor you even as I communicate.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.820]   Man, I've enjoyed spending time with you.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.720]   I don't see this relationship moving towards marriage.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.760]   And so I'm gonna break up.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.000]   If you don't see a relationship moving towards marriage,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   that's your sign to break up.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And so he's gonna do that.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.840]   He's gonna come.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.500]   He's gonna honor her and be gentle and tender
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.560]   and say, we need to break up.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.240]   This relationship is not moving towards marriage.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.880]   I've really enjoyed spending time with you.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.400]   Or vice versa, if she's there
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.140]   and he's full send on Bex and Ben,
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.380]   he's got the wedding hashtag all worked out and everything,
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.880]   and she's going, no, I'm not there,
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.200]   she would say, I've really enjoyed spending time with you.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.400]   Thank you for honoring me.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.460]   Hopefully that's true.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.080]   But I don't wanna continue moving forward
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.140]   in this relationship together.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.600]   Philippians chapter two says,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.720]   we do nothing out of selfish ambition.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.000]   That I never act out of selfish ambition.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.200]   So I go and I do that, not in the way that I want to,
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.080]   but in the way that is most considerate of her.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.200]   And so I do that in person.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.320]   I don't do it on a text.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.720]   I don't send them a Snapchat.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.420]   The way some of you guys break up,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:25.360]   honestly, man, I don't even have a word for that.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.680]   The word I would have, I can't say on a stage, so.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.040]   Honor them.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.100]   Do it in person.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.240]   Send a message.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.200]   You put the interests of that person before yourself.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   Some of you guys, you need to break up
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.400]   because you're in a relationship, you know is wrong.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.280]   You know is not the right one.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.480]   And you keep going like, yeah, man, he's amazing.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.080]   And all he needs is Jesus.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.380]   And you go, yeah, that's the problem.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.440]   You're not Jesus.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.020]   And your role's not to be Jesus to him.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.000]   And you will not find Mr. Right
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.800]   because you keep dating Mr. Wrong
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   and you keep staying with Mr. Wrong.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.920]   Thanks.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.560]   So additionally, as we break up
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.920]   and afterwards we take time to heal,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.560]   that one of the worst things you can do
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.480]   is to jump right into a relationship
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.360]   after you've broken up, especially if it's a serious one,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.600]   or especially if Ben and Becca
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.240]   had been dating for six months, a year,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.980]   and you begin to ask God to heal
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.080]   and work through healing from that relationship.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.560]   But let's say they didn't break up,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.520]   or let's say they did and sometimes people break up
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.840]   and then they get back together
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.720]   and they move in to a more serious level of dating,
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.400]   which I would call the decision,
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.100]   where they are now gonna move to the next seat.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.540]   And this is the time where your relationship
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.600]   is getting more serious.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.500]   Some of you guys in here, we call it seriously dating
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.580]   or call it whatever you want.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.720]   It is basically, you're gonna go heart of the hole,
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.320]   check all the boxes before you decide,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.160]   I'm gonna marry this person.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.520]   They seem like somebody who has the character,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.320]   the characteristics, the type of person
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.480]   God says to look for.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.880]   I enjoy being with them.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.440]   And so I'm gonna do everything that I can
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.460]   to make sure that we have the same vision for marriage.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.320]   I understand the hopes and dreams
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.040]   that he has for children, she has for children,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.440]   that the future that we have
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.320]   doesn't not just unalign with each other,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.840]   doesn't unalign with God's word or what God calls us to.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.120]   And we're gonna walk through this,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   some of the final stages of dating.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.400]   And this is when,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.600]   'cause this question gets asked all the time.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.160]   I'm like, hey, how do I know when to get engaged?
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.400]   This is the answer.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.500]   When you have worked through these things,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.000]   when you begin to go, hey, I've processed these questions
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.120]   and I know the answers
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.300]   and I wanna move forward with this relationship.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.560]   And other people in my life encouraged us to do so.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.400]   That you've walked through
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.200]   and you have checked their baggage and your baggage.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.160]   That you've had conversations in this stage
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.080]   that are more intimate,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.600]   where you're hearing about his wounds,
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.580]   how those wounds, father wounds, relationship wounds,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.840]   baggage that he carries, how that impacts him,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.720]   how he's worked through some of those things,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.320]   sexual history, sexual past.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.640]   You're having conversations about,
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.200]   hey, this is the type of future that I wanna have,
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.400]   the type of number of kids that I wanna have.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.540]   This is some of the things that I feel God has called me to.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.500]   This is the stage where if Bex is saying,
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.660]   I feel like I'm called to be a missionary in India
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.620]   and he's going, I feel like I'm called to be a dentist
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.980]   in Lakewood, you gotta get on the same page about that.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.480]   And neither of which is wrong.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.340]   But walking through like, man,
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.900]   here's what I feel like God is calling me to
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.420]   and having more serious levels of conversations.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.540]   Is there sexual history?
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.800]   Do you have an STD?
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.480]   Is there baggage that you carry from your parents' divorce
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.460]   that you've never worked through?
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.720]   How have you worked through those things?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.100]   This is why I love Merge.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.020]   Merge is here in Watermark in Dallas.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.700]   It's our premarital ministry that I highly recommend,
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.420]   especially if you're seriously dating
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.120]   or if you're in the seriously dating phase,
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.460]   even before you can engage, I think it's awesome
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.020]   because they force these conversations.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.460]   'Cause it can be just kinda awkward
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.020]   to be like, out of the blue,
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:10.780]   so let's talk your sexual history and baggage
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.580]   or how many children you wanna have.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.900]   And Merge or premarital counseling
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.700]   can often help facilitate those,
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.060]   help encourage and help lead through
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.020]   just discussing things that are really important.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.540]   It can be done without it,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.040]   but alone, it can be challenging.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.260]   So I love Merge.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.060]   If you're seriously dating, I would highly recommend it.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:29.900]   It's on Wednesday nights.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.380]   It's an incredible class.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.380]   And you can find more at watermark.org.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.980]   You can even, if you're listening in from afar,
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.900]   you can do it online or you can attend via Zoom.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.040]   This is not the time.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.460]   This is a myth that people have.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.180]   In the decision phase, man, I've heard moms,
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.780]   moms from this group call in and be like,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.320]   how could you tell my kids not to move in together
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.200]   with the person that they're dating?
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.040]   Here's why.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.300]   In other words, there's a myth that in this stage,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.740]   you should move in together so that you know
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.900]   if you'll be a good fit for marriage.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.420]   Here's why that's a bad idea.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.300]   The Bible, number one, and number two, society.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.500]   Thank you.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.780]   If that wasn't enough, society,
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   even in psychology and sociology, says cohabitating,
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.580]   which is living together, before marriage.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.780]   For years, we thought, man, that would have the likelihood
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.860]   of increasing the chances that they would stay together.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.780]   And we're discovering it actually decreases
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.780]   and increases the rate of divorce by between 33 and 150%.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.520]   That's on top of a 50% divorce rate.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.560]   Those are slim odds, man.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.820]   And that comes from University of Georgia,
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.940]   it comes from psychology today.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.620]   You can just look it up, National Council
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.220]   on Family Relations, and here's why they've discovered it.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.180]   'Cause it's really interesting.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.380]   I mean, you would think, oh, you move in together,
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.180]   you live together, and you don't get married
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.380]   until you know, oh man, we made this work.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.420]   We know how to live together, we know each other's rhythms.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.100]   You would think that would increase.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.100]   Nope, decreases, and here's why.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.540]   This is really important, listen very closely.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.540]   I'm gonna try to explain as clear as I can.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.700]   The researchers say the reason it is
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.700]   is because of what they call the cohabitation inertia effect.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.260]   Now, if you don't remember physics,
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.980]   inertia is when something is moving in a direction
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.160]   and it becomes really, really hard for it to stop.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.540]   And whenever a couple moves in together,
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.460]   they begin to make life decisions that make it more difficult
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.300]   for the inertia of that relationship to break up.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.460]   Distinct from if they were not living together.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.180]   For example, they move in together,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.060]   and it happens naturally.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.260]   You're like, dude, my AT&T bill is so high.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.500]   Oh, your AT&T bill is high.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.060]   We should get the same AT&T bill.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.820]   We're already living together.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.660]   Then they decide, oh man, I need a cosigner on the lease
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.020]   for this Audi, probably not a good idea,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.420]   but I need a cosigner, and can you do it?
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.820]   And now you've got a lease together.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.740]   And then you see a dog, she's on her way home from work,
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.300]   and they have an adoption puppy thing,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.980]   and she's like, look, I got Brutus.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.260]   Hey, you're a daddy.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.980]   And you're like, whoa.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.220]   And now you got Brutus, you got AT&T phone bills,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.600]   you got all these things that all of a sudden come in,
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.100]   and before, this is what the researchers say,
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.820]   before they had the ability to properly evaluate,
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.820]   is this someone I wanna decide to marry?
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.400]   They've already begun to slide into marriage.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.620]   It's like with any subscription trial,
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.260]   I feel like this happens all the time,
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.780]   where people will say, hey, it's free for a week,
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.060]   and then after that, it's $10 billion.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.860]   And you sign up, you're like, it's free for a week,
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.700]   this would be amazing.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.720]   And then two weeks later, you're like,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.340]   still watching Ted Lasso on Apple+, wondering,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.940]   oh man, I think I was supposed to cancel that.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.500]   And you never made the decision, I wanna get Apple+.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.780]   You just thought, oh, I'll do it,
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.360]   and then I can get out of that when I want to.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.540]   And then you look up and realize, I didn't decide.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.220]   I slid.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:08.380]   And that's what costs you about $15 in Apple+.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.640]   It could cost you 15 years or more
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.180]   if you do that same offense in marriage,
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.460]   where you don't go, man, I'm deciding.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.020]   I'm sliding.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:27.140]   And man, I've seen it so many times for so many years.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.300]   And the pain and the baggage and the scars,
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.140]   because as painful as it is, right now you're 26.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.620]   And you end up marrying the wrong person,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.340]   and you divorce when you're 38,
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.460]   you're not gonna be thankful.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.300]   And all the red flags that are coming at you,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.080]   and you're just going, oh man, but we got the AT&T bill,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.620]   we got so much of our life together,
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.820]   I have so much relational equity, I can't just break it off.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.580]   I'm begging you, break it off.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.180]   So in this stage, they eventually decide,
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.660]   man, I want to spend the rest of my life with this person.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.300]   I've been honoring, living separately,
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.740]   and they come to a place where they're like,
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.900]   I want to decide.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.140]   And this is probably the most practical section
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.060]   of the message for the men.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.980]   Where Ben decides, I wanna marry her.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.500]   What does he do?
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.740]   Number one, he makes sure that marriage
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.140]   is within the near future, or on the horizon.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.020]   I personally don't think that someone should be engaged
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.060]   for longer than a year.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.780]   There could be extenuating circumstances,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   but here's what I know.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.020]   If you are attracted to somebody in dating,
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.380]   if you are attracted to this person that you're dating,
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.180]   you're gonna have temptation already.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.580]   If you're engaged, and you are like,
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.380]   you, you boo-boo, and you're picking out flowers,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.740]   and you're like, oh man, we're holding hands,
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.660]   I just can't wait to be old and wrinkly with you,
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.620]   you're gonna have so much temptation.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.100]   You don't wanna prolong that
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.700]   for any longer than you have to.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.740]   But let's say he's the one that's gonna be engaged,
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.380]   okay, he's decided, I wanna do that,
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.580]   I see marriage in the near future.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.420]   What does he do next?
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.820]   He goes and talks to her parents.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.980]   Really practically, what if her parents are divorced?
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.220]   Then you go and you talk to her mom,
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.500]   and you talk to her dad.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.860]   What if her dad's not in the picture,
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.180]   hasn't ever known her dad?
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.420]   It's gonna be probably challenging for you
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.020]   to get ahold of her dad, so I would go with her mom.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.020]   If you can't get ahold of her dad,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.180]   or there is some relationship,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.980]   I would ask for their blessing,
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.620]   or ask for their permission.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.500]   Is that old-fashioned?
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.380]   No, it's honoring to them,
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.900]   which is what the Bible commands.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.060]   And so you ask them, hey, I'd like to marry your daughter.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.380]   I'd like your blessing.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.660]   Here's what I plan to do, I plan to honor her,
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.580]   I plan to take care of her, and I plan to pursue her.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.540]   They may not be Christians, you're thinking.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.020]   They may not be.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.700]   Do you know what's gonna happen when they sit down with Ben,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.460]   and Ben's like, I wanna honor your daughter,
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.980]   I wanna care for her, I wanna cherish her,
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.540]   and I wanna love her and serve her for the rest of my life,
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.820]   like Christ loved the church.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.220]   Even if they're not Christians, they're gonna go,
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.580]   (sobs) I'm so proud of the family, man.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.660]   And they're gonna be so excited,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.420]   and you will have honored Jesus by doing that.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.900]   They'll see something remarkable,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.940]   and it's a chance for you to honor God in that moment.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.180]   So step one, make sure marriage is on the horizon.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.440]   Step two, you go and you honor,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.940]   as the Bible says in Ephesians 6,
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.980]   honor your father and your mother,
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.540]   and your future father and mother-in-law.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.260]   And then, this one I didn't see coming when I was younger,
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.060]   so I'm gonna give it just for free, man.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.180]   Then you go buy a ring.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.660]   Now, you have never thought
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.220]   about your engagement ring before.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.420]   She has, okay?
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.780]   And you think ring, you think,
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.380]   yeah, I gotta go get a diamond.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.060]   And you think diamond, you think just kind of
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.960]   a little tiny rock that's crystal, like a see-through.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.780]   She thinks princess cut, and cushion cut,
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.500]   and emerald cut, and circle cut,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.080]   and rose gold, and white gold, and silver,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.100]   and probably has some idea.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.500]   She may not, and so you just gotta evaluate,
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.180]   man, who is your girl, bro?
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.460]   Who is, what is she?
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.020]   And what type of ring does she want?
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.780]   Now, here's what I've realized about women over the years.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.940]   They talk.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.940]   And so, you don't know.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.140]   And my guess is, though, her friends do.
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:06.060]   Or they have a weird Jedi mind trick,
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.780]   sister, sister thing where they can be like,
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.900]   hey, look at these rings.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.740]   I was thinking about it for me
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.620]   if I ever get engaged someday.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.460]   Which one would you want?
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.900]   And they just do that with their friend,
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.340]   and then they've done intel for you,
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.040]   and you're like, here's the one.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.100]   You're welcome.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.380]   So you wanna pick out, make sure,
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.460]   if she's gonna wear it for 50 years, and she cares,
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.540]   congratulations, you care, 'cause she's your girl.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.300]   In addition to that, that's step three.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.060]   So now you got the ring.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.420]   Step four, you plan a proposal that she likes.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.260]   What does that mean?
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.980]   Some girls, you need to decide,
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.620]   are you gonna propose to what I would call
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.660]   the Jumbotron type, where she wants it on the game,
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.260]   Jumbotron hit the knee in front of everybody, kiss cam.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.020]   Or is she the, I want it on the bridge, moonlight,
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.820]   you know, walking, and then there,
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.060]   and it's just the two of us intimate.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.700]   I don't know, but you gotta find out the answer,
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.380]   and do it, here's why this matters.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.820]   The engagement is not about you.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.860]   It's about honoring God.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   How do you honor God?
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.860]   By loving and putting the needs of the other person
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.120]   in front of you.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.120]   Finally, then you hit the knee,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.980]   and you pull the trigger.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.380]   So you guys, you move into proposal.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.380]   All right, then you're gonna hit a knee.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.940]   You're actually in this moment,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.380]   you're gonna put it on Becca's hand,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.460]   and this is a magical ring, all right?
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.860]   Ben, show 'em how it's done.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.500]   Wow!
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:35.540]   Kiss your bride.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.300]   Okay, no, sit back down.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.940]   I'm totally kidding, somebody gave me that ring,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.740]   and I was like, play around with it.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.100]   It's totally a fake ring, too, by the way,
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.060]   I think from like, I don't even know.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.300]   Okay, so now you've done that,
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.380]   now you've moved into marriage,
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.020]   and this is where, so now it's done,
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.320]   you're in marriage, you guys can move over to final seat,
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.300]   and marriage is where really the most wonderful,
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.500]   it's where the wonderful and the work take place.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.700]   As crazy as it is, everything that's been leading up
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.460]   to this matters so much less than here,
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.540]   and this is really when all of the different sin
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.980]   in your heart, and you're gonna move in,
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.860]   because as nice as Ben is, and as nice as Becca is,
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   they're two sinners, and when you put two sinners together,
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.820]   and they've been selfish, and they've been living
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.380]   unaware of how selfish and sinful they are,
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.360]   and you put them in, and on that moment
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.220]   where they marry one another, and it is the most amazing,
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.740]   like marriage is incredible.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.740]   I wish every one of you would get married
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.240]   and have someone to spend their life with,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.660]   spend time with, raise kids with,
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.960]   have guilt-free sex whenever you want with,
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.360]   and have an amazing future together.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.100]   It's amazing, it's the greatest gift.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.580]   My team, JD's engaged, and he'll get texts from me
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.260]   all the time like, bro, I'm so excited,
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.560]   I can't wait for you to be married.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.020]   It's amazing, but marriage is also hard work.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.780]   Why, because I said it takes two sinners,
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.180]   and as nice, and great, and complimentary
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.980]   as you think you are, you're broken, and so is she,
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.260]   and you put those two together.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.760]   I didn't realize how selfish I was until I got married,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.120]   and marriage didn't make me selfish, it just exposed it.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.840]   Like when you're single right now, you can be selfish,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.960]   you can kind of have that stuff,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.680]   and you had a hard day at work, and you go home,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.480]   and you just get on Pinterest, and you scroll through,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.860]   or you get home, and you go to your room
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.400]   and play Call of Duty.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.800]   You get married, there ain't no room
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.120]   with Call of Duty you're going to.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.080]   You're gonna talk, and work through conflict,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.760]   and make decisions, and all of that's gonna come
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.480]   to the surface, and through walking with Jesus,
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.580]   we die daily to the sin, and the selfishness,
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.880]   and that's constantly, and canonly, that's something
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.060]   that for the rest of my life, I'll be doing with my wife,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.620]   and for the rest of your life, you'll be doing
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.160]   with your husband, or with your wife.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.920]   In Ephesians chapter five, it says, the husband's role,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.120]   and we're about to land the plane,
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.280]   for husbands, love your wives just as Christ
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.520]   loved the church.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.320]   He gave up his life for her.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.880]   This may be the verse that I fail to live out
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.280]   more than any other verse in the Bible,
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.400]   and yet it is a verse that I am called to live out
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.200]   every day and moment, that I lay down my life
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.360]   for my wife, that I die.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.880]   It's funny, at marriage, something happens.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.820]   Bride, groom, they were standing here,
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.560]   they walk down to what's called an altar.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.160]   Do you know what happens in an altar?
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:30.680]   On the Old Testament, sacrifice, something dies,
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.500]   and the day you and that person marry, you die.
[00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:38.140]   And she died, and you're not two, you're not one.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.180]   And for the rest of your life, it is dying to the needs
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.020]   and putting the needs of the person I'm married to
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.820]   in front of me, for the rest of the rest.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.940]   It's where the wonderful and the amazing,
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.540]   and also the work begin.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   Okay, that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.300]   from the ask out to the altar and after.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.740]   Can we give it up for our friends Ben and Becca?
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:09.620]   Hey man, that was a great proposal, bro, you're ready.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.460]   Thank you guys.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.620]   Hey, let me close here.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:17.740]   Marriage is a really big deal to God.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.620]   He talks about it often, and just in thinking
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.500]   and praying on and reflecting on how often he does
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.780]   and wondering why, we're actually told the answer.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.220]   And by big deal to God, I mean, do you know the Bible
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:34.580]   begins with a marriage, and it ends with a marriage.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.540]   It begins with a wedding between Adam and Eve,
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.300]   God being the officiant, the first human relationship.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.740]   It's the very first thing we're introduced to,
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.740]   Adam and Eve.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.180]   And then it ends in Revelation chapter 19,
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.460]   chapter 21, chapter 22, and over and over,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.900]   it talks about the wedding of the lamb,
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.900]   where Christ comes and returns for his bride, the church.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.740]   In fact, I'll just read it, it says,
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.060]   Revelation chapter 21, verse one,
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.300]   "I saw the new heaven and new earth."
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.780]   Verse two, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.060]   with the people of God coming down out of heaven from God,
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.860]   prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed for her husband."
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.120]   In Revelation chapter 19, verses six and seven, it says,
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.300]   "For the wedding of the lamb has come."
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.920]   This is John, the book of Revelation is John
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.580]   given a vision by God, and he sees,
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.480]   and he sees all the future events that are gonna happen
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.580]   at the end of time, and he says, "There's this moment,
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.100]   and the wedding of the lamb of God,
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.300]   who has come for his bride."
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:37.000]   Verse seven, "In fine linen and bright, clean,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.500]   clothes were given to her."
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.300]   And then in verse nine, "Blessed are those
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.100]   who were invited to the wedding supper of the lamb."
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.620]   It starts and ends.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.700]   Jesus' first miracle was at a wedding.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.700]   All throughout the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.540]   this relationship, this marital language is used.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.780]   And the reason why marriage is such a big deal to God
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.020]   is because marriage isn't about Ben and Bex,
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:09.020]   it's not about you and your lover, your person.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:16.660]   Paul would say, the same as the Athenian Revelation says,
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.260]   in Ephesians chapter five, he says, "For this reason,"
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.140]   verse 31, "A man will leave his father and his mother
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.340]   and be united to his wife, and the two will become
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.500]   one flesh," talking about marriage, you would think.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.260]   This is a profound mystery.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.660]   What, the two becoming one?
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.720]   No.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.000]   The profound mystery is that I'm talking about Christ
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.900]   and the church, that the Bible says, ultimately,
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.500]   marriage, why it's a big deal to God,
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.860]   is it's not just a picture of you and your bride,
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.980]   or you and your husband, it is a picture of God
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.220]   and his unstoppable, unending relationship
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.940]   with the church, his bride, and in marriage,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.420]   we're given a glimpse, a picture that points us to that.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.300]   This is really good news, because here's what
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.460]   the bride of Christ is made up of.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:05.580]   It's made up of people who didn't earn their way,
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.000]   or work their way, or clean themselves up,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.580]   and deserve to be pursued by the bride,
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.300]   or by the groom, which is Jesus.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.100]   It's made up of people who've recognized,
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:21.100]   I don't deserve it, I messed up, I'll never earn it.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.700]   And that's the first step, to stepping in relationship
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.840]   with God, a relationship that for all of eternity
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.600]   will be celebrated and will be a part of,
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.440]   between the body of Christ and Jesus,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.740]   restored fully in relationship together.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.340]   And that's really good news, because here's what
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.660]   I know about you.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.740]   I know it about you, 'cause I know it about me.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.620]   In this room, just like in this heart,
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.100]   there's a lot of dating dysfunction.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.740]   There's a lot of brokenness in your past,
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.100]   there's a lot of sexual baggage,
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.460]   there's a lot of things, you look at that list,
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.460]   and you're like, I did all of those wrong.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:53.260]   And I feel hopeless, I feel like, worthless,
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.460]   I feel like I'm, it's impossible.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.980]   And God, and the message of the Bible,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.420]   is that you, in Christ, you're, dating relationships
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.460]   may have failed, but in Christ, you are not a failure.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.780]   You may have made mistakes in your life,
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.900]   but you are not a mistake, you are here on purpose,
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.740]   God loves you, he created you, and he wants you
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.660]   to have the most important relationship you will ever have,
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.260]   which is not with a spouse, it is with him.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.700]   And that transcends any marriage in this world,
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.580]   and it also is the point of every marriage in this world.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.780]   God loves you.
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.900]   Mistakes that you've made do not define you,
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.540]   and he, in Christ, offers hope and healing.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.780]   The story's not done.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:42.180]   And the story, ultimately, it's not about you,
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.660]   it's about him, but when we take our story,
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.180]   and we say, God, I'm gonna honor you,
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.580]   I'm gonna seek to honor them,
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.740]   I'm gonna walk with other people together,
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:55.420]   we get to be a part of stepping into a marriage
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:59.260]   that understands, ultimately, what marriage is about,
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.380]   which is him.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.660]   Let me pray.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:10.220]   Father, I thank you that you have brought together
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.300]   men and women who are dating in this room.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:18.180]   And I pray that the relationships that are honoring you,
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.940]   not perfectly, but they're trying, God,
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.940]   that you would help them, that you would sustain them,
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.420]   that you would strengthen them.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:30.140]   And that if it is your will, that they would get married,
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.660]   that they would raise children to know and walk with you.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.740]   We live in a world that is dark, and increasingly dark,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.660]   so would you put together warriors
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   who operate out of love, and who walk together in love.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.260]   I pray that you would break up relationships
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.900]   that need to end, they would have the strength
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.740]   to make that step.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.700]   I pray that you would move and stir the hearts of men
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.660]   to ask women out, I pray that women would honor
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.140]   in how they engage in that conversation,
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.700]   and they would say yes on a date,
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.340]   if it's an appropriate person that they should go
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.220]   on a date with, and no if it's not.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.700]   And that you would prevent any guy from being a predator,
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.100]   and that you would expose them,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.180]   and that we would find them,
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.220]   and that we would do everything we can to protect
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.700]   and facilitate and encourage people
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.060]   to experience life in Jesus.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.460]   Thank you that you, through what you did on the cross,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.260]   have invited us into the greatest relationship,
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.380]   ultimately what marriage is about,
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.020]   which is with you, forever and ever.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.980]   We worship you now in song, amen.
