10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,240
 We are continuing the series, "Scandals,"

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,900
 looking at some of the sinners

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,200
 that were a part of the family tree

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,600
 that led to Jesus being on the planet.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,560
 And let me start with a story

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,320
 that'll give us some traction.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,540
 I, for most of my life,

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,980
 had no idea who my great-grandparents were.

18
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,700
 And I don't mean I never met them.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,400
 I mean, I didn't know who they were.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,220
 And why?

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,660
 Because my grandfather was adopted.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,000
 And he was adopted in like stork fashion.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,700
 Basically, 100 years ago,

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,840
 if you got pregnant and you weren't gonna have the baby,

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
 you would just leave it on the doorstep

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,920
 of someone in town or a doctor.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,400
 And this was small town Kansas.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,360
 And that's how my grandfather basically got adopted,

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
 is he was dropped off on a doctor's doorstep.

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,840
 So for most of his life,

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 and for most of my life and just our family's life,

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,120
 we had no idea who were we really related to.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,880
 Until my uncle Randy,

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
 and Uncle Randy is probably the person,

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,720
 I feel like this person's kind of in everyone's family.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,760
 He's like the most like Kramer from Seinfeld person

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,280
 I've ever met in my life.

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,880
 He's an artist for a living

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,120
 and makes most of his art with recyclables.

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,380
 So basically, my aunt is his sugar mama.

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,960
 And Uncle Randy was like,

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,760
 "I'm gonna track down and figure out who this person is."

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,860
 And he doesn't use ancestry.com.

44
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,240
 He's out there, man.

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,360
 So you go into his house

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
 and he's got like a spider web of pictures on the wall

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,040
 with different connections where he was gonna track down

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,960
 and figure out who dropped off

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,520
 and who were the actual biological parents of my grandfather.

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
 And he tracked people down and he,

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,320
 you can throw that up there.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,000
 He tracked people down.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,820
 He did interviews, he called people,

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,520
 he put eBay alerts for any postage stamp

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,160
 that was out there that used their zip code.

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,320
 I mean, Randy clearly had way too much time on his hand.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,600
 But he eventually found it and he found a picture

58
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,680
 and he found out who our biological great-grandparents were.

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
 And this is Rex and Faye.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,280
 And he tracked down that basically

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,000
 this was a high school pregnancy in small town Kansas

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,640
 in the early 19 teens, think like World War I.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,460
 And what happened when someone would get pregnant

64
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,160
 at that time, either they would immediately get married

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,400
 or they would give the child up for adoption

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,020
 and basically kind of well-to-do family

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,100
 or like the local town mayor decided who was his father,

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,620
 or Rex's father, said,

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,520
 "We're gonna give this child up for adoption."

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,860
 And so my grandfather went through his entire life

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,400
 not knowing who he was related to

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,460
 because even still to this day,

73
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,820
 that side of the family, they ended up not getting married

74
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,420
 and married other people.

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,920
 They never connected with their son.

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
 And what is that a reflection of?

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
 It's just kind of human nature that generally speaking,

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,740
 we're not quick to move to the forefront

79
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,420
 of their scandals in the family tree

80
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,540
 unless you're Matthew writing about Jesus.

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,580
 In other words, when we look through the lineage of Jesus,

82
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,320
 unlike today where people would have a scandal

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,440
 or young teen pregnancy and they'd kind of cover it up

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,900
 and you don't really hear much about that,

85
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,780
 Matthew sets out and begins to write the lineage of Jesus,

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,020
 the savior of the world.

87
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,220
 And the people that he talks about,

88
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,260
 it's astounding that God included them

89
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,180
 in the family line of Jesus.

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,080
 But it's also astounding that Matthew highlights them

91
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,660
 in the family line of Jesus.

92
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,120
 And so we're walking week by week

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,660
 and looking at some of the scandals that were involved.

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,620
 Last week, JD set us up and we talked through a sex scandal

95
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,940
 that involves Judah and Tamar,

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,180
 basically a father-in-law sleeping with his daughter-in-law.

97
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,620
 Yeah, that's in the Bible.

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,260
 We'll make "Game of Thrones" blush.

99
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,760
 And this week, we're gonna look at another person

100
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,100
 that has a story, that has a past, that had a profession

101
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,980
 that was among the lowest of low in her society.

102
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,740
 And so I'm gonna read through in Matthew chapter one,

103
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,100
 which is where the lineage of Jesus,

104
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,980
 it's the part that generally people skip over

105
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,700
 when they go right into the gospels.

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,540
 We're gonna look at another name and then read her story.

107
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,260
 Because this woman would be the great, great, great,

108
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,220
 great, great, great, great, great grandmother of Jesus.

109
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,860
 She was in the bloodline.

110
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,940
 So I'm gonna be in Matthew chapter one,

111
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
 I'm gonna read these verses and then go

112
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,180
 and move over to this woman's story.

113
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,220
 Because last week, we talked about how our past

114
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,220
 is not a problem for God.

115
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,820
 But this woman had a present.

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,540
 And we see how God pursued, related to,

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,900
 interacted with this woman in the midst of her sin

118
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,260
 and circumstances.

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,940
 So Matthew chapter one, verse one says,

120
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,860
 "This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah,

121
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,840
 "son of David, son of Abraham.

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
 "Abraham was the father of Isaac,

123
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,700
 "Isaac, the father of Jacob,

124
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,780
 "Jake, the father of Judah and his brothers,

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,520
 "Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah,

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
 "whose mother was Tamar."

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 So you can check that out, message we did last week.

128
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,060
 "Perez was the father of Hezron.

129
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,340
 "Hezron was the father of Ram."

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,500
 Probably the greatest guy, that is like a nose tackle name,

131
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,620
 Ram, it's amazing.

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,620
 "Ram was the father of Ammonadab."

133
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,880
 It's not a nose tackle name.

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,340
 "Ammonadab was the father of Nashon.

135
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,740
 "Nashon was the father of Salmon."

136
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,940
 It's not salmon, people, it's not.

137
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,540
 I know you think it's salmon, it's not.

138
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,440
 Don't do that.

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,560
 Somebody over here, you're like, oh, Salmon,

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
 he thinks Salmon.

141
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,960
 It's trout too and tilapia.

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,620
 Nope, it is Salmon,

143
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,280
 who is the father of Boaz,

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,900
 whose mother was Rahab.

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,420
 Now, if you grew up in church,

146
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,540
 you're familiar with Rahab, or you may be,

147
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,140
 but Rahab had not just a past, she had a present.

148
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,800
 She carried a label.

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
 We're gonna look and walk through her story.

150
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,400
 It's in Joshua chapter two.

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,240
 So if you have a Bible,

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,420
 you can flip over to Joshua chapter two

153
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,660
 and let me set up what's going on.

154
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,420
 So the nation of Israel was in slavery

155
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,300
 for 400 years in Egypt.

156
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,020
 And God shows up and you probably saw the movie,

157
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,100
 "The Prince of Egypt," greatest song track of all time.

158
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,660
 And God goes to Pharaoh, says, "Let my people go."

159
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,300
 Eventually, after 10 plagues, he lets them go.

160
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,060
 They wander around with Moses leading them

161
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,860
 in the desert for 40 years, and Moses passes away.

162
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,620
 And God says, "Joshua is gonna take over."

163
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,980
 This would have been like George Washington passing away

164
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,940
 and John Adams or whoever came after next takes over,

165
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,300
 and that's Joshua.

166
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,700
 And God says, "Joshua, you are gonna lead my people

167
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,760
 "into the promised land, the land that I've said,

168
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
 "this is where you are going to live."

169
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,020
 It's where the nation of Israel is today.

170
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,020
 But in order for that to happen,

171
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,740
 they had to go in and basically conquer

172
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,540
 all these evil tribes of people that were there,

173
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,620
 namely a group called the Canaanites.

174
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,580
 And the Canaanites had this one city

175
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,360
 that was one of the wonders of the ancient world.

176
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
 It was a city called Jericho.

177
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
 Jericho was known for these enormous walls

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,920
 that were 10 feet wide and 27 feet tall.

179
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,220
 It was a fortified city that people would travel

180
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,060
 just to come see because it was such a spectacular thing.

181
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,660
 And Joshua is told that you guys are going

182
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,060
 to take out the city of Jericho.

183
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,780
 And so Joshua decides, "Man, we gotta send out some spies

184
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,700
 "in order to kind of scout out and see what's happening."

185
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,140
 And those spies go, and here's where the story picks up.

186
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,900
 So Joshua secretly sent out two spies

187
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,020
 from the Israel camp at Acacia Grove.

188
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,400
 He instructed them, "Scout out the land

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,540
 "on the other side of the Jordan River,

190
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,420
 "especially around Jericho."

191
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,980
 So the two men set out, and they came to the house

192
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,740
 of a prostitute named Rahab.

193
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,180
 And they stayed there that night.

194
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,500
 But someone told the king of Jericho,

195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,180
 "Some Israelites have come here tonight

196
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,440
 "to spy out the land."

197
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,000
 So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab,

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,680
 "Bring out the men who've come into your house,

199
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,740
 "for they've come here to spy out the whole land."

200
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,840
 Now if you read that and you wonder,

201
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,080
 why wouldn't the king just have somebody

202
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
 bust down the door and go in there?

203
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
 Well, Rahab is a prostitute.

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,800
 And one thing you never know about prostitutes

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,880
 is who else is in that room that you may be busting in.

206
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,640
 So they don't bust in, they knock on the door,

207
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,840
 say, "Hey, we think that there's two spies that are in here."

208
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
 And Rahab says,

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,800
 "Yes, the men were here earlier," verse four,

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,320
 "but I didn't know where they were from.

211
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,660
 "They left town at dusk as the gates were about to close.

212
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,600
 "I don't know where they went.

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,240
 "If you hurry, you can probably catch up with them.

214
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,080
 "Actually, she had taken them up to the roof

215
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,800
 "and hidden them beneath bundles of flax,"

216
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,560
 basically these cloth or fabrics that had been laid out.

217
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
 "So the king's men went looking for the spies

218
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,240
 "along the road leading to the shallow crossings

219
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
 "of the Jordan River.

220
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,840
 "As soon as the king's men had left the gate,

221
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,920
 "the gate of Jericho was shut."

222
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,260
 So she, basically she lies to the king and says,

223
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,480
 "Yeah, they were here,

224
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,800
 "but they went somewhere that direction.

225
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
 "If you really hurry, I bet you can go catch 'em."

226
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,880
 And then she goes back up to where she had hidden them

227
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,600
 on the roof and covered them with fabric.

228
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,660
 She says this,

229
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:48,000
 "I know that the Lord," verse eight,

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,700
 "has given you this land.

231
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,820
 "We are all afraid of you.

232
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,680
 "Everyone in Jericho is living in terror.

233
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,000
 "For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 "through the Red Sea when you left Egypt.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,020
 "And we know what you did to Sihon and Og,

236
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,940
 "the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River."

237
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,260
 She references a battle or battles

238
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,400
 that had just happened earlier.

239
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,460
 "Whose people you left completely destroyed.

240
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,100
 "No wonder our hearts have melted in fear.

241
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,800
 "No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things.

242
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,080
 "For the Lord, your God,

243
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,080
 "is the supreme God of heavens above and earth below."

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
 How did she know all of this?

245
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,240
 Well, if you're a prostitute

246
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,360
 and you have men constantly coming through your brothel,

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
 there's gonna come times where just in the midst

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
 of after servicing men, selling your body for sex,

249
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
 you make casual conversations.

250
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,240
 She probably knew as much information

251
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,000
 as anybody that wasn't in the army.

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,640
 And she had heard about what God had done

253
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,700
 and she's asking these soldiers, like, "Were you there?

254
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,440
 "God parted the Red Sea?

255
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,160
 "Were you there?

256
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,760
 "Did it really happen that you came in

257
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,200
 "and you guys just destroyed these other kingdoms?"

258
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,140
 And the men are saying, "It's true."

259
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,460
 And she says, "Everyone here is in terror of you."

260
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,280
 And she believed and expresses her faith that your God,

261
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,800
 and this time everybody had different gods.

262
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 Canaanites had their own gods.

263
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,120
 And she says, "Your God is the one true God."

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,680
 And then she asked them for a favor.

265
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,040
 "Swear to me by the Lord,

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,940
 "you will be kind to me and my family

267
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,240
 "since I have helped you.

268
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,140
 "Give me some guarantee that when Jericho is conquered,

269
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,480
 "you will let me live along with my father and my mother

270
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,280
 "and brothers and sisters and their families.

271
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,920
 "We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety."

272
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,280
 The men agreed.

273
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,080
 "If you don't betray us, we will keep our promise

274
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,160
 "and be kind to you when the Lord gives us the land."

275
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,960
 So she agrees, she basically sends them on their way

276
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,120
 and puts down a rope for them to go escape.

277
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
 And it says, verse 17, "Before they left,

278
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,240
 "the men told her, 'We bound ourselves

279
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,740
 "'to the oath we have taken.

280
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
 "'Only if you follow these instructions.

281
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
 "'When we come into the land, into Jericho,

282
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,720
 "'we must leave the scar, or you must leave

283
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,100
 "'the scarlet rope, this red rope,

284
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,740
 "'hanging from the window through which you let us down.

285
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,160
 "'All of your family members, your father, mother,

286
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,300
 "'brothers, and all of your relatives

287
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,900
 "'must be inside the house.'"

288
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,740
 They're outside of the house,

289
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,100
 basically we can't guarantee their protection,

290
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,140
 but put this red rope in the window

291
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,940
 so we will know this house uniquely will be protected

292
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,740
 and everybody that's inside of it.

293
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,060
 She agreed to their terms, the men went off,

294
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,800
 they went back to Joshua and they said,

295
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,860
 "Everyone in the city is terrified

296
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,400
 "because God, they know, has given us the land."

297
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,260
 Oh, it's an amazing story,

298
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,620
 it's kind of a fascinating and bizarre story.

299
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,620
 Why would that be so important and relevant

300
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,260
 that Matthew would say, "I have to include Rahab

301
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,360
 "in the lineage of Jesus, I'm gonna highlight her

302
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,020
 "in the lineage of Jesus."

303
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,860
 Well, I think there's several things

304
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,980
 that we learn about God in Rahab's story.

305
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,060
 In fact, we learn about God and we learn about our story

306
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,500
 'cause there's parallels to ways in which Rahab's story

307
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,460
 is you and I's story.

308
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,420
 And I wanna walk through three observations

309
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,440
 as it relates to this story.

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,440
 The first one is that God runs after people with labels.

311
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:36,040
 God runs after people with labels, with reputations.

312
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,360
 Like Rahab had a label,

313
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,520
 a label that followed her all throughout the Bible.

314
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,360
 Almost every single time that she's mentioned except one,

315
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
 it says, "Rahab the prostitute."

316
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,860
 "Rahab the prostitute."

317
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,080
 Rahab had a label that carried around

318
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,960
 and it was reflective of her profession, of her sin.

319
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
 She had, in the midst of a culture,

320
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,200
 the Canaanite culture, can only makes ISIS look tame.

321
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,560
 I mean, this child sacrificed the evil and atrocities

322
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,280
 and inside of that culture, she had chosen the profession

323
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,420
 for whatever reason of being a prostitute.

324
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,640
 I don't know why and it doesn't tell us why.

325
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,420
 My guess is she didn't grow up as a little girl

326
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,980
 dreaming of being a prostitute.

327
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,720
 But she had to find a way to make ends meet

328
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,800
 and to pay for things.

329
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
 And so she began selling her body for sex.

330
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,680
 And that label was attached to her, Rahab the prostitute.

331
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,780
 And God sends two men into that city.

332
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,000
 They didn't know they were gonna bump into her,

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 but God did because God seeks after people with labels.

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,520
 The reason this is so important is in some ways,

335
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,740
 all of us have a label.

336
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,480
 You came in and you may not think about it that way,

337
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,760
 but there's ways in which there's sin in your life

338
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,160
 that reflects a label.

339
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,840
 Maybe of a past decision you made,

340
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,800
 something you've never told anybody about.

341
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
 And if you were honest, you feel like, man,

342
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,280
 there's just some labels that I carry around

343
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
 that are attached to me.

344
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,520
 Decisions that I made in college,

345
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
 dating relationships I used to have,

346
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,900
 addictions that I can't break.

347
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,620
 And Rahab's story showcases the true God who is there,

348
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,700
 chases after and pursues people with labels.

349
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,060
 My girl on my team has this machine,

350
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,560
 it's called a label maker.

351
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,680
 It's actually pretty amazing.

352
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,500
 I personally have never used one before,

353
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,020
 but organized people, this is your thing.

354
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,220
 And you can create labels that allow you to put on

355
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,660
 whatever papers or documents or anything you want,

356
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,100
 different labels.

357
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,060
 And there's labels that I think if we were honest,

358
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,880
 some of us carry around and it feels like they define us.

359
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,140
 And Rahab's story shows us there's a God

360
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,900
 who seeks, pursues, and replaces labels.

361
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,740
 What do I mean by labels?

362
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,100
 I mean things like, I'm Alex the bulimic.

363
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,820
 And nobody knows, but it's a label you carry,

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,100
 and you have carried, and you kind of think

365
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,000
 you're gonna carry it your whole life.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,260
 Maybe it's a label like Andrew the unwanted.

367
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,060
 Just relationship after relationship,

368
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,700
 if it's taught me anything, it's that I am not wanted.

369
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,000
 Damaged goods, no one wants to be with me.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,020
 And there's a label that you've embraced or that's attached.

371
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,460
 Maybe it's Sam the alcoholic.

372
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,020
 And it went from man, I was just partying,

373
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,540
 and I was a fraternity brother,

374
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,160
 and now I can't go more than a couple days.

375
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,880
 I'm drinking all the time just to numb some of the pain.

376
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,020
 Maybe it's Susie the one night stand.

377
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,620
 (audience laughing)

378
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,980
 You would never say it like that,

379
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,400
 but somewhere in your heart, you think,

380
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,580
 nobody wants a relationship with me.

381
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,780
 Closest I can get is giving my body away.

382
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,780
 It's a label.

383
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:08,820
 Maybe it's Kristen the abused.

384
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,100
 Something happened and it wasn't your fault,

385
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,420
 and you still carry pain and scars.

386
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,740
 Maybe you even believe lies,

387
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,280
 and that label you feel like is so attached.

388
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,360
 Maybe it's the label of, man, I'm just depressed.

389
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,820
 I can't get out of this season.

390
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,020
 I don't know if I'll ever get out of it.

391
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,780
 Maybe it's a porn addiction that,

392
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,620
 man, I just need to get married

393
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,100
 because I'll never be able to conquer this.

394
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,760
 And you have bought into this idea of labels.

395
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,500
 And Rahab's story, as we enter into it,

396
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,940
 I wanna showcase is that God pursues people with labels.

397
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,340
 He could have chose anybody to be

398
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,580
 the great, great, great grandmother of Jesus.

399
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,300
 And he chooses a woman with as clear of a label

400
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,180
 as anybody in the Bible.

401
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,020
 Now it begs the question,

402
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,620
 why would Matthew go out of his way to highlight this?

403
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,140
 Well, if you remember, Matthew had a label.

404
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,980
 You remember it?

405
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,940
 Matthew the tax collector.

406
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,460
 Matthew was an outcast of society.

407
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,100
 Matthew's the one right in the lineage of Jesus.

408
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,020
 And he was, by an outcast, I mean,

409
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,700
 tax collectors were seen as people

410
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,540
 who God had totally given up on.

411
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,060
 They were not welcome to go to church.

412
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,580
 They were not welcome to meet with a rabbi.

413
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,220
 They weren't welcome in society.

414
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,780
 They betrayed their own people

415
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,460
 in order to tax them and make money off of them.

416
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,260
 They were seen as people who clearly didn't believe in God

417
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,340
 'cause of the lifestyle they lived.

418
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,340
 And Matthew lived, and he was Matthew the tax collector,

419
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,240
 until one day he meets Jesus.

420
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,660
 And Jesus walks up to him,

421
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,940
 and he'd never talked to a rabbi before.

422
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,300
 Rabbis didn't talk to tax collectors, but this one did.

423
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,860
 And he walks up in Matthew chapter nine,

424
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,620
 and we're told he walks up to the booth

425
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,140
 or to the desk that Matthew is taxing his fellow country,

426
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,900
 fellow countrymen.

427
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,100
 And he says, "Matthew, come follow me.

428
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,820
 "I want you to be my disciple."

429
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,420
 Matthew had never had anybody want him to be around.

430
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,540
 And so we're told that he gets up in Matthew chapter nine.

431
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,380
 They went on from there.

432
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,200
 He saw a man named Matthew.

433
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,040
 He said, "Follow me."

434
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,900
 And Matthew got up, and he followed him.

435
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,300
 It makes all the sense in the world

436
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,400
 that Matthew, as he's writing the story,

437
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,260
 includes this woman who had a label

438
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,940
 because Matthew had a label.

439
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,480
 And she wasn't just the part of the story.

440
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,740
 She was the point of the story

441
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,640
 that he was about to write for the next 27 chapters

442
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,860
 in the book of Matthew,

443
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,440
 that our God seeks and runs after people who have labels,

444
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,780
 who have pasts, who have present sin that mark them.

445
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,900
 My friend, his name is Shane,

446
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,860
 and eight years ago, when we were looking to buy a house,

447
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,100
 he was telling us just basically his advice.

448
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,460
 I'm about to tell it to you right now.

449
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,940
 My wife and I were looking to buy a house,

450
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,620
 and he was like, "Bro, here's what you need to do, okay?

451
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,940
 "If you're balling on a budget, I'm gonna help you out.

452
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,820
 "You wanna find the house that nobody wants."

453
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,980
 He said, "I only buy foreclosures.

454
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,060
 "I go to the bank, I find the foreclosures,

455
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,780
 "and the house that you want is the house

456
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,520
 "that makes everybody else be like, nope, her past.

457
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,140
 "The house that has foundation problems.

458
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,800
 "The house, if it's got mold, how much mold?

459
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,860
 "You want the mold.

460
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,940
 "You want a house that's so dysfunctional,

461
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,380
 "it scares everybody away so that you can get it

462
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,020
 "for a price that's like, oh, 75 cents, sold.

463
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,940
 "That's the house that you're looking for.

464
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,880
 "The house that everyone else says, oh, no, no way,

465
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
 "there's dead people or they died in here.

466
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,780
 "That's what you're looking for, bro."

467
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,620
 And I was thinking about that this week,

468
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,660
 and in some ways, that's a reflection

469
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,500
 of the God in the Bible.

470
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,260
 He's looking for the people that society, that the world,

471
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,340
 that if you feel like you're too far gone

472
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,740
 and too broken and too messed up,

473
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,380
 that makes you the perfect candidate for the grace of God.

474
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,260
 The great-great-grandmother of Jesus

475
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,060
 is selling her body for sex.

476
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,260
 And God says, she's in the family line.

477
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,020
 That's exactly the type of person he's looking for.

478
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,060
 In fact, it makes you a better candidate

479
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
 'cause a lot of people think the labels they carry

480
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,180
 is I'm Barry the Bible reader, I'm Barry the good guy,

481
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,180
 or I'm the type of person that God

482
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,300
 does want a relationship with

483
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,060
 'cause I've done everything right.

484
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,820
 And the mindset of a person

485
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,660
 that will be able to have a relationship with God,

486
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,940
 somebody that understands, I carry labels

487
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 whether I want to or realize it,

488
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,420
 but God seeks after those who are labeled or have labels.

489
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,820
 And not just that, he does something else.

490
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,760
 Verse 20.

491
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,860
 So after the city falls, in other words,

492
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,100
 they go back to Joshua and God says,

493
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,940
 "Hey, here's the plan.

494
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,180
 "You're gonna walk around the city."

495
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,380
 It's a really unconventional plan

496
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,460
 we don't have time to go into fully,

497
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,700
 but it says, "For seven days,

498
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,800
 "you're gonna get the marching band.

499
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
 "You guys are gonna walk around

500
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,460
 "the city of Jericho seven times.

501
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,780
 "And then on the seventh day,

502
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,020
 "you're gonna walk around it seven times.

503
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,180
 "And at the seventh time, you're gonna yell,

504
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,600
 "play the trumpets, get the trombone going,

505
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,620
 "and the walls are gonna fall."

506
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,860
 And it happens.

507
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,380
 Verse 20.

508
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,200
 When the people heard the sound of the rams and the horns,

509
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,360
 they shouted as loud as they could.

510
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,420
 Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed.

511
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,740
 And we're told by archeology,

512
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,480
 the walls actually fell outward.

513
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
 Why is that significant?

514
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,820
 Because walls, if something imploded, it would fall inward.

515
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,180
 They fell outward.

516
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,620
 As though it was an act of God,

517
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,740
 creating ramps for the Israelite army to run up into.

518
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,900
 Israelites charged into town and captured it.

519
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,940
 They completely destroyed everything in it

520
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,820
 with their swords, men and women, young and old,

521
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,260
 cattle and sheep, goats and donkeys.

522
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,020
 And Joshua said to the spies,

523
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,560
 "Keep your promise.

524
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,440
 "Go to the prostitute's house

525
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,620
 "and bring her out along with all of her family."

526
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,060
 The men who had been spies went in

527
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,180
 and they brought out Rahab, her mother, father,

528
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,780
 all of her family.

529
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,420
 And they moved her whole family to a safe place

530
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,540
 near the camp of Israel.

531
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,180
 So all the walls just fell down except one house.

532
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,540
 This one part of this huge wall,

533
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,140
 'cause remember, Rahab lived in the wall,

534
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,260
 and there's one house with a window

535
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,380
 that has a red rope, scarlet rope, hanging in it.

536
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,360
 And Rahab, in the midst of all the chaos,

537
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,380
 somebody comes, knocks on the door and says,

538
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,580
 "We're moving you into the family of God."

539
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,120
 The second idea we see from the text

540
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,980
 is that God rescues people with labels.

541
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,840
 He rescues people with labels.

542
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,480
 Rahab was rescued and saved by grace,

543
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,860
 not 'cause she deserved it,

544
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,280
 but because of the undeserved favor of God on her life.

545
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,840
 In other words, if God was gonna destroy Dallas,

546
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,320
 like you heard, hey, he's gonna take out Dallas.

547
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,700
 He's gonna save one person.

548
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,660
 Who do you think he would save?

549
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,080
 Like we'd probably go through our list and be like,

550
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
 man, he probably, you know,

551
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,540
 there's probably a really nice grandma somewhere

552
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,640
 he's gonna save, or like, you know,

553
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,260
 a really high priest or pastor out there,

554
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,320
 or somebody high in philanthropy

555
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,820
 that has given a lot of money.

556
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,260
 Would you choose a prostitute?

557
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,460
 'Cause that's who God chose.

558
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,580
 And he rescues Rahab by grace,

559
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,300
 the same way that he still rescues people today,

560
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,460
 'cause God rescues people with labels.

561
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,380
 And then he moves them to the family of God

562
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,700
 and he changes their labels.

563
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,620
 But she was saved by grace.

564
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,300
 Grace is a word Christians throw out.

565
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,980
 It's just a word that means undeserved favor.

566
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,060
 Mercy is not getting the punishment you deserve.

567
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,660
 Grace is not getting the punishment you deserve

568
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,040
 and getting something better that you don't deserve.

569
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,660
 I've said it before, my son, Crew, when he was four,

570
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
 I took him to his room.

571
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,300
 He basically had hit his sister and was like,

572
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,140
 you're getting a spanking.

573
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,660
 We sat down and I decided,

574
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,380
 I'm gonna make this an object lesson for grace.

575
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,740
 I'm gonna teach you son right now, father of the year.

576
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,960
 So I walk him through and explain,

577
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,940
 you know what, I'm gonna give you grace.

578
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,140
 Do you know what that means?

579
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,620
 It means I'm gonna hit myself

580
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,340
 and I hit myself as hard as I could or hard,

581
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,040
 and I'm gonna give you candy.

582
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,100
 That's grace.

583
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,580
 You don't get the punishment you deserve

584
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,500
 and you get something amazing you don't deserve.

585
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,380
 Which kind of backfired because ever since that moment,

586
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,180
 every time he gets in trouble, he's like,

587
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,380
 please, please, I want grace.

588
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,200
 I want grace.

589
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
 I want grace this time to mommy.

590
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
 Hit mommy.

591
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,960
 I'm like, whoa, okay.

592
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
 Not exactly how grace works.

593
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,820
 But it reflects that, hey,

594
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,060
 that is what Christians believe.

595
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,260
 They have never believed.

596
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,300
 And you may have been taught this,

597
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,140
 or you may have been raised,

598
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,360
 and we went to confirmation,

599
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,500
 or you went and were taught that Christians

600
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,580
 have a relationship with God because they deserve it,

601
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,100
 or they earn it, or they maintain it

602
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,540
 because they do enough good things.

603
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,380
 That is a lie.

604
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,540
 That's not a Bible idea.

605
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,580
 That is a worldly idea.

606
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,940
 The belief of Christians is that

607
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,180
 only by undeserved favor, aka the grace of God,

608
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,720
 by grace you have been saved through faith.

609
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,900
 And this is not of yourself so that no one can vote.

610
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,840
 The only way anybody gets a relationship

611
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,580
 is the God who rescues people with labels

612
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
 by grace through faith.

613
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,420
 What's faith?

614
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,000
 Faith is believing God, trusting in him,

615
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,660
 trusting in our sins and what Jesus did on the cross

616
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,420
 as payment for your sin.

617
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,840
 That's what Christians believe.

618
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,140
 The way you become a Christian is I believe

619
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,640
 Jesus paid for my sin on the cross,

620
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,780
 and he rose from the dead as proof for that payment.

621
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,620
 Boom.

622
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,540
 And Rahab, 1,500 years before Jesus would live,

623
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,980
 expressed I believe your God.

624
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,100
 You guys, they're out wandering in the forest.

625
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,640
 She's sitting in the most walled,

626
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,580
 protected city in the world, and she says,

627
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,080
 "I know your God is the one true God, and I believe.

628
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,420
 "And so I'm gonna hide you because I believe

629
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,580
 "that your God is gonna do what he has promised to do."

630
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,960
 And that was a faith that saved her.

631
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,540
 So much so that multiple times,

632
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,720
 Rahab is pointed to in the New Testament

633
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,840
 by New Testament writers.

634
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,520
 It's pretty astonishing when you think about it.

635
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
 They point to Rahab as much as they do

636
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,440
 so many other characters in the New Testament,

637
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,280
 where they pull back.

638
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,160
 In James chapter two, the brother of Jesus,

639
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,000
 he says, "I'm gonna give you two examples of faith."

640
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,820
 I mean, it's crazy.

641
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,660
 James, the little brother of Jesus,

642
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,160
 wrote the book of James, and he pulls out,

643
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,820
 and he's like, "Let's talk about faith.

644
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,840
 "Two people I wanna talk about.

645
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 "Father Abraham had many sons, the father of our faith."

646
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,400
 In James two, he talks about Abraham.

647
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,340
 And then he says, "I'm gonna give you another example."

648
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,420
 You would think he would go, I don't know,

649
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,580
 David or Noah or Isaac or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

650
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
 There's a lot of people.

651
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,480
 Who does he pull?

652
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
 James chapter two, verse 25.

653
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,120
 "In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute

654
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,280
 "considered righteous for what she did

655
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,300
 "when she gave lodging to the spies

656
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,180
 "and sent them off in a different direction,

657
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,600
 "but she believed, and it changed her."

658
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,880
 And then, I think one of my favorite ones,

659
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,440
 the hall of faith.

660
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
 Hebrews chapter 11 is called the hall of faith.

661
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,280
 Why?

662
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,100
 Because they go through,

663
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,940
 and it's basically like the hall of fame,

664
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,840
 only for the faith men and women in our nations,

665
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,680
 or in the family of God's history.

666
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,420
 And they go through, and they name people you'd think.

667
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,500
 They got Moses.

668
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,820
 Yeah, of course, you don't let my people go.

669
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,120
 They got Abraham, the founder of the faith.

670
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,800
 They got Isaac and Jacob, of course.

671
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,340
 And then they bring up Rahab.

672
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,940
 And he says this.

673
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,600
 "By faith, the prostitute Rahab,

674
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,960
 "because she welcomed the spies,

675
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,960
 "was not killed with those who were disobedient."

676
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,720
 Look at the next sentence.

677
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
 He's going through, and he's listed all these people out,

678
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,680
 and he's like, oh, so Rahab,

679
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,520
 that incredible faith that Rahab had.

680
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,560
 And then he says, "And what more shall I say?

681
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,980
 "I do not have time to talk about Gideon,

682
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,300
 "Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel,

683
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,880
 "and the prophets."

684
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,520
 You got time to talk about Rahab, the prostitute,

685
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,020
 who wasn't even Jewish?

686
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,680
 You ain't got time to talk about David,

687
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,620
 the greatest king in Israel, man after God's own heart,

688
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,320
 defeated Goliath, one of the heroes.

689
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,720
 Jesus is called the son of David.

690
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,800
 But you got time to talk about Rahab?

691
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,760
 That God pursues and rescues by grace, through faith,

692
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,160
 by grace, through faith, and Rahab is seen as somebody

693
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,020
 that God comes in despite her label

694
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
 and uses in mighty ways.

695
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,800
 Finally, we get to, I think,

696
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,540
 what is the best part of the story,

697
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,340
 and the romantic part of the story, if you will.

698
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,420
 It says this.

699
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,540
 "So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute,

700
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,660
 "and her relatives who were with her in that house,

701
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,560
 "because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho.

702
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,560
 "And she lives among the Israelites to this day."

703
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,740
 And she lives among the Israelites,

704
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,080
 the Jewish people, to this day.

705
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,240
 When they wrote the book of Joshua,

706
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,580
 Rahab was still alive, you could go see her.

707
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,500
 It said, man, there's Rahab, down the street,

708
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,280
 lives in a different house, no longer a prostitute.

709
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,180
 Why do I say that?

710
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,540
 Because we're told that eventually,

711
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,780
 Rahab bumps into somebody named Salmon.

712
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,000
 And Salmon, not salmon, you're gonna meet him someday

713
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,220
 if you were a Christian in heaven,

714
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,980
 he's gonna be like, well, I ain't a fish, man, I'm a man.

715
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,180
 And Salmon bumps into Rahab, and he's like,

716
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,700
 ooh, girl, man, you wanna go to lunch?

717
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,300
 They meet on jewishmingle.com or wherever,

718
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,500
 and they hit it off, they go to lunch.

719
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,300
 And then he's like, man, I really enjoyed that.

720
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,140
 I'd like to go to lunch.

721
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,580
 They go to dinner, and eventually,

722
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,020
 first comes love, then comes marriage,

723
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,820
 then comes Boaz and a baby carriage.

724
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,900
 And they have a baby boy.

725
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,300
 And Salmon did what would've been unthinkable.

726
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,220
 He didn't marry prostitutes in that day and age.

727
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,940
 But Salmon was a godly man, and he did what godly men do.

728
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,580
 And this is really important, it's a side note,

729
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
 but it's relevant to the story,

730
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,700
 and maybe relevant to your story.

731
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,940
 I hear all the time of people saying,

732
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,660
 you know, I just, I feel like I've got too much baggage,

733
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,920
 too much junk in my past.

734
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,620
 A godly guy or a godly girl

735
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,620
 doesn't want anything to do with me.

736
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,720
 A godly guy or a godly girl

737
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,880
 will see you like God does.

738
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,620
 In other words, if they're a godly guy,

739
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,340
 they don't go, oh man, hey, this is all the things

740
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,180
 that's wrong with you.

741
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,180
 That's not a godly person.

742
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,300
 That's a spiritually immature person.

743
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,260
 A godly guy sees like God does.

744
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,420
 A godly girl sees like God does.

745
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,500
 How does God see?

746
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,660
 In 1 Samuel chapter 16, verse eight, it says,

747
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,100
 I, the Lord, do not look at outward appearances.

748
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,760
 I look at the heart.

749
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,980
 And so if you are somebody who is walking with Jesus,

750
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,380
 you're buying a lie if you think that, man,

751
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,960
 a godly guy would never have interest in someone like me.

752
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,980
 A ungodly guy may hold that against you,

753
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,720
 but a godly man or godly woman sees like God does.

754
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,260
 And Solomon saw like God does,

755
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,780
 and he saw this woman who, despite her past

756
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,500
 and her brokenness, had by faith come to be a part

757
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,580
 of the family of God.

758
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,260
 And he asked her out, and eventually they get married.

759
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,420
 And she becomes a part of the royal bloodline of God.

760
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,460
 Why do I say that?

761
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,320
 Because we're told that in Matthew chapter one, verse five,

762
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,020
 Solomon was the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.

763
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,180
 Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.

764
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,760
 Obed was the father of Jesse.

765
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,020
 And Jesse was the father of King David.

766
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,300
 And she goes from prostitute to princess

767
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,240
 in the royal family of God.

768
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
 In other words, if you have judgment,

769
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,560
 you think of Rahab, the prostitute,

770
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,960
 and go, man, that's so jacked up.

771
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,120
 You are talking about Jesus' great, great, great grandmother

772
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,920
 or King David's great grandmother.

773
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,880
 Like whatever the equivalent in that day and age.

774
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,520
 Like I don't know if back then they did what we do today,

775
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,880
 where it's like, this is my mema, my papa,

776
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,200
 and we just make up these weird names.

777
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,880
 It's like, and then my hee-haw, and this is my.

778
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,960
 And whatever that was for David,

779
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,400
 if you're throwing shade at Rahab, he's like,

780
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,160
 dude, that's my great mema.

781
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,320
 That's who she was.

782
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,360
 And Jesus, think about this.

783
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,780
 The savior of the world went to the cross

784
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,860
 with the blood of a prostitute running through his veins.

785
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,100
 Running through his veins.

786
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,860
 To die for broken people.

787
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,500
 Because everyone is broken.

788
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 And the showcase of Rahab and her story

789
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,660
 is that Jesus didn't just come for sinners.

790
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,500
 He came from sinners, 'cause that's all there is.

791
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
 And inside of the story, we see that he's a God

792
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,980
 who seeks after people with labels.

793
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,580
 He saves people with labels.

794
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,140
 And finally, he rewrites people's labels.

795
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,580
 And just like he took Rahab and took her from,

796
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,820
 hey, you were Rahab, the prostitute,

797
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,580
 and now you are Rahab, the princess of the family of God.

798
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,820
 And the royal lineage.

799
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,300
 He could do that the same to you and to me,

800
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,740
 and take porn addicts like me, and say,

801
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,860
 I'm gonna take you.

802
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,460
 And by surrendering, which is what she did,

803
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,940
 she decided, I'm gonna surrender.

804
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,860
 I'm gonna go not with the people inside of the wall,

805
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,060
 I'm gonna do what's uncomfortable,

806
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,500
 and I'm gonna go after the family of God.

807
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,900
 I'm gonna surrender to God's way,

808
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,780
 even if it costs me, even if I'm afraid.

809
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,180
 I'm gonna surrender my story.

810
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,820
 Which he did, God began to rewrite it.

811
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,380
 And he can do the same for you, same for me.

812
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,500
 Like I said with me, that he has taken somebody

813
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,820
 that for years and years spent looking at pornography,

814
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,860
 and he changes the label and says, I will make you pure.

815
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,540
 He can take you as someone who is depressed,

816
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,300
 and say, I will bring about and restore

817
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,940
 the joy of salvation in your life.

818
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,220
 That's what I do.

819
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,460
 If you surrender to me, I am a label changer.

820
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,500
 I am a God who takes things,

821
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,940
 and he takes people that were abused,

822
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,380
 and he makes them whole.

823
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,460
 He takes those who felt unwanted,

824
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,460
 or one night stands, and makes them valued.

825
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,060
 Those who were bulimic, and makes them healed.

826
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,660
 Alcoholic, and makes them free.

827
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,740
 Those who felt unwanted,

828
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,060
 and he changes them and makes them desired.

829
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,380
 It's what he does.

830
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,820
 But it happens when you and I step into the family of God

831
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,100
 and allow Jesus and our relationship to him

832
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,740
 to be the thing that covers us.

833
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,820
 And just like with Rahab, whatever part of your story,

834
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,580
 your past, he takes labels that the world says define you,

835
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,100
 and he says, I've covered those,

836
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,180
 and I'm redefining the future that you have.

837
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,260
 I'm redefining the life.

838
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,420
 I'm redefining who you are,

839
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,020
 and those labels no longer define you,

840
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,460
 because what I did on the cross now defines you.

841
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,340
 And Rahab would no longer be known as Rahab the prostitute.

842
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,620
 And I love this, and I'm about to land the plane.

843
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,620
 There's one time in all of the Bible

844
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,820
 when Rahab is mentioned,

845
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,860
 and her label is not.

846
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,380
 It's only one.

847
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,500
 Every other time, it's Rahab the prostitute,

848
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,020
 Rahab the prostitute, Rahab the prostitute.

849
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,900
 Except in Matthew chapter one,

850
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,500
 when Matthew writes the genealogy of Jesus.

851
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,340
 And we've read it.

852
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,700
 I'm gonna read it again.

853
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,620
 "Salmon was the father of Boaz,

854
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,700
 "whose mother was Rahab."

855
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,300
 Not Rahab the prostitute, just Rahab.

856
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,620
 Isn't it fitting that Matthew,

857
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,780
 who lived so much of his life with a label

858
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,660
 until he met Jesus and went from Matthew the tax collector

859
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,740
 to Matthew the disciple, the author of the Bible,

860
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,940
 or one of the books of the Bible,

861
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,940
 that he would write out,

862
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,220
 and he's gonna write out the lineage,

863
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,700
 and if anybody knew labels, it was him.

864
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,420
 And he writes out, and he says,

865
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
 "His mother was Rahab."

866
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,980
 That's it.

867
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,180
 Because her connection to Jesus

868
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,780
 overshadowed the label that she carried.

869
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,060
 She's written, and that's the line of Jesus.

870
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,340
 Eventually, four verses later,

871
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,540
 it talks about Jesus, the Messiah.

872
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,580
 It's tracing up.

873
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,820
 And in so, her connection overshadowed,

874
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,700
 her relationship with Jesus overshadowed

875
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
 the labels she had carried from her past,

876
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,100
 from her present, from her sin.

877
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,420
 And Matthew distinctly knew,

878
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,620
 when you step in a relationship with Jesus,

879
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,460
 everything in your past, everything in your present,

880
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,340
 every sin in your life, it is overshadowed by Jesus,

881
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,940
 and redefined, and covered by him.

882
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,540
 And that is the most significant thing about you,

883
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,740
 if you're in this room, and you've trusted in Christ.

884
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,940
 No matter what's in your future, your past,

885
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,100
 if you're in Christ, you're a part of the family of God.

886
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,580
 And those labels don't define you.

887
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,260
 Your relationship with him does.

888
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,900
 We're told that, in the story,

889
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,980
 the way that she was saved

890
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,700
 is through a scarlet rope.

891
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,860
 They said, the only way we will know it's your house

892
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,460
 is if this scarlet rope runs outside of it.

893
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,460
 And anyone who is inside of the house that is marked

894
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,140
 by this red rope, scarlet rope on the outside,

895
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,900
 anyone inside of that will be saved.

896
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,500
 Everyone outside of that, anyone that is not in a house

897
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,980
 that is marked by a scarlet rope, will perish, will die.

898
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,580
 So make sure that the scarlet rope hangs outside.

899
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,060
 Clearly a foreshadowing of Jesus.

900
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,300
 Just like in the Passover,

901
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,980
 where the blood was covering the house.

902
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,740
 So in this scenario, where a scarlet rope,

903
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,260
 a scarlet thread, representing the blood of Christ,

904
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,860
 that anyone who has this marking their life by faith

905
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,860
 in Jesus will not perish, but have eternal life,

906
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
 will be saved.

907
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,020
 And anyone who does not have that marking,

908
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,420
 in other words, the work of what Jesus did,

909
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,700
 pouring his blood out for you on the cross,

910
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,260
 marking your life by accepting it,

911
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,260
 his payment by faith, I believe, will perish.

912
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,220
 And that same gift has been extended

913
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,940
 to anyone who will accept it by faith.

914
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,200
 God has given his life and extended the covering for you.

915
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,260
 You've got to accept it, that I'll never be enough.

916
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,100
 And I can face the battle, and I can face the war,

917
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,900
 and I can face all that life is gonna throw at me,

918
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,320
 but I'll never earn a relationship with God.

919
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,220
 But I don't have to, but I do have to accept it.

920
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,940
 And let the scarlet blood of Christ cover me

921
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,600
 like the scarlet rope covered her.

922
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,980
 Let me pray.

923
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,260
 Father, I pray that anyone who has never had a moment

924
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,140
 in their life where they make the decision

925
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,180
 to trust in what you did on the cross,

926
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,040
 paying for their sin, paying for past abortions,

927
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,980
 current addictions, current messed up relationships,

928
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,520
 abusive behavior, today would be the day

929
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,620
 that they would stop attempting to earn their way to you

930
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,140
 and just say, God, I accept it.

931
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,060
 I accept that you died for me on that cross,

932
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,480
 and that you would seek after and rewrite their story.

933
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,860
 I pray for people who, candidly, no matter how hard

934
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,380
 I try to plead with them to not buy the lie

935
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,780
 that the God who's there rewrites stories

936
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,700
 and takes broken things and ashes

937
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,900
 and makes beauty out of them,

938
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,020
 that now your spirit would pierce through their heart

939
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,500
 and they would believe, no matter how far they've run,

940
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,820
 no matter how far they've fallen,

941
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,660
 it is not too far for the grace and goodness of God.

942
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,780
 And they would experience and encounter you,

943
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,400
 and you would, through their surrender,

944
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,960
 write beautiful marriages, restore families back together,

945
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,020
 bring healing, peace, and joy.

946
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,740
 It's what you do, it's what you've always done,

947
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,660
 and the story of Rahab showcases

948
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,440
 you came for sinners like all of us.

949
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,900
 You're greater than the labels that define us in the past.

950
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,460
 You're greater than the ones that define us right now.

951
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,900
 You're greater than it all,

952
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,140
 and we worship you now in song, amen.
