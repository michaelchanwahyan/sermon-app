11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 We are continuing this series, Scandals, and looking at some of the family members of Jesus,

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 the Savior of the world.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 And tonight we're going to look at a guy that actually is so famous that people have depicted

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
 him in art.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,500
 And one of the more famous pieces of art, let me show it to you right here because it'll

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 tell you a little bit about our character.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 This is King David.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,000
 And yes, we are keeping it modest as hottest and covering up.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
 This was created by Michelangelo in 1501.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 You got to know King David is up in heaven like Michelangelo, bro, why you put me on

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 blast like that to the entire world?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 I'm just going to run myself up here and he made this when he was 26 years old, Michelangelo.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 And it was one of the greatest and still is considered one of the greatest pieces of art

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 of all time.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 It was 17 feet tall.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 It weighs six and a half tons.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 And every year over a million people travel to Florence, Italy in order to see it.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 And Michelangelo made it out of a single block of marble.

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 And to this day, people would say it is the greatest statue of all time.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 It is a picture of perfection and artistry.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 But here's what is also true about that statue of David.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 Here, you can put it back up, Alex.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 There is almost zero to little chance that King David looked like this picture.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 In fact, we know that because Michelangelo said, yeah, I based it off of another guy

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 who lived down the road.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 His name was Carl.

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 But he had the face going on and that's just what he thought of when he thought of King

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 David.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 And that picture and picturesque and manicured and perfect statue of a chiseled, incredible

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 specimen of a man was not just failing to capture what David actually looked like.

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 It also fails to communicate who David actually was.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 Now, King David is the most associated person with Jesus in the Bible.

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 In fact, in order to be the Messiah, you had to show that you were actually of the line

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 of King David.

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 He was an incredibly important person in the Jewish lineage and he was also an incredibly

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 flawed and broken person who God used in incredible ways.

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 And you may not be familiar with that.

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 You may have heard the story of David and you're familiar with Goliath and we think

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 of him, he's some hero of the faith.

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 But there are some parts of David's stories that Matthew, the disciple of Jesus, when

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 he writes the Gospel of Matthew, he starts by going through the lineage of Jesus we've

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 been walking through.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 And he wants to highlight, not the highlight reel of David's life, but the low light and

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 lowest moment David would have on the planet.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 And in doing so, he very intentionally points us to the point of the Gospel story he's about

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 to write.

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 So let me read it and it'll make sense and we'll camp out in particular where Matthew

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 highlights.

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 Matthew chapter 1, as Matthew launches into the Gospel of Jesus, says, "This is the

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham."

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 And then verse 5, we're going to pick up where we left off last week.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 "Now, Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boab, whose mother was Rahab, the prostitute.

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of King David."

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 Now, Matthew could have stopped right there.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 I mean, he proved his point.

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 All that his audience needed to know is check the box.

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 He is related to King David.

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 You can't be the Messiah unless you were related to King David.

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 King David was so significant in the Jewish mind.

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 Inside of the Bible, the only person who's talked about more than King David is Jesus.

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 The number of chapters that are written about King David is 62.

73
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 The next closest is Abraham at 14, and then Isaac at 11.

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 Elijah, Elijah, most of you guys don't even know the story of Elijah, don't have time to go into it.

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 Elijah is one of two people who never died.

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 He just went on a chariot and ascended up to heaven.

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 He's got 10 chapters written about him, and King David has 62 chapters.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 59 times he's brought up in the New Testament.

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 He's the only person called twice a man after God's own heart.

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 And Matthew could have stopped at King David, but he goes one step further

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 and brings up the most destructive decision David ever made.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 He says this, "And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife."

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 Now, if you're Matthew, think about that.

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 And you're writing the genealogy of Jesus, and you could go any way you want.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 In that day and age, they rarely brought up women.

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 They just had to include the male lineage inside of there.

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,500
 And he not only brings up a woman, he twists the knife, if you will, on who?

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 The woman who David had Solomon, King Solomon, with, who she was.

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 He doesn't even say her name.

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 He says who her husband was.

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 Why would Matthew do that?

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 Because Matthew, over and over in the lineage, is pointing out,

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 Jesus didn't just come for sinners.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 He came from sinners.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
 The most picturesque, perfect person that you could think of in the Bible

96
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 is, at the end of the day, a broken, fallen person

97
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 who, just like you, needs a Savior to save them from themselves.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 And he's about to tell these first-century, new baby believers,

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
 new Christians, some Jewish listeners,

100
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 how they are going to relate to God no longer on how they behave

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 or their relationship with God doesn't have to have anything to do with what they've done or what they do,

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 but it is entirely based on what God has done.

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 And so he brings up, you remember David, yeah, yeah, the guy who had that relationship with Bathsheba.

104
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 And I want to walk through that relationship because inside of that story,

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 we see some parallels to our own story, our own journey, our own experience in life.

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 And we also see something very important about our God.

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 So if you didn't grow up in church, I'm going to give you a high-level overview of the story of David.

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 I'm going to basically play the movie for the next 20 minutes.

109
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 I'm going to give you two takeaways.

110
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 You'll get out of here in time to go hit the fire pits or whatever we have outside.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 But I'm going to play the movie of David's life.

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 Hopefully we have some fire pits outside.

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 Here's what happened.

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 King David was born around 1,000 years before Jesus, 1,000 years B.C.

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 He was born into a very poor family.

116
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
 He was the youngest of eight kids.

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 At the time, there was a king by the name of anybody know?

118
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 Saul. That's right, Saul.

119
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 Saul was the king of Israel, and Saul was basically the Disney prince.

120
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 He's a head taller than everybody else.

121
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 He looks like Gaston, and he's, you know, the guy that everybody swoons over.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 True story, it says all the ladies are like, "Oh, man, no one looks like Saul."

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 And they watched, and Saul was that king.

124
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 But God rejected Saul.

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 And he tells Samuel, who's the prime minister of the nation,

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 "Saul is the first king, but he won't be the king for long.

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 I have chosen another king."

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 And Samuel says, "Okay, where is this other king?"

129
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 And God says, "Samuel, I want you to go to the town of Bethlehem."

130
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 And in the town of Bethlehem, there's a family and a father named Jesse.

131
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 And he has sons, and one of those sons is the one that is to be anointed.

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 So Samuel gets on his donkey or horse or whatever, shows up at Jesse's house,

133
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 knocks on the door, "Hey, I'm here to tell you that one of your sons is about to be king of Israel."

134
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 So Jesse, proud dad to be, is going, "All right, let me get all the boys together."

135
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 And he lines them all up.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
 And Samuel looks at the first son, and it says this.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 "And he looked at Eliab," was his name.

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 And Samuel 6, 1 Samuel 16, "When they arrived, he looked at Eliab and thought,

139
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 'Surely this is the Lord's anointed.'

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 And God nudges him and says, 'That's not him.'

141
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 So he's like, 'Okay, well, not firstborn, you know, rule follower, it's probably a good thing.

142
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 Let's go to secondborn.' He goes to secondborn.

143
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 And God says, 'It's not him.'

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 He's going, 'All right, we'll move to the thirdborn, kind of middle child.

145
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 I'm sure that, you know, it caused him adversity. He grew through that.'

146
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 And he goes on and on and on down to seven sons.

147
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 And each time God says, 'It's not him.'

148
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 And then in almost a comical way, Samuel is going, "Man, it's not any of these."

149
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 And he asked Jesse what had to be a funny question and incredibly insulting to David.

150
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 And he goes, "Do you have any other sons?"

151
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 And Jesse, father of the year, is going, "I do have another son. That's right. Yeah.

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 Where did I put him?"

153
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 And he goes, "He's out tending the sheep in the field."

154
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 And it says this, "Then Samuel asked, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 And Jesse replied, 'I do have the youngest, but he's out in the fields watching sheep and goats.

156
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 Send for him,' Samuel said, 'we won't sit down until he arrives.'

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 So they sent, and Jesse went and got him.

158
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 And he walks in, and David's all sunburned from the sun and sweaty from hanging with sheep and playing the harp.

159
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 And he steps inside, and this teenage kid, God says, 'That's him.'

160
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 Verse 12, "David was dark or ruddy and handsome, with beautiful eyes.

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 And the Lord said, 'This is the one. Anoint him.'

162
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,500
 Samuel pours oil on his head," kind of an ancient indicator of God's anointing on somebody.

163
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 And David, you know, is like, "That was weird," and runs back out to carry for the sheep.

164
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 Shortly, a little bit of time goes by, and David's most triumphal moment happens,

165
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 where David shows up, and everybody knows the story, especially his kids.

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 We grow up learning about David, and there's this giant named Goliath,

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 and this huge nine-foot-tall guy is tormenting the armies of God.

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 And David, as a teenage kid, says, "You don't talk to my God and my people like that."

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 And he takes a slingshot that hits David square in the forehead, or hits Goliath square in the forehead, and Goliath dies.

170
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 David becomes a hero, and eventually he's placed in the palace, and he's the king of Israel, from the pastor to the palace.

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 And one day, he's in his 30s, he just started to reign at age 30,

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 and he's sitting and he's looking in this palace, and David loved God.

173
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 And he's looking out the window of his palace, and this is in 2 Samuel chapter 7,

174
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 and he goes, "Man, I got this huge crib, and God is over there in a tent.

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 We need to build a temple to the Lord."

176
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 So he begins to go, "How much money do I have?" He's checking his wallet.

177
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 "How do we build a temple?" And God sends a messenger to David that says, "You're not going to build a temple.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 I'm going to build something through you."

179
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 And he makes an unconditional promise to David.

180
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 Here's what it says, 2 Samuel chapter 7.

181
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies has declared.

182
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 I took you, David, from tending sheep in the pastor, and I selected you to be the leader of my people.

183
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 I have been with you wherever you've gone. I've destroyed all your enemies before your eyes."

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 David had incredible victories and success in military terms.

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 "And now I will make your fame." This is a promise that today we are evidence of.

186
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 "I will make you as famous as anyone who has ever lived on earth."

187
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 Now, I don't know how much church background you have.

188
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 My guess is you came to the room, and you've at least heard the name of King David.

189
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 And God fulfilled that promise.

190
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 But there's a much more important promise that traces all the way to Jesus.

191
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 "Furthermore, the Lord says he will make a house for you, a dynasty of kings.

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 When you die and are buried with your ancestors, one of your descendants, your own offspring,

193
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 I will make his kingdom strong.

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 He's the one who will build a house, a temple for my name.

195
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 And I will secure his royal throne forever.

196
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 My favor will not be taken from him as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from your sight."

197
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 Talking about the former king.

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 "Your house and your kingdom will continue before me for all time.

199
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 Your throne will be secure forever."

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 So David is promised by God that, "I am going to place the eternal throne,

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 and eventually the Savior of the world, the King of kings, will come through you."

202
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 And he makes a covenant promise to David.

203
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 Now, David had a mountaintop moment with Goliath,

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 and this is another mountaintop moment where God makes a huge promise to not just him,

205
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 but to his children and their children and their children.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,500
 And shortly after that, David's life begins to unravel.

207
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 Now let me tell you a little bit about David in terms of, like, his family structure,

208
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 because it's important to understanding the incredible man this was that had incredible flaws.

209
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 Here's the family of King David.

210
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 So David, when I think David, I think Jake Gyllenhaal feels fitting right now.

211
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 And David was married to a girl named Michael.

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 Apparently it was a girl named back then.

213
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 David married Michael.

214
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
 And when I think Michael, of course, you're going to think T-Swift.

215
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 And David had six other wives.

216
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 He wasn't--God had not told him to do that.

217
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 He didn't obey God.

218
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 And so he ended up married to six other people, which let's just keep it all in the same family

219
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 and assume that all of them look like T-Swift, just from different eras.

220
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 How much of a horror movie would this be if you were Jake Gyllenhaal

221
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 and you're married to seven Taylor Swifts?

222
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 Okay, so anyways, Jake is married, and--I'm kidding.

223
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 That's going to upset all the Swifties who are coming after me now.

224
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 He's married to all of these different women and has a lot of dysfunction in his family as a result of it.

225
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 One of the reasons God outlawed polygamy is because all of the different competition and insecurity

226
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 and things that happened from having more than one wife and her child and my child

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 and just the infighting that took place, as you would imagine, and it did.

228
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 But all of this was not enough.

229
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 As David one day sees someone who says, "I don't just want these women.

230
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 I want her."

231
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
 And her is Bathsheba.

232
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
 And we're going to look more closely at her story.

233
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 But Bathsheba, she's Israeli.

234
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 Let's go with Gal Gadot, okay?

235
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 And David begins to have a relationship with Gal, despite the seven other women in his life.

236
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 And it leads to the destruction of his family and his future.

237
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 Here's the story.

238
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 2 Samuel 11, verse 1.

239
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:34,500
 "In the spring, when kings normally go out to war, King David did not.

240
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 He sent Joab, the commander of the army, and the Israelite army to go fight the Ammonites."

241
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 David was supposed to be at war.

242
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 We're not told why he stayed home.

243
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 He's still in his 30s.

244
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 He's relatively young.

245
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 So in the spring is when they would go off because in the winter they couldn't go battle or couldn't attack,

246
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 couldn't fight because the ground, either through snow or through mud, it would just--the wheels couldn't turn.

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 So in the spring is when kings would go and the king would ride out to lead his army in battle.

248
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 And David decided, "I'm not going to the battlefield.

249
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 I'm going to hang in the bedroom."

250
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 "Late one afternoon, after his midday rest," which is a nap,

251
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 "David got out of bed and was walking along the roof of the palace."

252
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 This guy is clearly not a very busy man.

253
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 Takes a midday nap, goes on a little stroll on the palace roof.

254
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 "And while he's there, he looked over the city and he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath,

255
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 who, because God has a sense of humor, turned out to be named Bathsheba.

256
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 And he sent someone to find out who she was."

257
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 So he looks and he sees a naked woman in a hot tub on top of the roof,

258
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 and he's looking from his palace balcony saying, "Who is that?"

259
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 And he sends a servant and he comes back and he goes, "Look at the answer.

260
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 That's Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam," who David knew, "and the wife of Uriah."

261
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 Now that should have been enough for David to go, "Okay, I'm going to go back inside with Taylor Swift and move on."

262
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 And David doesn't decide to do that.

263
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 And he makes a decision that would follow him for the rest of his life.

264
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to the palace, he slept with her.

265
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 David, after they sleep together, sends her away.

266
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 She goes back home, and three weeks later, she sends a message to David, verse 5, that says, "I'm pregnant."

267
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 Uriah is away at battle, fighting for King David, and David just slept with his wife and got her pregnant.

268
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 Not a great scenario.

269
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 And David does what we're all tempted to do in the midst of sin.

270
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 He's faced with a choice.

271
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 "I can either confess and come clean, or I can keep going and keep going, because I'm afraid of if I confess, what would happen.

272
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 So I'll just keep going and keep going, not knowing it's only going to make the problem worse and worse."

273
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 So he comes up with a plan.

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 He decides, "You know what I'm going to do?

275
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 I'm going to get Uriah.

276
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 I'm going to bring him home, be like, 'Hey, I just want to celebrate you,' and get him to go home and sleep with his wife.

277
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 No one will ever know.

278
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 No one's counting exactly how many weeks and numbers and all that, and so he'll come home.

279
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
 She'll get pregnant, and nobody will ever know."

280
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 So he brings him home, and this is what he says to David.

281
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 "Then he told Uriah, 'Come home and relax.'

282
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
 David sent a gift to Uriah after he left the palace."

283
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 So Uriah shows up.

284
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 He's like, "Hey, I just want to reward you for being such a faithful guy.

285
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
 Go home and sleep with your wife."

286
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 And Uriah walks out of the palace, and David sends a gift, and he's told he never got the gift.

287
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Uriah slept at the gate of the king.

288
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 He basically slept outside of the city gates.

289
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 He wouldn't go home.

290
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 David calls him in, and he's like, "Uriah, why didn't you go home?"

291
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 Uriah says this.

292
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 "What's the matter?" David said.

293
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 Verse 10.

294
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 "Why didn't you go home last night after being away for so long?"

295
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 Uriah said, "The ark"--the ark of the covenant, which is basically representing the presence of God--

296
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 "and the armies of Israel are living in tents.

297
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 Joab the commander and my master's men are camping in open fields.

298
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 How could I go home and wine and dine and sleep with my wife?

299
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 I swear I would never do such a thing."

300
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 How much did that prick David's heart?

301
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 As he's looking at a man who says, "I can't go live in comfort while our men are out there fighting for the Lord.

302
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,500
 I appreciate you letting me have the night off, but I will not do a thing where I'm going to go home and sleep with her while my men are out in the field."

303
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 The integrity of Uriah.

304
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 So David decides, "Okay, I'm going to have to bring out the big guns."

305
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 He brings out some vintage wine, and he says, "Uriah, hang around another night."

306
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 And this is what it says.

307
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 "We'll stay here today," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army."

308
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 So Uriah stayed that night with David.

309
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 Verse 13.

310
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 "David invited him to dinner, and he got him drunk."

311
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 We're not told exactly how or if they're playing some sort of ancient wine pong or something,

312
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 but eventually Uriah is to the point where David is like, "All right, hey, I'm going to spin you around and head that way.

313
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 That's where you're going, back to the house."

314
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 And Uriah still stops at the gate and says, "I'm going to be a bodyguard tonight for the king.

315
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 I refuse to go home and live in luxury and comfort while my men are out in the field."

316
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Uriah has more integrity drunk than David does sober at this moment.

317
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 Now, if I'm God--let me hit pause.

318
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 If this happens, and think about it.

319
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Remember, David has just slept with his wife, and now he's trying to cover it up and cover his tracks,

320
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 and Uriah has so much integrity that he's saying, "I refuse to do such a thing."

321
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 If I'm God in this moment, I hit pause and I go, "Okay, Uriah, you're now king.

322
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 David, you're now dead."

323
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:14,500
 Because Uriah displays the heart of a man that's much more easy to follow

324
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 and much more resembles Christ, frankly.

325
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 But David decides, "Man, I can't even get him drunk and go home."

326
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 And he decides what we all have the decision to make in the midst of sin.

327
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 "Man, I'm looking at pornography. Sure, we cross boundaries.

328
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 Man, it was just oral sex. Man, it was just a few drinks.

329
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 Man, it was just a little bit of money.

330
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 Am I going to keep going, or am I going to confess?

331
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 Am I going to come clean, or am I going to conceal?"

332
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 And the temptation for all of us in that moment is to think,

333
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
 "Man, if I come clean, that's going to cost me so much."

334
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 And David, if he was here, would say, "You not coming clean will always cost you more."

335
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 But he decides, "Man, I can't just bring it out in the open."

336
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 And he takes it a step further.

337
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 And the next morning, he hands an envelope to Uriah, and he says,

338
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 "I want you to take this to the general, Joab."

339
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 And Uriah takes the envelope, says, "Yes, sir," and he rides off.

340
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 And Uriah doesn't realize it, but David had written a note to Joab

341
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,500
 that basically ensured Uriah's death.

342
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 And Uriah shows up, and he has an envelope, and he's back to the commander,

343
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
 and he says, "This is from the king."

344
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 And Joab, the general of the army, pulls it out and reads it,

345
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 and he looks at it, and he reads this.

346
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest.

347
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 Then pull back from him so that he will be killed.

348
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 King David."

349
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall

350
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 where he knew the enemy's strongest men were fighting.

351
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 And when the soldiers came out, Uriah and Hittite was killed.

352
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 They put him in the very fiercest area of the battle,

353
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,500
 and then Joab pulled the men back, and Uriah was killed.

354
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 Word is sent back to David, and we don't have time to go into all of it,

355
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 but he's basically told Uriah is dead, and David thinks, "Whew, coast is clear."

356
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 So he sends word to Bathsheba, and this is what happens next.

357
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 "When Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, heard that her husband was dead, she mourned.

358
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her,

359
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives.

360
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 Then eight months later, she gave birth to a son."

361
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 The son was related to David, not Uriah.

362
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:50,500
 "But the Lord was displeased with what David had done."

363
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 He kills Uriah. He thinks it's over. Man, that was close.

364
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 What was the time right after that like?

365
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 "As he holds this baby boy that he knows was born through his sin."

366
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 Eventually, David may have thought he got away with it, but God saw all of it,

367
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 and God sends a messenger to King David.

368
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 His name is Nathan the prophet.

369
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 David's hanging out, and one day he gets a knock at the door.

370
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 "Hey, Nathan the prophet has a word from God for you.

371
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 Now, if I'm David and I know I just killed a guy and had sex with his wife,

372
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 and then I covered up--I mean, think about that.

373
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 The standard--we think of like Bill Clinton having a scandal in the White House.

374
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 This would be synonymous with him taking Monica's husband and killing her.

375
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 I mean, most people wouldn't let David serve in their children's ministry,

376
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 and yet he's the guy that's writing the Bible. It's astounding.

377
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 And Nathan shows up, and David's got to be nervous of,

378
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 "What is the prophet going to tell me?"

379
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 And he launches into a story.

380
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 And David thinks it's just a story. He's telling him something that happened,

381
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 and he's all leaned in, and here's what Nathan says.

382
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 I love the detail. Nathan, he's over there, he's just cuddling this little lamb.

383
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 One day, a guest arrived at the home of a rich man.

384
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 You see the story? Nathan said there's two men,

385
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 a rich man with all this cattle and sheep, and there's a poor man.

386
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 He doesn't have much. He's got one lamb, and it was like a child to him.

387
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 He loved this one lamb.

388
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 And one day, a guest shows up at the rich man's home,

389
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 and the rich man says, "Instead of killing from my own flock or herd,

390
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 I'm going to take the poor man's lamb, and he killed it,

391
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 and he prepared it for his guest."

392
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 And David is listening to this story

393
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 and feels what all of us would feel of the injustice, and it says,

394
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 "David was furious," verse 5,

395
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 "as the Lord lives, any man who would do such a thing deserves to die."

396
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 He just went level 10 DEF CON over a lamb.

397
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 "He must replay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole

398
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 and for having no pity.

399
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 And Nathan said to David, looked him in the eye,

400
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 'You are the man.'"

401
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 The Lord, the God of Israel, says,

402
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
 "I anointed you King of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul.

403
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 I gave your master's house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.

404
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 If that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.

405
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 Why have you despised the word of the Lord and done this horrible deed?

406
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 You have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites

407
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 and stolen his wife."

408
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,500
 From this time on, and then he lays into the sentence

409
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 that that decision would carry out in David's life.

410
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 "From this time on, your family will live by the sword

411
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,500
 because you have despised God by taking Uriah's wife to be your own."

412
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 This is what the Lord says, "Because what you have done,

413
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 I will cause your own household, your family, to rebel against you.

414
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes.

415
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 He will go to bed with them in public view.

416
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 You did it in secret, but I will make this happen openly in the sight of all of Israel."

417
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 Then David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord."

418
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 Nathan replied, "Yes, the Lord has forgiven you.

419
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 You won't die for this sin.

420
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the Lord by doing this,

421
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 your child will die."

422
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 The little baby that David had been holding was struck by a disease,

423
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 and seven days later he was dead.

424
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 That was just the beginning.

425
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 David's family, like it was told,

426
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 "A consequence for your rebellion and your sin is that your family will be in turmoil."

427
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 What happens next, we don't have time to go into all of it, but it is so crazy.

428
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 David's example as a bad father pops everywhere.

429
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 What do I mean by that?

430
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 He has an oldest son named Amnon who has this weird obsession with his younger half-sister.

431
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 It's creepy and weird looking back, but he's like, "Man, I'm just in love. I'm obsessed."

432
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 He can't have that relationship, so one day he rapes her.

433
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 He rapes his half-sister.

434
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,500
 It's discovered, and King David does nothing.

435
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,500
 This upset him, but he doesn't do what a good father would do.

436
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
 That enrages David's other son named Absalom.

437
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 Absalom says, "If my own father is not going to do something to protect my sister,

438
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 then I'll do something."

439
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 He comes up with a plan, and these are David's two sons

440
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 fighting over the sister that had been raped by one of them.

441
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 Absalom, who is the most handsome and attractive of all of David's children,

442
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 says, "I'm going to defend my sister if my dad won't," and he kills his brother.

443
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 It only gets worse from there.

444
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 Absalom knows that, "Man, I just killed this man,"

445
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 so he takes off like he's Simba in The Lion King

446
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 and goes to live for three years by himself.

447
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 Eventually, David goes, "You can come back home.

448
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 You don't have to be a fugitive."

449
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
 But David still does not give us the example of a good father.

450
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 He says, "You can come back home, but I don't want to see you."

451
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
 Absalom comes back home, and Absalom continues to go,

452
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 "My father is a failure as a dad.

453
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 He does not deserve to be king for the actions he has taken."

454
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 So he begins to recruit an army, and Absalom puts together this army.

455
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 This army all of a sudden becomes so powerful that Absalom goes,

456
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 "Man, we're going to take on the city."

457
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 He begins to march and declare civil war against King David, his own father.

458
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 David doesn't want Jerusalem to be burned, so he goes,

459
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 "All right, I'm going to get all my posse, and we're going to go out

460
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 and basically live in the wilderness until we can kind of assemble our troops

461
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 and get things ready."

462
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 David still loved Absalom.

463
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,500
 Absalom finds himself sitting in the palace, and he's like,

464
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 "Man, that's pretty nice. I mean, look at this chair. This is great.

465
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 They've got these little drinks with the umbrellas in them, and I'm king."

466
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 He declares himself king.

467
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 Then his advisor tells him to do something that's further fulfillment of this prophecy.

468
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 He says, "You know what you should do?

469
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 You should really show the people"--this is like my own translation--

470
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 "But basically, you should really show the people that you're showing

471
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 your middle finger to your dad, and you should have sex on the roof

472
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 with his concubines."

473
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,500
 So they set up a tent on the roof of the White House,

474
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 and Absalom goes in and has sex with David's concubines

475
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 to show them, "Hey, there is no reconciliation that is going to take place."

476
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 I mean, think about that.

477
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 It's hard to sit down at a Thanksgiving table after you've gone through that.

478
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 Absalom decides even this is not enough, and he marches out in the wilderness

479
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 to go find David and kill his father.

480
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 And King David is heartbroken over this.

481
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,500
 He doesn't want Absalom to die, but they go to war,

482
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 and Absalom dies in the process.

483
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 David would lose four children as a result of his decision to sleep with Bathsheba.

484
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
 Four.

485
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 David is reinstated as king, and he goes back,

486
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 and another son named Adonijah makes an attempt at the throne.

487
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 I mean, over and over and over.

488
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 He does not act like a good--he was a failure as a father to his children.

489
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 Incredible hero on the war battlefield and a failure at home.

490
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 And then on his own deathbed in 1 Kings 2, which we don't have time to go in,

491
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 David is dying, and he looks at Solomon, who is now the new king,

492
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 and he says, "I want you to do something."

493
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
 And he says, "There's two men who I don't want you to let live

494
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 to have gray hair and go to the grave in peace."

495
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 He's like a mob boss dying and saying, "Hey, you know what to do. Take them out."

496
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 That's what he does. That's literally what he does.

497
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 He doesn't even say, "Kill them." He literally says, "You know what to do."

498
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
 He's like, "You know not to let them go in peace to the grave."

499
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
 That's my best mob boss.

500
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 And David, over and over at every turn, he had some incredible triumphs

501
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 and incredible mountaintops and incredible valleys.

502
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 And so what does all of this have to do with us?

503
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 And why would Matthew go out of his way to highlight the decision

504
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 that had so much destruction in David's life?

505
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 There's two takeaways that I really want to walk through very quickly

506
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 as we think about this text.

507
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 There's two very simple things that are so applicable and relevant

508
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 to you and I's life.

509
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
 One of them is about us, in particular, sin, and the other one is about God.

510
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 And the first one is this, very simply, that sin always has consequences.

511
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 Sin always has consequences.

512
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 The temptation in that moment is you're going, "Man, it's just sex one time.

513
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 It's just not that big of a deal.

514
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 It's just pornography one time.

515
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 It's just one last time.

516
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 It's just crossing boundaries a little bit physically.

517
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 It's just taking a little bit financially and kind of cutting the corners

518
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 here and there."

519
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 And David would say, "Sin always has consequences."

520
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 The Bible says that the wages of sin is death.

521
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
 The payment you get for sin every time and I get for sin every single time

522
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 is death.

523
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
 How can that make sense?

524
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 You ever read that verse in like death, like if I steal something,

525
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 I'm going to explode or I'm going to die?

526
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 How does that bring death?

527
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 Well, David's own story shows us sin always brings death,

528
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 not just physically, but death in emotional ways, spiritual ways.

529
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
 David's sin led to the death of his family.

530
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,500
 Some of you this week is going to be really painful because Thanksgiving

531
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 and Christmas and holidays, they bring up all the fracturedness

532
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,500
 in your family, the brokenness because of your parents' divorce

533
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 that was a result of sin that led to the death of their marriage,

534
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,500
 that led to the death of your relationship with your dad.

535
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,500
 That sin ultimately and always brings about and kills things that it touches.

536
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 Some of your faith, you know, you went through college

537
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 and you used to have a faith and you were in high school

538
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 and you kind of like walked with God and then you went through this season

539
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 where you just walked away from him and it wasn't that God changed it,

540
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 that you just continued to go down a path with other people

541
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 and you went from, "Man, I'm worshiping on the weekends,"

542
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 "I'm a weekend warrior and I don't even know if I believe in God anymore."

543
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
 And it led to the death of your relationship with God.

544
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
 And David would say sin always has consequences.

545
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 It did then, it does now, it can lead to the death of your freedom.

546
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
 That's what addiction is.

547
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 I want to be free in order to do whatever I want whenever I want

548
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 and all of a sudden now I'm not free.

549
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
 I can't go this long without drinking.

550
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 I can't go this long without pornography.

551
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,500
 I can't go this long without a hookup.

552
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
 Because it led to the death of your freedom.

553
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 And David would say it always brings about death.

554
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 And it doesn't come in the form of something that you can always tell.

555
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 It just looks like, "Man, this isn't that big of a deal,"

556
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 and it's just kind of one subtle look.

557
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,500
 And all of a sudden, step by step, brings destruction.

558
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
 In Alaska, there's a common way that Eskimos will kill wolves

559
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 and they do so in order to keep wolves away from just either camping ground

560
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
 or for whatever reason.

561
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 And the way that they do it is they take a knife and they go to the shore

562
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,500
 and they find a seal and they stab the seal.

563
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 And they get the blood of the seal on that knife.

564
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 And then they take the knife and they go over to the snow

565
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
 and they roll it in the snow and then they repeat the process

566
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,500
 and repeat the process until eventually they have a huge seal blood popsicle

567
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
 with a knife inside of it.

568
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,500
 They take that popsicle knife and they go and they put it in the snow.

569
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 And wolves will smell the scent of that blood.

570
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 And Eskimos will be relatively close to the popsicle,

571
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 but the wolves don't care because they care only about the scent of that blood.

572
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
 They care only about that thing.

573
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 And then the wolves will go up to that blood popsicle with a knife on the inside of it

574
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
 and they'll start to lick it and they'll start to lick it and they'll start to lick it.

575
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,500
 And eventually, all of the snow or the seal blood moves away

576
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 and the wolf continues to lick and it's licking the knife.

577
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,500
 And it cuts its mouth open until it bleeds out and it dies.

578
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,500
 And once it doesn't even realize, it's gone past the point of no return.

579
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 And I think if David was here, he would say,

580
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 "The best option you have and I have is at every turn, wherever you're at,

581
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
 you think you're too far gone, you're not too far gone,

582
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,500
 but the best cure that you have is doing what David did eventually,

583
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 coming clean and confessing."

584
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:45,500
 James 5:16 says, "By confessing, we bring healing into our life."

585
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,500
 Galatians 6 says that, "Whatever a man sows, he will reap."

586
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
 That God is not mocked.

587
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
 And you cannot live a certain way, date a certain way,

588
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,500
 feed your mind certain thoughts, certain images, certain things,

589
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 and it not impact who you are.

590
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,500
 I wish that as a pastor, I could say that this is something that I don't have to struggle with

591
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
 or have to battle with anymore.

592
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
 Like, man, I'm happily married, I've moved on.

593
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
 I don't ever have lustful thoughts, I don't ever struggle with pride or anger,

594
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,500
 or just temptation in general, but I can't.

595
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
 That I, every day, have a choice.

596
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,500
 If I find myself still tempted with, man, there's a beautiful girl that walks by

597
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
 who bends over to pick something up, or somebody on Instagram that clicks something,

598
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
 and I know that, man, I just want to see who they are,

599
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,500
 because it kind of looks like there's cleavage in their profile picture.

600
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,500
 In that moment, I have a choice to either say, "I need to confess this

601
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
 and share with my own small group guys, 'Hey, does this happen?

602
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,500
 I'm having images that are going through my mind,'" or whatever the struggle is.

603
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
 I have a choice.

604
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,500
 Am I going to bring this out in the light, or am I going to try to carry it on my own?

605
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
 And David would say, "As long as you and I try to carry it on our own,

606
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
 we live it in secrecy.

607
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
 It's not going away."

608
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 And I have to make that choice every single day.

609
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,500
 I was like, "Nine years happily married, you don't struggle with that stuff anymore."

610
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
 It's just not the truth.

611
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,500
 And King David, who wrote so much of the Bible, if nothing else, testifies to that.

612
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
 And we heal by bringing it into the light.

613
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,500
 My son, we went on a camp out a few weeks ago, and he came back,

614
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
 and he had all these different stickers that were in his feet,

615
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
 and he had splinters basically as a result of it,

616
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 and they were causing little infections.

617
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
 And as a five-year-old, you don't really understand that,

618
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,500
 but he said, "I need to take these tweezers and pull those out."

619
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
 Because in his mind, he's just like, "Oh, I'm okay.

620
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
 I can live the rest of my life without these things.

621
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
 It'll be fine."

622
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,500
 But in my mind, I know it's not going to get better until you get it out.

623
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 And the same is true with sin,

624
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
 that it doesn't get better in your life and in my life until it gets out.

625
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,500
 And God's not up there being like, "Man, own up, because I just want you to be embarrassed."

626
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
 He's going, "I care about what sin does to you and to me,

627
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 and I want you to experience healing."

628
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
 So sin always has consequences.

629
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 And then the second thing, very simply,

630
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 is that God always keeps his covenants.

631
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,500
 This ultimately is a story about God.

632
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,500
 I mean, if you're reading this story and you go,

633
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,500
 "Why did God not strike him with lightning?"

634
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,500
 I mean, the number of things that David does that other kings didn't do that were removed for.

635
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 I mean, Saul, you know why Saul was removed as king?

636
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,500
 He took a census, and he didn't kill somebody.

637
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
 David kills somebody after he sleeps with his wife,

638
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
 and you would think that God would be up there and be like, "Okay, we're going to move."

639
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
 David gives them every reason in the world to say,

640
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 "I'm actually not going to keep that covenant with you."

641
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
 I remember being in seminary, and this really messing with me,

642
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 because you read the Old Testament, and we don't have time to go into these stories,

643
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:57,500
 but Hezekiah, he lights basically a candle, and God removes him from authority, or brings consequences.

644
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 There's just men who do things where you're like,

645
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:12,500
 "Why would God say, 'Deal breaker, but David does the worst of anybody in the family line of Jesus, and he's your boy?'"

646
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,500
 And it wasn't until recently I realized why.

647
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
 Because God keeps His covenants.

648
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
 It wasn't about David.

649
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 You know what a covenant is? It's an unconditional promise.

650
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,500
 That regardless of what you do, I'm going to keep my promise.

651
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
 Now, does that mean sin doesn't have consequences? No.

652
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
 Sin always has consequences.

653
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,500
 You can have sex with her. That doesn't mean you're going to go to hell.

654
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,500
 It may mean you get herpes, but you're not going to hell.

655
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,500
 If you are in the covenant family of God,

656
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
 because people say, "Oh man, there's going to be consequences. Does He remove?"

657
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,500
 No. You can murder someone, and it doesn't mean you're necessarily going to hell.

658
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
 You're probably going to jail.

659
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,500
 But if you're in Christ, which would be an unusual behavior for a follower of Jesus,

660
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,500
 but God always keeps His covenant, and Matthew is highlighting the point.

661
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,500
 The relationship you and I have been invited to with God has nothing to do with how you behave.

662
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,500
 You can no longer approach Him based on that.

663
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,500
 It has everything to do with the covenant God has entered into with us.

664
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,500
 The unconditional promise. What is the unconditional promise?

665
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 Whosoever, John 3, verse 16, the most famous verse in the room, anybody probably knows.

666
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,500
 Whoever believes in Jesus will not perish but have eternal life.

667
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,500
 Not whoever behaves for Jesus will not perish but have eternal life.

668
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
 The moment Jesus taught, His followers taught, the church has always taught,

669
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,500
 when you believe, you accept Jesus on the cross died for your sin.

670
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:56,500
 Everything, stuff you don't even know you're going to do in March of 2023, paid for.

671
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
 When you accept Jesus, you on the cross, you paid for me.

672
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,500
 You died in my place, and you rose again as payment for my sin.

673
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:10,500
 Boom. You're in the covenant family of God, and our God keeps His covenant.

674
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 The covenant is an unconditional promise.

675
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,500
 The reason why David was not removed from the throne despite failure after failure

676
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,500
 is God keeps His promises.

677
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,500
 He has promised to you and I in Christ,

678
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,500
 there is nothing you can do that would make Him remove you from the covenant of God

679
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
 or the family of God.

680
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,500
 There's nothing you could not do that would keep you out of it

681
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,500
 if you receive and accept Jesus' payment on the cross for you.

682
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
 What do I mean by covenant contract?

683
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,500
 A contract is something where it's like, basically, if you do this, then I'll do that.

684
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 A contract is what I have with AT&T, where if I can get a better deal, better service,

685
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
 I would move very quickly to Verizon or whatever other service.

686
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
 That's contract.

687
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,500
 A covenant is akin to marriage.

688
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
 It's an unconditional promise.

689
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
 Next week is my wife and I's nine-year anniversary.

690
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
 Nine years ago, almost to the day.

691
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
 Yeah, thank you for that.

692
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
 Thank you.

693
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
 Golf clap for that.

694
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 Nine years ago, almost to the day, we stood at an altar, her in a white dress,

695
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:15,500
 me in a black suit and said, "I promise unconditionally to love you until death do we part."

696
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,500
 God has entered into a covenant with anyone who will simply accept Jesus

697
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,500
 and the message of David and the reason Matthew, as he's writing out,

698
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,500
 "And David was the father of Solomon,

699
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,500
 whose mother had been another man's wife,"

700
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,500
 is to highlight our God keeps his promises

701
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
 and the behavior of the people who know him and walk with him

702
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
 has nothing to do with the faithfulness of God.

703
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
 He is faithful when they are not.

704
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,500
 He is a covenant-keeping, promise-keeping God.

705
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:59,500
 And Matthew includes to point that all of these men are sinners that led to a Savior.

706
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
 Their lives point not to the heroics of themselves,

707
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,500
 but their desperate need for a Savior.

708
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,500
 That's the point in every turn of David's story.

709
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,500
 And if David was here, he'd say, "It's not about me. It's about Jesus."

710
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,500
 If Rahab was here, she would say, "It's not about me. It's about Jesus."

711
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,500
 It all points and was meant to point to him.

712
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
 Finally, David models something that's really, really important.

713
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,500
 Some of you guys in the room, you feel like, "Man, you're in an affair.

714
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,500
 You never told anybody that, but you've had one. You're in the middle of one.

715
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,500
 There's an abortion that you don't even really want to have, but someone was a part of that.

716
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
 They kind of make it seem like it's not that big of a deal.

717
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
 It's a morning-after pill, and who cares?

718
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
 It'd be worse to bring the child into this."

719
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,500
 And you made a decision, and it's haunted you every day since then.

720
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
 And you carry around a guilt and a shame.

721
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,500
 Maybe there's a current struggle that you, candidly, you think you're going to die with.

722
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 You think you're going to bring it to the grave.

723
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
 You think there's no option but to bring it to the grave.

724
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
 You think if I brought it into the light like David felt, there's no way.

725
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,500
 The confession consequences are going to be way worse than if I just keep going.

726
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,500
 And David would invite you.

727
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
 You can be free.

728
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
 You can experience healing.

729
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:24,500
 You can experience soul forgiveness, washed, in his words, "white as snow,"

730
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
 by bringing that to God.

731
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,500
 Right after he committed adultery with Bathsheba, he says in Psalm 51,

732
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,500
 he writes, and I'm laying on the plane right here, he writes something incredibly beautiful.

733
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,500
 Maybe the night after Nathan said, "You are the man."

734
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
 Psalm 51 starts like this.

735
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,500
 "A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him,

736
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba.

737
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,500
 'I know my transgressions,' David said.

738
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
 'My sin is always in front of me.

739
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
 I know I am messed up.

740
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
 But I will be clean.

741
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,500
 Wash me, God, and I will be whiter than snow.'"

742
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,500
 You do not delight in sacrifice or in good deeds or in church attendance

743
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
 or in reading my Bible or in giving to church.

744
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
 You don't delight in those things or I would give it.

745
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,500
 Those are not the things that God wants.

746
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:25,500
 The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart.

747
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,500
 God, you will not despise.

748
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,500
 And David cries out to God, "I am broken.

749
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
 Will you forgive me?"

750
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,500
 If there was something I could do that would earn it, I would do it, but there isn't.

751
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
 Will you forgive me?

752
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
 And if you will follow in David's steps tonight,

753
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:50,500
 what you will experience rushing in is the forgiveness of God.

754
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,500
 And your life doesn't have to be defined by those things.

755
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
 And if you've trusted in Jesus,

756
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,500
 no matter where you are in the spectrum for the rest of your life,

757
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,500
 you could rest confidently where you're going to spend eternity with God

758
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
 because you're part of the covenant family.

759
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 And our God keeps his covenants, his promise,

760
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,500
 his unconditional promise to those who are in Jesus.

761
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
 Let me pray.

762
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
 Father, I thank you for every person here.

763
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
 And I pray that you would allow the story of David,

764
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
 the truth that all of us are broken and in need of a Savior

765
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,500
 to pierce through anyone who has never heard, believed, accepted that.

766
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,500
 And you would welcome them into the covenant relationship

767
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,500
 that you have invited everyone who's ever lived into.

768
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,500
 And that you would pierce through people who believe lies right now.

769
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,500
 They feel like they're overwhelmed with shame and guilt.

770
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:54,500
 That your forgiveness would flood their hearts and their minds

771
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
 and bring freedom and peace.

772
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
 A freedom and peace that only you can give.

773
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
 We worship you in song. Amen.
