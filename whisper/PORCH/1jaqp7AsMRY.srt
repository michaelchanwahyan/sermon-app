 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:29,800
 Do it, porch.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,300
 Welcome.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,240
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,140
 Wow.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,880
 OK, OK.

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,760
 Wow.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,400
 OK.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,200
 For those who don't know, I've been gone for like two months.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,320
 That's a warning, actually.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,200
 I have no idea what's up with this mouth.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,360
 Holy Ghost has been doing all sorts of stuff to me.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,080
 But I'm so excited, so thankful to be here.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,480
 I'm JD, if we haven't met.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,600
 And I just want to give a quick welcome, as always,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,440
 to some Porch Live locations.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,960
 Tuning in, please help me welcome Porch Boise, Porch

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,800
 North Houston, and Porch Cincinnati watching

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,680
 in the house tonight.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,200
 And of course, my friends in Dallas, welcome.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,560
 So glad that you are all here.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,280
 We are jumping into a new series tonight called Scandals,

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,560
 where we are looking at some of the most crazy, scandalous

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,720
 stories in the Bible that are actually

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,600
 part of the ancestral tree, the family tree, you could say,

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,160
 of Jesus, the Savior of the world.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,400
 We're looking at the sinners that

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,480
 make up our Savior that we worship and love today.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,880
 It is crazy.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,120
 But before we get to that, talking about family,

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
 we are heading into the holidays,

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
 where we have Thanksgiving coming up, Christmas.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
 We're about to be spending more time, some of us,

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 than we'd like with extended family.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,960
 And I have this tradition every year, where my family--

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
 actually, my mom's side celebrates Thanksgiving

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,120
 the weekend before Thanksgiving.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
 And so that way, everyone can for sure be there.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,280
 And then they can go to everyone else's Thanksgiving

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
 on the actual day.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,240
 And I always do this thing where I take three to four friends

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,640
 with me to my family's Thanksgiving.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,040
 I just am like, you have to come witness this.

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
 This is insane, what takes place at these events.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
 My family is absolutely crazy.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,320
 And I love them for it.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 But something that I do every single time

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
 is, while we were driving there, I give them the lowdown.

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
 I'm like, OK, first, you're going

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,440
 to meet my cousin so-and-so.

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,200
 Won't say their names.

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
 I won't put them out there like that.

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
 But I tell them, this is so-and-so.

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
 I tell them all about them.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
 Then I'm like, then you'll meet Uncle Bubba.

56
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,040
 I will put him out there.

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,720
 Uncle Bubba, here's what he likes,

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,440
 and here's what he does, and drinks,

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
 and all these different things.

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
 And then you've got Aunt so-and-so,

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,880
 and all these different people.

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,280
 And then you've got my crazy grandmother and all this stuff.

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,880
 And I explain them, because I'm kind of like, proud.

64
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,040
 But I'm also kind of warning them what's to come,

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,720
 so no one's super shocked when they see all these things.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,240
 And the reality is, I tell them a lot of the funny stuff

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,720
 or the dramatic stories, but I for sure

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 leave out the things that are a part of what you could say

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,240
 makes up our family drama.

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
 And I'm sure that most of you can

71
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
 identify with family drama.

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,760
 And it just seems like every family,

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,160
 there is something going on.

74
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,400
 There is no such thing as a perfect family.

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,480
 And what we're going to see here tonight

76
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,160
 is that even though I don't share,

77
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,040
 I kind of conceal all of my family drama

78
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,360
 in front of my friends, Matthew does the exact opposite,

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
 which is his family.

80
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,760
 He puts all the drama out there.

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,240
 Because what we're going to do is we're going to look

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
 at Matthew chapter one.

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,880
 And if you don't know a little bit of context,

84
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,640
 this is really, really important.

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,720
 A lot of times when you open up the book of Matthew,

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,880
 you skip over probably the first paragraph

87
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,620
 because there's a bunch of really hard names

88
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,160
 that you can't pronounce.

89
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,360
 And that list of names is actually super, super important.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,940
 And Matthew did it for a reason,

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,440
 because he knows that if you're a good Jew

92
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,160
 reading at this time, every single one of these names,

93
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,120
 behind every single one of these names is a story.

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
 And I think when we think about the family tree of Jesus,

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
 Jesus being perfect,

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,920
 we think that the people that make up Jesus's family

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,520
 were probably really good people, really moral people,

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,940
 probably came from a wealthy family.

99
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,120
 But if you're a Jew reading this

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,880
 and you have studied books like Genesis and Exodus

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
 and Leviticus and Numbers

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,520
 and the books they had at the time when this was written,

103
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
 you would know that it's actually the opposite.

104
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,660
 That by Matthew listing out these names in Matthew 1

105
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,620
 that lead up to the Savior that is Jesus,

106
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,720
 by listing out the names of his great, great, great,

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,560
 great, great, great, great, great, great grandparents,

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,160
 what he is doing is airing out

109
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,020
 all of Jesus's family drama.

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,480
 And that's why we're calling this series "Scandals,"

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,240
 because most people don't venture into the Old Testament.

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
 First off, because it's just really hard to read.

113
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,420
 Sometimes it can be confusing.

114
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,840
 It can be intimidating to keep up with.

115
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,160
 But when you actually start trying to dive in,

116
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,760
 you start reading stories that you're like,

117
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,840
 "How is this in the, in the butt?"

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,780
 You start turning red.

119
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,000
 You're like, "What am I reading?"

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,480
 Okay, back to like, I don't know, 1 Peter.

121
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,120
 And you go back to the New Testament

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,920
 because there is some really intense stuff happening

123
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,380
 in the Old Testament.

124
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,680
 And we wanna tackle these stories

125
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,480
 because we want you guys to know

126
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,120
 that there's nothing that God cannot do.

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,740
 If you don't learn anything else from this series,

128
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,080
 what I hope that you take away

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,760
 after every one of these messages

130
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,520
 is that there is nothing impossible with our God.

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,360
 It sounds simple, but it is so true.

132
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,880
 And if Christians would believe that,

133
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,320
 it would change everything about how they live.

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
 And when you look at these stories,

135
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,840
 I hope you like reality TV

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
 because this puts the Kardashians to shame,

137
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
 I'm telling you.

138
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
 So you can kind of consider it

139
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,720
 not like the pilot of the series,

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,820
 like setting up the story,

141
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,200
 the narrative that's gonna lead us

142
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,320
 through the Old Testament to Jesus.

143
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,260
 'Cause I don't know if y'all know this,

144
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,440
 but in the very beginning of your Bible,

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,200
 in Genesis chapter three,

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,520
 there's this moment where God,

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,320
 Adam and Eve had just eaten the fruit,

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,380
 they sinned, begun the fall of mankind,

149
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,480
 and God comes down and he curses Adam, Eve, and Satan.

150
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,200
 And he does this thing where he predicts

151
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
 for the first time the gospel.

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,960
 He promises the coming of Jesus to the world.

153
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,400
 And he says in Genesis chapter three to Satan

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,240
 that one day there's gonna become an offspring from Eve

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
 that's going to crush your head,

156
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,820
 which we know now is defeating Satan,

157
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,140
 defeating sin once and for all.

158
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,980
 And this is why you have to know your Old Testament.

159
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,420
 Because if you watch the narrative of the Old Testament,

160
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,700
 and when you read these names in Matthew,

161
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,860
 what Matthew is doing is so genius.

162
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,020
 He's saying, let me tell you

163
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,140
 about the Savior you're about to read about.

164
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,420
 He is the product of God being faithful to his promise,

165
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,980
 despite all circumstances.

166
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,100
 Despite an unfaithful people,

167
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,220
 God was faithful to his promise.

168
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,380
 Look at these names.

169
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,700
 They are what prove that God is faithful to his promise.

170
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,780
 And the whole Old Testament is tracking these names

171
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,720
 and watching how God brings about Jesus to the world.

172
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,500
 So before you read about Jesus in Matthew, Mark, Luke,

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,620
 and John, learn about where he came from.

174
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,460
 And that's what we're gonna do in this series.

175
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,880
 And so just starting in Matthew chapter one,

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,500
 I'm only gonna read three verses tonight,

177
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,180
 and then we'll keep on going in the rest of the series.

178
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,460
 It says, "This is a record of the ancestors

179
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,460
 of Jesus the Messiah, a descendant of David and of Abraham.

180
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,060
 Abraham was the father of Isaac.

181
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,600
 Isaac was the father of Jacob.

182
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,860
 Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.

183
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,900
 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah,

184
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,300
 whose mother was Tamar."

185
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,520
 Now, if you are, like I said, a Jew reading this

186
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,180
 at this time, you're like, hold up,

187
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,700
 Judah and Tamar, that's Jesus' great, great,

188
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,860
 great grandparents, 'cause that story's crazy.

189
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,580
 Because you know that in Genesis chapter 38

190
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,320
 is one of the most scandalous stories in all the Bible.

191
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,100
 And we're gonna get to that really soon.

192
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
 But I want you to know that behind every single one

193
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,460
 of these names, like I said, is a story.

194
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,820
 For most, it's a really, really messed up story.

195
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,420
 But the reality is, is that should be weirdly comforting

196
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,400
 because behind every single one of your names tonight,

197
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
 I know is a story.

198
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
 Every single person in this here tonight, you have a story.

199
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,400
 You have something that makes up who you are.

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,840
 You've probably been through really hard things.

201
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,680
 You've been through really crazy circumstances

202
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,540
 and trials and situations.

203
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,860
 You've done things that maybe you are not proud of.

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,660
 And I know that behind every single one

205
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,780
 of your names is a story.

206
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,740
 And I believe that some of you tonight,

207
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,020
 Jesus wants to set free because you think

208
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,560
 that your story is worthless.

209
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,540
 You think your story is too messed up.

210
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,600
 You think that you are too far gone.

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,980
 And so this is what this message is about.

212
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,880
 This is who this series is for.

213
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,740
 It's for the person who believes that they are disqualified

214
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,380
 from being used and loved by God.

215
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,580
 It's for the person who is maybe out

216
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,740
 on this whole Christian thing,

217
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,620
 or they're out on God.

218
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,140
 Sure, he's a good thing, but we're not really tight like

219
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,540
 that or I'm not one of those Jesus freaks.

220
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,380
 You're out on God because when you look

221
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,060
 at your circumstances or your heartbreak or your trials,

222
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,060
 you believe that God must be out on you.

223
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,580
 It's for the person that believes that guilt

224
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,300
 and shame will rule their life forever

225
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,680
 because their sin is too great.

226
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,940
 The gap between them and God is too far

227
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,460
 and they'll never be able to fully catch up

228
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,620
 and be near to him.

229
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,740
 That's who this message is for

230
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,260
 because that's simply not true.

231
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,900
 And you're gonna see that tonight.

232
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,780
 If you don't take notes,

233
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,700
 if you don't walk away with anything else,

234
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,340
 here is the thesis of this message.

235
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,140
 Here's what I hope tonight, if someone says to you,

236
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
 "Hey, what was the message about tonight?"

237
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,140
 Here's what I hope you take away.

238
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,180
 God uses sinful people to execute his perfect plan.

239
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,180
 God uses sinful people to execute his perfect plan.

240
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,540
 And we're gonna see that played out by zeroing in

241
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,000
 on the story of Judah and Tamar.

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,940
 So buckle up 'cause it gets heated.

243
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,220
 So, like I said, reading the Old Testament can be hard

244
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
 and sometimes these names can get confusing.

245
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,500
 And so a practice that we've done around here

246
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,400
 is we have put the names of the Old Testament

247
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,020
 to kind of more like relevant characters

248
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,540
 that you might be able to identify with.

249
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,180
 So I thought I would help us out.

250
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,660
 Let's take Judah.

251
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,540
 And I'm sorry if you have watched "The Greatest Showman,"

252
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,060
 this is gonna ruin everything for you.

253
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,460
 Judah is Hugh Jackman, okay?

254
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,740
 And what we're gonna see in this story

255
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,460
 before we get there, a little bit of setup,

256
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,740
 is Hugh is gonna marry his girl, Shuwa.

257
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,660
 All right, we got Judah and Shuwa, all right?

258
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,060
 So they're married, everything's going great

259
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,900
 until they have three sons who are just awful

260
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,740
 for whatever reason.

261
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,340
 We got Ur, Zac Efron, who else we got?

262
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,660
 Onan as Jafar.

263
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,000
 And Shalom from Josh as Drake and Josh.

264
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,600
 And so Shalom, Sheila, whatever you wanna call him,

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
 I don't really know, that's the point.

266
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,520
 And you'll see if you keep reading why I picked Jafar,

267
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,640
 he just, Onan reminds me of a Jafar character,

268
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
 I don't know why.

269
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,360
 But what's happening is, is Judah,

270
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,200
 who we are kind of emphasizing this story is about,

271
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,900
 was a son of Jacob.

272
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
 Jacob had 12 sons.

273
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,000
 And you might remember Judah from the story of Joseph.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,200
 Joseph gets a big chunk of the book of Genesis.

275
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
 And there's this really weird moment that happens

276
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,280
 where right before Joseph,

277
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
 or right after Joseph is given dreams,

278
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,400
 his brothers get really jealous.

279
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,680
 And Judah is the guy who comes up with the idea of saying,

280
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
 "Let's not kill him, let's throw him into slavery.

281
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
 "Let's sell him and get some money."

282
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,520
 And then Judah goes back to their father, Jacob,

283
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
 and says, "Your son's been murdered, we're so sorry."

284
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,160
 That's what Judah does, that's who Judah is, okay?

285
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,280
 And so then out of nowhere, the story of Joseph stops.

286
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,260
 And in chapter 38 of Genesis,

287
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,600
 we like go in on Judah's life,

288
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,500
 post making that decision to sell his brother,

289
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
 his own blood into slavery.

290
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,000
 And it seems like his guilt and shame

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,380
 has led him to quite the place here.

292
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,320
 'Cause this is a really, really crazy situation

293
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
 we're about to read about.

294
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,520
 And so they have these three kids,

295
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,100
 Ur, Onan, and Shelah, let's call Josh Shelah.

296
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,240
 And they're like, "Okay, let's get a wife for our oldest son."

297
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,940
 And so they get Ur, a wife named Tamar, Zendaya,

298
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,600
 who's even beautiful with pink hair.

299
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,540
 And so they get married,

300
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,660
 but we find out that Ur is a bad guy, so he dies.

301
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,280
 So then naturally in this culture and in this time,

302
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,740
 they say, "Okay, let's give Tamar the next son in line,

303
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,240
 "which is Jafar."

304
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,080
 Onan, come to find out, as we all know, he's a villain,

305
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,340
 he's wicked, so then he dies.

306
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,440
 And then after Onan dies, we have Josh.

307
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,100
 The problem is, is Josh is way too young and he's Josh.

308
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,140
 And so he's really, really young.

309
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,100
 And Judah says, "Hey, one day I will allow you

310
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,720
 "to marry Shelah," in the Bible, not Josh,

311
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,180
 "when he's of age."

312
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,680
 And so Tamar's like, "Fine."

313
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,520
 And Tamar moves back in with her own dad

314
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,000
 and she waits for him to become of age.

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,340
 And that's where we pick up in the story.

316
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,760
 If you would look at me at Genesis, with me,

317
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
 Genesis 38, verse 11.

318
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,780
 Genesis 38, verse 11.

319
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,620
 Here we go.

320
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:37,680
 "Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law,

321
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,120
 "go back to your parents' home and remain a widow

322
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,620
 "until my son Shelah is old enough to marry you.

323
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,500
 "But Judah didn't really intend to do this

324
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,060
 "because he was afraid Shelah would also die,

325
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,440
 "like his two brothers."

326
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
 So you know what's happening?

327
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,440
 Judah's like, "Well, you kind of have this curse

328
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,940
 "about you, Tamar, where every time I give you

329
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,840
 "one of my sons, they die.

330
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,640
 "And so I'm not gonna do it,

331
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,980
 "but I'll just kind of like keep you happy

332
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,380
 "and think in a lot of time you'll get to marry him."

333
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,420
 So pretty much Josh is dead to Tamar.

334
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,700
 So Josh, out of the picture.

335
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,740
 And so Tamar went back to live in her father's home,

336
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,820
 verse 12.

337
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,820
 "Some years later, years later, Judah's wife died.

338
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,580
 "So now Shua, gone.

339
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,700
 "Shua is out of the story.

340
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,700
 "And all we have left is Judah and Tamar."

341
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,400
 Father-in-law, daughter-in-law, a disaster.

342
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,240
 So,

343
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,160
 someone told Tamar, we're in verse 13,

344
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,560
 "Look, your father-in-law, Judah,

345
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,720
 "is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."

346
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,560
 So wife died, went through a hard time.

347
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
 Now it's time to like take his mind off of it,

348
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,420
 shear his sheep.

349
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,460
 And so he's going up to Timnah, as one does.

350
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,460
 And Tamar was aware that Shelah had grown up.

351
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,800
 So he's grown now.

352
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
 He's of age to marry,

353
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,680
 but no arrangements had been made

354
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
 for her to come and marry him.

355
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,480
 So she changed, this is where it gets really weird.

356
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
 "She changed out of her widow's clothing

357
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,380
 "and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself.

358
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,120
 "Then she sat beside the road at the entrance

359
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,200
 "to the village of Enam, which is on the road to Timnah."

360
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
 So Judah with the sheep heading to shear

361
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
 on the road to Timnah.

362
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,760
 He walks through this place called Enam,

363
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,860
 looks over a beautiful lady in a veil.

364
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,440
 I guess veils were attractive

365
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
 'cause you know what I mean?

366
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
 So that's all he sees.

367
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 So then Judah noticed her and thought she was a prostitute

368
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,220
 since she had covered her face.

369
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,240
 Remember, this is his daughter-in-law,

370
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,080
 thought she was a prostitute.

371
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,320
 So he stopped and propositioned her,

372
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,440
 "Let me have sex with you,"

373
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
 which I'm like, what a great pick up line.

374
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,200
 (congregation laughing)

375
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,540
 I think sadly some guys think that works today.

376
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,360
 So, "Let me have sex with you," he said.

377
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,160
 Not realizing that she was his own daughter-in-law.

378
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,020
 She then says, this is where it gets scandy.

379
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,620
 She says, "Well, how much will you pay to have sex with me?"

380
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,800
 I read this and I'm like.

381
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,240
 "Tamar asked, 'I'll send you a young goat from my flock.'"

382
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,920
 Young goats, nice.

383
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,580
 "Judah promised, 'But what will you give me

384
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,080
 "'to guarantee that you will send the goat?'"

385
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 'Cause she has trust issues now at this point,

386
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,360
 as most women do.

387
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,160
 And so she's asking for collateral.

388
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
 You know, the whole like,

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,400
 "Hey, I'm gonna come back and pay you,

390
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,120
 "well, let me keep your watch or your car until then."

391
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
 She's asking for some collateral.

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
 So here's what he says.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,960
 Where are we at?

394
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
 Here we go, verse 18.

395
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,040
 "Well, what kind of guarantee do you want?"

396
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
 He replied, she answered,

397
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
 "Leave me your identification seal,"

398
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
 so basically like the modern day ID,

399
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
 "and its cord and the walking stick you are carrying."

400
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,840
 So Judah gave them to her.

401
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,040
 Then he had intercourse with her.

402
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,920
 And she became pregnant.

403
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,220
 Afterwards, she went back home, took off her veil,

404
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,640
 and put on her widow's clothing as usual.

405
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
 As usual.

406
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,000
 And so after they did the freaky,

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,800
 Judah goes on, shears his sheep,

408
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,980
 and then he comes back,

409
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,000
 and here's what we see happen.

410
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
 I'm just gonna paraphrase it for us,

411
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,220
 we don't have time to read it all.

412
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,320
 Basically, he gets back home,

413
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,800
 and he like hits up his boy.

414
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,480
 I think his name's like Haram or,

415
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
 yeah, Haram.

416
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,560
 And he says, "Yo, I need you.

417
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,760
 "I can't go back there.

418
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,080
 "Like I have that, like I feel bad about myself,

419
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,160
 "hooked up with a prostitute,

420
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
 "but would you be a homie, take this goat,

421
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,160
 "I promised her a goat, get my stuff back,

422
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,620
 "bring it back, 'cause I don't want people seeing me

423
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,040
 "like this out in the streets with the girls

424
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
 "and all this stuff."

425
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,760
 And his friend's like, "Yeah, I'll take the goat.

426
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,600
 "I'll get your stuff."

427
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,680
 And so, he's a bro, he takes the goat,

428
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,160
 and he goes, and he asked the guys

429
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,720
 at the edge of the place,

430
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,740
 "Hey, where's the prostitute,

431
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,640
 "the local prostitute?"

432
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
 And they're like, "Well, we're fresh out of,

433
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,060
 "we don't have those.

434
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,480
 "There's no, there's no prostitutes here.

435
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
 "We haven't seen those."

436
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,280
 And he's like, "Huh, Judah is gonna get a kick out of this."

437
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,420
 And so, he goes back, and he tells Judah,

438
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,180
 "Hey, like, there is no, I searched everywhere,

439
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,960
 "there's no prostitutes."

440
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,700
 And basically, Judah's like, "She can keep the hoodie,

441
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,580
 "like, she can keep my stuff.

442
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,240
 "I'm not trying to seem desperate,

443
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
 "I'm not trying to seem needy,

444
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,720
 "I'm not trying to get laughed at."

445
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,680
 He has this huge fear of man complex,

446
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,920
 he won't go back, he's ashamed,

447
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,260
 and he's like, "She can keep it,

448
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,480
 "let me wipe my hands clean."

449
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,520
 And just when he thinks he is out,

450
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
 like, just when he thinks,

451
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,440
 and like, guys, you never get out, all right?

452
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,160
 It always finds you.

453
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,080
 He thinks he's in the clear,

454
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,800
 no one knows I did this thing,

455
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,960
 I was in a bad place, my wife just died,

456
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,140
 all these different things,

457
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,220
 and then this happens, verse 24.

458
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,500
 Whew, this is the moment in the show where everyone's like.

459
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,800
 About three months later,

460
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,940
 Judah was told, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law,

461
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,540
 "has acted like a prostitute,

462
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,500
 "and now because of this, she's pregnant."

463
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,140
 Judah's response, "Bring her out and let her be burned."

464
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,120
 He just hooked up with a prostitute,

465
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,200
 comes back, thinks his daughter-in-law,

466
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,840
 who he's been, by the way, like, lying to,

467
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,260
 and keeping out to dry,

468
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,980
 thinks she's now gotten pregnant,

469
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,700
 and now his first response is to burn her,

470
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
 he wants to burn his daughter-in-law, okay?

471
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,380
 Light her on fire.

472
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,180
 Verse 25, "But as they were taking her out to kill her,"

473
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,100
 she's a smart girl,

474
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,140
 "she sent this message to her father-in-law,

475
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,780
 "the man who owns these things made me pregnant."

476
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,120
 Look closely, I love that ad, look closely.

477
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,940
 (congregation laughing)

478
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,780
 Is that my?

479
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,340
 Does that say Judah?

480
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,140
 You know, he sits back.

481
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,520
 "Whose sealing cord and walking stick are these, Judah?"

482
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,780
 So she asked.

483
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,380
 Judah recognized, he knew he messed up.

484
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,380
 Judah recognized, and immediately, and said,

485
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,300
 "She is more righteous than I am,

486
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,540
 "because I didn't arrange for her to marry my son,

487
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,180
 "she liked, I said I would,

488
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,940
 "and Judah never slept with Tamar again."

489
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,700
 We go to see, that's good, way to go.

490
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,180
 Judah, what a good guy, right?

491
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,380
 That's so good, so noble.

492
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,060
 And then we see the rest of the chapter,

493
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,680
 it says that Tamar gives birth to twins.

494
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,960
 There's this weird situation where one's like coming out,

495
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,980
 and then like, it goes back in,

496
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,860
 and then like the other one gets in front of it.

497
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,740
 You girls are like, "What?"

498
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,060
 And gets in front of it, and then that one comes out,

499
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,460
 and then Perez, out of the two twins,

500
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,380
 their names are Perez and Zarah,

501
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,060
 Perez continues the lineage we see in Matthew of Jesus.

502
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,500
 This is the story, these are the people,

503
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,260
 these are the types of things that God uses

504
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,180
 to point to the savior of the world.

505
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,660
 Because you might read this and think,

506
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,100
 how in the world is a father-in-law

507
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,860
 hooking up with the fake prostitute daughter-in-law

508
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,460
 had to do anything with us tonight?

509
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,140
 Like when you read this story, I'm thinking,

510
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,220
 who's the hero, who's the good guy?

511
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,820
 Who's the example to follow?

512
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
 Who's like Jesus?

513
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,020
 And I think that's kind of the point, no one is.

514
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,140
 These stories are really messed up people,

515
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,380
 really sinful people in need of a savior.

516
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,420
 That's how this relates to you and I,

517
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,900
 is we're not perfect.

518
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,020
 I think we think the Bible is about a bunch of perfect people

519
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,780
 trying to live a perfect life for a perfect God.

520
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,820
 That's not the story at all.

521
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,100
 It's a bunch of really broken, messed up people

522
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,500
 in need of a perfect savior to come and save them.

523
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,420
 That's the whole narrative of scripture

524
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,940
 is really, really broken people.

525
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,460
 So this story is way more applicable

526
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,900
 to every single one of us than we wanna believe.

527
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,180
 You may not have prostituted yourself.

528
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,620
 You may not have tried to burn somebody to death,

529
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,660
 but you have been dead in your sin.

530
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,980
 You have been in desperate need of a savior.

531
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,900
 And if God can take something like Judah and Tamar,

532
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,220
 if Matthew can think it is worth adding it

533
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,620
 to the book of the Bible to recall these people and say,

534
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,500
 hey, these are the ancestors of Jesus.

535
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,980
 It's like Matthew wants us to see, hey, I'm not ashamed.

536
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,540
 This is what God does.

537
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,380
 He takes broken things and makes them complete.

538
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,140
 He takes sinful people and he uses them to point

539
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,900
 to the savior, the coming Messiah.

540
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,100
 And you're gonna see in this series, "Scandals,"

541
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,260
 that God takes these really, really scandalous stories,

542
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,180
 these really, really sinful people

543
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,700
 and he doesn't try to make them good.

544
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,340
 No, he shows how good he is through them,

545
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,220
 how faithful he is through them.

546
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,660
 And he wants to do the same with us tonight.

547
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,300
 Do you realize that in this story alone,

548
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
 we see that Judah threw his own brothers

549
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,780
 into slavery for money.

550
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,300
 He lies to his dad about it.

551
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,580
 He raises three wicked sons.

552
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,700
 He lies to his daughter-in-law.

553
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,540
 Tamar fakes a prostitute.

554
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,220
 Judah sleeps with his daughter-in-law,

555
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,300
 struggles with fear of man is embarrassed.

556
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,380
 Judah almost burns her alive.

557
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,860
 And yet these are the type of people that God says,

558
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,660
 "Yeah, I'm gonna use you to point to Jesus.

559
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,580
 "I'm gonna bring Jesus to the world through your lineage,

560
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,340
 "through your offspring."

561
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,980
 So if God, my question tonight is,

562
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,140
 if God can use them to bring Jesus to the world,

563
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,580
 what makes you think that he cannot use you to do the same?

564
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,100
 He wants to use you to bring Jesus to the world today

565
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,940
 because Jesus is very much alive in our world,

566
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,180
 just like the people of this time

567
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,780
 are very much in need of a savior.

568
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,980
 But they need people who will use their story

569
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,780
 to proclaim his glory to the world.

570
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,540
 But you have to see that God wants to use you.

571
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,380
 And I think a lot of times we live this life in fear

572
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,180
 or we think, "No, it's up to that guy,"

573
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,900
 or, "It's up to them," or, "I'm just not that person,"

574
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,700
 or, "Man, if only you knew where I come from."

575
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,600
 It doesn't matter.

576
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,060
 What I want y'all to believe tonight

577
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,220
 is there is no one too far gone.

578
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,980
 There is no one disqualified

579
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,060
 because God is the only one qualified.

580
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,100
 And he is the one that makes moves.

581
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,820
 He is the one that does miracles.

582
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,700
 But if you are here tonight, you are a miracle

583
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,900
 and you have an opportunity to be used and loved by God.

584
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,060
 And he has done so much.

585
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,900
 He has gone through so many links for you to know that.

586
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,880
 Tonight, this story shows us again

587
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,580
 that God uses sinful people to execute his perfect plan.

588
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,620
 But if you're gonna be used by God,

589
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,500
 if we are gonna believe that God wants to use us,

590
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,540
 we have to believe that there is nothing impossible with him.

591
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,380
 We have to believe that he is more powerful

592
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,540
 than whatever you think is holding you back.

593
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,380
 And I think a lot of us come here

594
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,140
 and we hear things like the gospel.

595
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,740
 We hear things like, "God loves you no matter what."

596
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,580
 We're like, "Yeah, that's really good.

597
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,780
 "Thanks for the reminder."

598
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,860
 It's not a reminder, it's a reality

599
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,940
 that can change us.

600
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,900
 It's a reality that can change everything about your life.

601
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,200
 And I know sometimes we can be our worst enemies.

602
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,940
 We can be the thing in the way

603
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,380
 from God being able to use us.

604
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,980
 We can be the thing that stops us from believing

605
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,580
 that God really does love us.

606
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,060
 We can be our worst enemy.

607
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,100
 And on top of that, there is an enemy out there,

608
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,820
 Satan, who was there in the garden

609
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,080
 when God made that promise that he was gonna bring Jesus

610
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,940
 to change the world and save the world once and for all.

611
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,120
 Ever since then, he has set out on a mission

612
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,680
 to convince you that you are disqualified,

613
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,180
 that your story is too unique,

614
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,380
 that it goes further than the gospel can reach.

615
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
 And there are some of you tonight

616
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,340
 that you come here time and time again,

617
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,220
 yet nothing changes because the enemy is deceiving you.

618
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,780
 If I was the enemy and I wanted to stop young adults today

619
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,180
 from proclaiming Jesus to the world,

620
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,420
 from experiencing life and life to the full,

621
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,660
 I will do whatever it takes to cause them to believe

622
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,160
 that they are not good enough,

623
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,420
 that they are disqualified,

624
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,520
 that this might be true for her or him or them, but not you.

625
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,860
 And I think that he has two major ways

626
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,400
 that despite what we read in the story,

627
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,900
 despite what we read about God,

628
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,760
 despite what we hear time and time again here at The Porch,

629
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,040
 I believe that the enemy uses two ways to convince us

630
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,940
 that we are disqualified from being used and loved by God.

631
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,720
 I wanna talk about those two things tonight.

632
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,560
 The first one I think that he does

633
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,040
 is he convinces us that our circumstances disqualify us.

634
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,040
 He convinces us that our circumstances disqualify us

635
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,480
 from being used by God.

636
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,480
 We think that the things around us are what define us.

637
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,900
 A lot of times we self-deprecate and think,

638
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,180
 oh, well, if I just had what they had,

639
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,840
 if I was just like her, if I just looked different,

640
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,960
 if I was just in a different life season,

641
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,880
 if I was just a different age, when I'm that age,

642
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,400
 I'll start taking God more seriously.

643
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,080
 Or man, if I landed that job, if I was married,

644
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
 if my parents would not have gotten a divorce,

645
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,040
 if I had a dad around growing up, if I had more followers,

646
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,200
 if I went to that school or did that thing,

647
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
 then, then God could use me.

648
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,980
 You think your circumstances dictate God's abilities,

649
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,560
 but God should be the one dictating your circumstances

650
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,260
 in all things.

651
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,400
 But he wants you to wake up and realize it,

652
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,060
 that your circumstances are not what disqualify you.

653
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,400
 They are actually the thing that God uses to qualify you,

654
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,040
 to be used and loved by him.

655
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,080
 But you have to see them for what they are.

656
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,320
 So many of us live in this over there syndrome,

657
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,640
 this over there mentality,

658
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,500
 that if I just had what was over there, then,

659
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,300
 if I was over there, then, if I was over there, then.

660
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,160
 How long has he been saying that for?

661
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,200
 Five years, 10 years, 15 years.

662
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,140
 When are you gonna do that thing

663
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,600
 God's been calling you to do?

664
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,240
 When are you gonna stop blaming him or her or that situation

665
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
 and start trusting God?

666
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,480
 When are you gonna start thinking

667
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,400
 that you just need more resources when you have the source?

668
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,920
 When are you gonna stop letting your circumstance

669
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,220
 dictate your God?

670
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,400
 Because why would God, think about this logically,

671
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,880
 why would God give you what's over there

672
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,200
 when you are not realizing what's right here?

673
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,780
 When you're not grateful for what's right here,

674
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,760
 why would he take you over there?

675
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
 It reminded me of when I got my first car.

676
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,740
 I grew up in a podunk East Texas town.

677
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,040
 Nice cars were not a thing,

678
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,960
 but I had a really, really not nice car.

679
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
 It was actually a hand-me-down.

680
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,760
 It was my mom's car, which is even more embarrassing.

681
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,960
 It was a Malibu.

682
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,040
 And it was white, it was dirty.

683
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
 And I just remember driving to school and I was like,

684
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,120
 "Isn't that your mom's car?"

685
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,020
 And it just, I remember getting frustrated

686
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,680
 'cause some of my other friends, they got a new car.

687
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,520
 And I remember being like,

688
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
 "Dad, why didn't I get a new car when I turned 16?"

689
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
 He's like, "Son, I gotta see how you drive.

690
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,920
 I gotta see how you treat this car.

691
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,620
 I gotta see if you're reckless.

692
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,640
 I gotta see if you know how to keep it clean.

693
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,040
 I gotta see if you know how to steward this vehicle.

694
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
 Because why would I give you something new

695
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,480
 that costs me a lot more money

696
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,200
 if you are not faithful what you have right here?

697
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
 If you don't know how to drive properly

698
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,640
 and take care of what I've given you right now?"

699
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
 So many of us want the new shiny car.

700
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,480
 I remember in college, I just got all in with Jesus.

701
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,560
 I was so fired up after my freshman year.

702
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,720
 "No more of the world, God.

703
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,640
 What do you want me to do?

704
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
 What do you want me to do?"

705
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,720
 I abandoned my major, my scholarship,

706
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,540
 all these different things.

707
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,440
 I'm like, "Yeah, Jesus freak."

708
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
 And I'm feeling so on this high.

709
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,020
 I just got back from a mission trip in the Philippines.

710
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,320
 I was feeling so good.

711
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,600
 And he's like, "Leave it all.

712
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,400
 Start a Bible study in your dorm."

713
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,140
 And I'm like, "Come again?"

714
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,360
 And I'm like, "You don't want me to go lead some movement?

715
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,240
 You don't want me to go start some conference or a podcast?

716
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,040
 You want me to just start a Bible study in my dorm?"

717
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,320
 He's like, "Yeah."

718
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,160
 So I grabbed my friend.

719
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,760
 We started Bible study for the first year.

720
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,640
 An entire year, y'all, four people came.

721
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,600
 Four.

722
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
 I'm knocking on every door.

723
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,320
 "Come by, we have cookies, we have pizza."

724
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,600
 Four.

725
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 Same four.

726
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,160
 One of them played video games on his phone on loud.

727
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,200
 One of them fell asleep on a beanbag.

728
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,520
 And one of them would eat the cookies.

729
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,420
 And as soon as I said, "Okay, open up your Bibles, leave."

730
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,720
 Every time.

731
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,800
 And I'm just like, so basically I had one.

732
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
 I had one.

733
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,180
 And I just remember those moments being like,

734
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,640
 "God, how much more longer do I have to keep doing this?"

735
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,140
 He's like, "Until I tell you to stop.

736
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,420
 Will you trust me?

737
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,240
 Will you trust me with the now?

738
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,120
 Will you trust me with the here?

739
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,720
 Will you trust that I am doing something,

740
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,920
 I'm producing something in this season?

741
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,480
 Will you trust me that I'm asking you

742
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,400
 to be faithful in the here and now?"

743
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,320
 And if you had told that heavyweight, curly-headed band nerd

744
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,840
 those days in that dorm room leading a Bible study

745
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,680
 that one day he'd be teaching from the same Bible

746
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 to people his age, I would have laughed at you.

747
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,320
 'Cause I wasn't fully in with, all in with the here.

748
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,220
 I thought that over there was better.

749
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,680
 And one day God got a hold of my heart.

750
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
 And I remember just this moment with God, I was like,

751
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
 "God, if it's just four people for the rest of my life,

752
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,800
 I trust you.

753
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
 I trust you."

754
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,500
 And I also realized though that for some people,

755
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,000
 circumstances don't just look like a Bible study.

756
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,900
 They don't just look like a car.

757
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,600
 They can look like really, really hard things.

758
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,040
 And you wonder how can something be good from all of this?

759
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,640
 And I wanna remind you of a truth.

760
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,520
 To say that God cannot use you

761
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,000
 because of your circumstances around you

762
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,560
 is to simultaneously state that God made a mistake

763
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,800
 or he is not in control.

764
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,720
 Let me say it again.

765
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,000
 To say God cannot use you

766
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,520
 because of the circumstances around you

767
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,080
 is to simultaneously state that God made a mistake

768
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,680
 or he is not in control.

769
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,620
 But we know that's not true.

770
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,800
 We see it all throughout scripture.

771
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,640
 Just a few.

772
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,040
 Numbers 23, 19 said,

773
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,000
 "God is not man, so he does not lie.

774
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,240
 He is not human, so he does not change his mind.

775
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,280
 Has he ever spoken and failed to act?

776
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,160
 Has he ever promised and not carried it through?

777
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,640
 God is who he says he is.

778
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,000
 What he's put in front of you, he will complete."

779
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,440
 Philippians 4, 19 says,

780
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,680
 "My God will supply every need."

781
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
 Not want.

782
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,700
 He doesn't promise the wants,

783
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,200
 but every need of yours,

784
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,920
 according to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus.

785
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,560
 You are in this circumstance.

786
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,680
 You have faced these things

787
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,240
 because God is trying to produce something in you,

788
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,840
 a deep trust in him,

789
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,960
 so then he can work through you, so he can use you.

790
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,300
 But you keep thinking these circumstances are my God.

791
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,520
 You keep thinking these circumstances

792
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,320
 are more powerful than my God.

793
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,140
 And your circumstances are your problem.

794
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,700
 And God wants you to see

795
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,840
 that your circumstances are your solution.

796
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,720
 They're the way that you can depend on God

797
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,480
 and he can use those circumstances to change the world.

798
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,500
 Every single one of you has gone through a unique thing

799
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,760
 that makes you uniquely who you are.

800
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,600
 And God wants to use that.

801
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,340
 Y'all, I have been in deep moments of grief.

802
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,280
 I have been in deep moments of isolation,

803
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,160
 loneliness, despair,

804
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,480
 where I am crying out in my room alone,

805
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,520
 wondering, "God, how could you use death?

806
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,960
 How could you use such awful things?

807
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,360
 How could you use this sickness?

808
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,660
 How could you use this really, really hard situation

809
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,600
 for something good?

810
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,440
 How?

811
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,380
 It hurts.

812
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,280
 How can you use this circumstance?

813
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,760
 Why would you use this circumstance?"

814
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,160
 And I wanted to close my fist

815
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,200
 and not trust him and not trust him,

816
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,160
 'cause how could a good God allow that kind of pain?

817
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,620
 But over time, I slowly started to let go,

818
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,260
 trust him, learn about his character,

819
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,600
 learn about his sovereignty,

820
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,720
 how just in control he really was

821
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,740
 and how he was trying to use those circumstances

822
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,280
 to develop me, use me, show me his love.

823
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,020
 And now I get to step into people's pain with them.

824
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,280
 I get to relate to people

825
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,660
 and go to a deep place with them

826
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,440
 because I've been into a deep place with the Lord.

827
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,680
 But it started happening the day

828
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,760
 that I made him God of my circumstances,

829
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,600
 not circumstances, my God.

830
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:58,680
 Your circumstances are things that describe you,

831
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,060
 but they are not what defines you.

832
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,720
 Jesus is what defines you.

833
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,700
 Your circumstances are things that describe you,

834
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,260
 but they are not what define you.

835
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,740
 Jesus defines you.

836
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,820
 The second thing that we think disqualifies us,

837
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,720
 that the enemy, he really uses this one

838
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
 to believe that we are not capable

839
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,520
 of being used by God is our sin.

840
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,180
 The enemy often, and we often believe

841
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,700
 that our sin is what disqualifies us

842
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,240
 from being able to use by God.

843
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,880
 But I want you to remember the story

844
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,540
 that we started off with tonight,

845
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,200
 that there were people

846
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,440
 that were having sex with each other,

847
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,480
 fake prostituting themselves out,

848
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,260
 willing to kill each other,

849
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,040
 really, really awful people all throughout scripture,

850
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,440
 full of sin, yet God used them.

851
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,700
 God produced something good out of them.

852
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,160
 And if he can do that with someone like Judah and Tamar,

853
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,540
 what could he do with you?

854
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,960
 What can he do with you?

855
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,660
 That's what I want to remind you of tonight

856
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,620
 is that God is not done with you.

857
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,340
 God is not out on you.

858
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,840
 I do not care what you have done.

859
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,260
 You think, man, not me.

860
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,140
 If only you knew, if only you knew.

861
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,360
 JD, I might not know, but he does.

862
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,940
 He knows.

863
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,020
 He knows everything you've done.

864
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,480
 But Romans 5, 8 says that God demonstrates his love for us

865
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,140
 that while we were still sinners,

866
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,660
 that when he knew how Judah and Tamar would act,

867
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,020
 when he knew that you and I would sin against him

868
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,980
 while we were sinners, Christ died for us.

869
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,620
 Not after we got cleaned up.

870
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,540
 In the midst of our sin, Christ died for us.

871
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,020
 And you think because maybe you had an abortion.

872
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,060
 You think maybe because you have this crazy sexual past

873
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,960
 of addiction, or you struggle with same-sex attraction,

874
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,660
 or you have an STD, or you've cheated on someone,

875
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,340
 hooked up with someone yesterday,

876
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,600
 you stole something major at work,

877
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,140
 you're addicted to porn or drugs

878
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,200
 for the last 17, 12, 10 years.

879
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,760
 You think that that disqualifies you.

880
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,580
 But the thing about this story and every story

881
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,020
 is it points to the thing that actually qualifies you.

882
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,160
 It's Jesus.

883
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,920
 Every single one of these stories,

884
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,100
 no matter how bad, God uses to point to Jesus.

885
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,420
 And when your life intersects with Jesus, everything changes.

886
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,220
 The things that once held you back,

887
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,220
 now you are able to be set free.

888
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,540
 Second Corinthians 5, 17 says it like this.

889
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,180
 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ,

890
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,100
 anyone who would give their life to Christ

891
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,220
 has become a new person.

892
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,740
 The old life is gone, a new life has begun.

893
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,880
 The old life has gone, the new life has begun.

894
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,700
 Your past, gone.

895
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,380
 Your sins, gone.

896
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,400
 When God looks at you, he sees Jesus.

897
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,660
 That's the coolest part of all of this.

898
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,260
 It's just like God used all these really bad things

899
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,740
 to point to the savior of the world.

900
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,140
 He uses your bad things.

901
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,260
 He uses your sin to point people

902
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,020
 to the savior of the world.

903
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,540
 He uses your story to point to the story

904
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,040
 that God loved us so much that he sent Jesus to the earth

905
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,540
 to pay the price that we could not,

906
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,900
 to die on a cross, to live a perfect life,

907
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,380
 and to be the perfect sacrifice,

908
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,100
 and that his blood was shed on the cross,

909
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,620
 making atonement, making sacrifice for you and I.

910
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,620
 He died on that cross,

911
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,180
 but he did not stay dead.

912
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,020
 Three days later, he rose again,

913
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,540
 defeating death, defeating sin once and for all.

914
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,340
 God fulfilled his promise through Jesus.

915
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,420
 And in that moment, you are no longer disqualified

916
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,620
 because of your past, because of your sin.

917
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,380
 You now can live a life free.

918
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,800
 The thing that you once had to hide, you now can proclaim.

919
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,700
 You can say, "Look at me, look at my sin.

920
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,260
 "I will show you my savior."

921
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,820
 When you look at my story,

922
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,420
 you cannot look at my story now

923
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,020
 without looking at the savior who saved me.

924
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,200
 Everything changes.

925
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,300
 You get a new life in Christ.

926
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,540
 The old is gone.

927
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,880
 The new life has begun.

928
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,700
 Your sin now has become a part of your story.

929
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,140
 It is in no way the point of your story.

930
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,580
 Jesus is the point of your story.

931
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,900
 Colossians 2 says, "You were dead because of your sins,

932
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,360
 "and because of your sinful nature was not yet cut away.

933
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,220
 "Then God made you alive with Christ,

934
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,800
 "and he forgave all our sins."

935
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
 Hallelujah.

936
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,400
 He canceled the record of the charges against us

937
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,640
 and took it away by nailing it to the cross.

938
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,600
 In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers

939
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,480
 and authorities.

940
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,560
 Satan has no more claim on your life.

941
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
 You don't have to hold onto your past anymore.

942
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,400
 You can be free.

943
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,760
 And he shamed them.

944
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,500
 He shamed them publicly by his victory

945
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,080
 over them on the cross.

946
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,440
 The point of Jesus is that you are no longer defined

947
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,400
 by what you've done,

948
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,960
 but rather all that Jesus has done for you.

949
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,440
 That's why this message,

950
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,720
 that's why this series is amazing.

951
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,200
 As we don't sit here and just look and go,

952
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,520
 "Look at all these sinners.

953
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,880
 "Look at all these sinners."

954
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,320
 We use this series to say, "Look at our Savior.

955
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,220
 "Look at what he can do with those who will trust him,

956
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,520
 "those who will surrender."

957
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,720
 He's not looking for perfection.

958
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
 He's looking for surrender.

959
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,160
 He's looking for your heart.

960
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,420
 And if you would give it to him,

961
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,380
 watch what he will do.

962
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,540
 He will make you new.

963
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,160
 No one here tonight is too far.

964
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,880
 No one here tonight has messed up too bad.

965
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,680
 That thing that you think you are taking to the grave,

966
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
 let me remind you, he went to the grave.

967
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,020
 He went to the grave and he didn't stay there.

968
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,080
 So that way you don't have to stay in your sin.

969
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,360
 You don't have to stay in your secrecy.

970
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,760
 You can bring it to the light

971
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,060
 because Jesus rose, because he defeated death.

972
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,060
 You can walk alive.

973
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,260
 You can walk new.

974
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,060
 To say that your past is too messed up for God to use

975
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,080
 is to basically say the gospel is not powerful enough.

976
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,740
 To say that your past is too messed up for God to use

977
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,220
 is to basically say that the gospel is not powerful enough.

978
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,620
 But we know as Christians that that's not true.

979
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,060
 We know that in Jesus, all things are made new.

980
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,200
 Your sin is something that describes you,

981
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,780
 but it is not what defines you.

982
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,460
 Jesus defines you.

983
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,020
 Your sin may be a part of your story.

984
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,700
 It is no longer the point of your story.

985
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,500
 Jesus is.

986
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,740
 I asked a few of you on Instagram

987
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,860
 to just reply to my story.

988
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,760
 I said, I once was blank, but because of Jesus, I'm blank.

989
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,900
 Here's what people replied, just a few.

990
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,220
 I once was wanting guys to fill the void of love

991
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,260
 and attention that my dad left empty.

992
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,980
 And because of Jesus, I have unlimited love,

993
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,140
 attention, and wholeness from God.

994
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,820
 I once was a slave to suicidal thoughts,

995
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,160
 but because of Jesus, I am now free.

996
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,660
 I once was a slave to masturbation and pornography,

997
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,380
 but because of Jesus, I'm redeemed and made new.

998
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,240
 I once was a slave to alcoholism,

999
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,340
 but because of Jesus, I'm saved and free.

1000
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,940
 This story tonight, your story tonight,

1001
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,440
 should be a reminder that God can use any story

1002
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,080
 to point to the goodness of Jesus.

1003
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,340
 Every single one of you.

1004
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,460
 So many of us spend our life focusing on our sin

1005
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,560
 instead of our Savior.

1006
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,000
 You think constantly, I can't, my sin, I can't,

1007
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,880
 this addiction, I can't, this thing, this thing, this thing.

1008
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,220
 You know, we tend to follow what we focus on.

1009
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,800
 What you obsessively think about,

1010
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
 that's what you tend to go after.

1011
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,680
 And because you're constantly thinking about me, me, me, me,

1012
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,720
 my sin, that's why you're a slave to it.

1013
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,600
 It's time to stop focusing on your sin

1014
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,480
 and focus on the finished work of your Savior.

1015
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,540
 And if you would look at him rather than at your sin,

1016
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,360
 watch what will happen in your life.

1017
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,880
 If you will remind yourself that he's defeated your sin,

1018
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,400
 watch what will happen in your life.

1019
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,040
 If you will preach the gospel to yourself,

1020
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,760
 this truth to yourself every single day

1021
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,680
 and look at your Savior, look at your Savior.

1022
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,160
 When the enemy brings your sin,

1023
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,520
 when he brings your circumstances, your past, your mind,

1024
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,040
 if you would look at your Savior, watch what would happen.

1025
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,640
 Watch how God would use you.

1026
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,320
 I once had to, I'll start to wrap up.

1027
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,080
 My doctor thought I had a hypertension

1028
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,900
 'cause I kept having elevated blood pressure.

1029
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,820
 So he sent me home with this 24-hour blood pressure machine

1030
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,640
 and it's so obnoxious.

1031
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,620
 It's like this big pack and then you hook on the thing

1032
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,880
 and every 20 minutes for 24 hours,

1033
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,480
 even while you're sleeping, it's like beep, beep.

1034
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,400
 (imitates beeping)

1035
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,880
 And you're like.

1036
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,960
 And the problem is when you focus on the blood pressure

1037
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,560
 dropping the numbers, you know what actually happens?

1038
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,320
 You get more stressed, you start focusing harder,

1039
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,960
 your blood pressure starts to elevate.

1040
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,100
 And I'm gonna be like, oh my gosh,

1041
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,520
 I won't be able to drink coffee.

1042
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,000
 He's gonna take everything away from me.

1043
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,040
 He's gonna freak out.

1044
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,880
 I've gotta calm this down, I gotta calm this down.

1045
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,640
 So I'm doing meditation, I light incense,

1046
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,520
 I don't even do incense.

1047
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,080
 I'm just doing all these different things

1048
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,660
 to calm myself down.

1049
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,200
 But the reality was is the more that I kept focusing

1050
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,380
 on getting my numbers down, the more they kept rising.

1051
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,740
 I think it's the same with our sin.

1052
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,600
 The more we keep trying to focus on no, no, bad, bad, bad,

1053
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,800
 it keeps rising up in us because we're so focused on it.

1054
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,400
 You know what happened?

1055
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,600
 I finally gave up.

1056
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,680
 And I said, God, if I have hypertension,

1057
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,380
 it's good that I know I'm giving it to you.

1058
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,520
 I'm gonna go about my day.

1059
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,360
 I'm gonna go to the store.

1060
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,180
 I'm gonna hang out with my friends.

1061
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,600
 I'm gonna eat normal and it's up to you.

1062
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,880
 Give the results to you.

1063
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,780
 You know what doctor said to me?

1064
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,080
 He said, look good.

1065
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,600
 Started off a little high, but then it got normal.

1066
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,360
 I was like, huh, okay.

1067
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,000
 (congregation laughing)

1068
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,560
 There's something about that in Jesus

1069
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,000
 that if Christians would stop focusing on themselves

1070
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 and their circumstances and their sin

1071
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,320
 and letting them define their life

1072
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,040
 and start letting their savior define their life,

1073
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,520
 I think that things would change.

1074
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,960
 I think they would start walking in their calling.

1075
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,920
 I think they would start believing

1076
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,960
 that God could use anything to change the world,

1077
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,640
 that God can love anyone, even sinners like them.

1078
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,800
 It's time that we shift our focus off ourselves.

1079
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,680
 It's time for Christians to start living

1080
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,200
 like the grave is more powerful than our sin,

1081
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,860
 that the empty tomb is more powerful than our sin.

1082
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,080
 Because if you continue to let sin define you,

1083
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
 you know what you're living like?

1084
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,680
 You're living like the gospel story is incomplete.

1085
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,300
 You're living like Jesus died, but then he stayed dead,

1086
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,640
 but that's not the story.

1087
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,400
 He rose again.

1088
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,340
 The tomb is empty.

1089
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,640
 You are free, so live like it.

1090
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,520
 Live like you are a free people,

1091
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,720
 no longer held back, no longer disqualified,

1092
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,320
 but qualified because of what Jesus has done.

1093
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,080
 Romans 8 puts it like this.

1094
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,080
 The spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead

1095
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,240
 lives in you.

1096
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,480
 And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead,

1097
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,280
 he will give life to your mortal bodies

1098
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,960
 by the same spirit living within you.

1099
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,300
 Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,

1100
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,080
 you have no obligation to do

1101
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,440
 what your sinful nature urges you to do.

1102
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,860
 For if you live by its dictates, you will die.

1103
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,460
 But if through the power of the spirit,

1104
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,740
 you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature,

1105
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,380
 you will live.

1106
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,260
 For all who are led by the spirit of God

1107
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,820
 are children of God.

1108
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,120
 Because of Jesus, our sin is dead.

1109
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,180
 We need to start living like it's dead.

1110
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,020
 Start living like Jesus is alive.

1111
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,100
 And so can we be.

1112
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,800
 Psalm 103, 12 says that he, meaning God,

1113
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,940
 has removed our sins as far from us

1114
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,880
 as the East is from the West.

1115
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,340
 Isaiah 43, 25 says, I, meaning God,

1116
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,360
 yes, I alone will blot out your sins for my own sake

1117
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,680
 and will never think of them again.

1118
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,900
 I thought that was so crazy that God says,

1119
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,460
 hey, I took care of your sins.

1120
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,700
 My son died for you.

1121
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,660
 So that way I don't have to ever think about

1122
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,820
 those things again.

1123
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,980
 They don't define you.

1124
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,340
 And if God can so easily forget your sins,

1125
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,220
 why can't you?

1126
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,620
 God, the one that you sinned against,

1127
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,640
 the one that you wronged,

1128
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,000
 if he can move on, if he can forget,

1129
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,720
 why do you keep remembering?

1130
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,840
 Why do you keep dwelling on the mistakes you've made?

1131
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,080
 Why do you keep letting your past hold you back

1132
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,160
 from a future of being loved and used by God?

1133
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,120
 He's forgotten.

1134
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,360
 He put your sin in the grave where it belongs.

1135
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,240
 You can too.

1136
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,640
 You can live like you were new.

1137
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,560
 You can live like you were loved.

1138
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,360

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1229
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1230
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1231
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1232
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1233
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1234
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1235
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1236
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1237
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
 You can live like you were loved.

1238
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
 For my death for you, I defeated sin for you,

1239
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
 for this moment.

1240
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
 You don't have to hide.

1241
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
 You can walk in the light.

1242
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
 I think there's so many people in here tonight

1243
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
 that whether you realize it or not,

1244
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
 you've been living like you're disqualified.

1245
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
 You've been living like you're disqualified.

1246
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
 You've been walking with a limp,

1247
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
 addicted,

1248
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
 saying, "I'll never be free.

1249
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
 "I'll never be that guy.

1250
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
 "I'll never be that girl."

1251
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
 Jesus is saying, "Hey, no, I make all things new.

1252
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
 "I take Judah and Tamars.

1253
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
 "I take people just like you,

1254
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
 "people like you, JD,

1255
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
 "and I make them new.

1256
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
 "I qualify them."

1257
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
 "I qualify them."

1258
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
 And I'm telling you guys,

1259
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
 if you would believe that,

1260
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
 if you would believe that the blood of Jesus

1261
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
 is stronger than your circumstances,

1262
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
 than your sin,

1263
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
 than your sin,

1264
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
 I want you to watch

1265
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
 how God will take you

1266
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
 and people like us

1267
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
 and Judah's and Tamar's,

1268
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
 and He will take

1269
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
 sinful people to execute

1270
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
 a perfect plan.

1271
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
 Let's pray.

1272
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,800
 God, we trust in Your sovereignty.

1273
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
 We trust in Your goodness.

1274
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
 We trust that in You

1275
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
 and through You, all things

1276
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
 hold together.

1277
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
 And I can imagine there are

1278
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
 some people tonight that

1279
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,800
 if we were to read their story tonight,

1280
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,800
 if we were to put their circumstances

1281
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
 or their sin

1282
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
 on display for the world to see,

1283
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
 like we just did with Judah and Tamar,

1284
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
 people would think, "There's no way.

1285
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
 "There's no way

1286
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
 "God can use this.

1287
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
 "This amount of brokenness,

1288
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
 "this amount of hurt, this amount of pain,

1289
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,800
 "these circumstances, there's no way that God

1290
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
 "wants to use this to point to Jesus."

1291
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,800
 But that's

1292
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 just not true.

1293
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
 May we take a step of faith tonight

1294
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
 in believing that You want to use every single

1295
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,800
 story in this room tonight.

1296
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
 You want to take the person

1297
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
 who has been a slave to sin

1298
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
 and set them free.

1299
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
 You want to take the person

1300
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
 who has held themselves

1301
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
 back, wishing they had different

1302
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800
 circumstances, and You want to change

1303
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
 and transform their mind to see what You are

1304
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,800
 doing in the midst of the hard,

1305
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
 in the midst of the challenge, what You're

1306
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
 producing in them so You can work through them.

1307
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
 I pray that tonight

1308
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
 we would not be marked

1309
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
 by people who think we have to clean up our act

1310
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
 to come to You or be a perfect people.

1311
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
 We would be a broken people realizing

1312
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
 our need for a perfect Savior.

1313
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
 Would You come,

1314
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
 take this mess and

1315
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
 make it a message, take these stories,

1316
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
 share them with the world

1317
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
 that all may know

1318
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
 that left to ourself, we are

1319
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
 hopeless, left to our sin,

1320
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
 we are thirsty

1321
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
 and tired and need to come back

1322
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
 again and again and again,

1323
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
 but with You, Jesus,

1324
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
 with You, God,

1325
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
 You make all things new.

1326
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
 You can rewrite the story

1327
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
 and we can be free.

1328
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
 We can be loved and used by You.

1329
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,480
 May we worship like it's so.

1330
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,980
 In that we pray, amen.
