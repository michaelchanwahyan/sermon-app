1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,680
 - Well guys, good evening.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,040
 My name's Harrison Ross.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,520
 I am on staff here at Watermark.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
 And recently I have started eating differently.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,580
 Anybody else kind of on this trend of changing what you eat?

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,220
 (audience laughing)

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,180
 Yeah, so recently I have cut out gluten and dairy

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,660
 from my entire diet.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,020
 Okay, so some people are celebrating me.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,940
 Other people are judging me and going,

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,740
 "You hippie, what is your problem?

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,560
 "Eat a burger."

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,420
 Okay, before, hey, I'm all in on the burger

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,340
 now without a bun and cheese.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,260
 It's terrible.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,900
 But hear me out, okay?

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,140
 Few years ago, I did Whole30.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,820
 I did it kicking and screaming.

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,340
 Anybody else on the Whole30 trend?

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,700
 Anybody out there?

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,000
 Anybody on Whole30 right now?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,040
 No, we've all just said, "Screw Whole30, it's terrible."

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,340
 So I tried Whole30.

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,860
 I hated it.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,860
 And then I kind of loved it.

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,380
 It really started to change the way I was thinking.

28
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,840
 My wife was already not eating gluten and dairy

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,420
 because of some health stuff.

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,460
 And so it was something that I kind of enjoyed

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,220
 and I quickly bailed from.

32
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,920
 I got to 30, I ran away from it,

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,660
 and was like, "This is not for me."

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,780
 But recently, now I'm back because of some other things,

35
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,380
 of how it's affecting clarity of thought,

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,380
 other things like that,

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,380
 and partially because I have been haunted my entire life

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,840
 from this picture in high school.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,740
 So this is me.

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,640
 I know.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,780
 There's not even judgment.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,920
 There's just shame and sorrow.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,060
 This is me on Easter.

44
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,540
 I'm a ninth grader in high school.

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,580
 I have frosted tips that I did unintentionally.

46
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,600
 I'm wearing a rope choker necklace

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,140
 that I think I have a scar indented from

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,180
 because I was so chubby in the neck.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,900
 And I definitely suffered from what's called moobs,

50
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,360
 man boobs.

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
 They are real.

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,620
 Yes, you shout because you understand.

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,180
 This is my life in junior high and high school.

54
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,860
 I was the kid that was deathly afraid

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,620
 to go to the end of the year school party

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,500
 at the masses house 'cause it was a pool party.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,820
 I was that guy.

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,480
 I was deathly afraid because of how I looked,

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,460
 because I was overweight, because I felt chubby,

60
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,340
 because I had puffy nipples, and I just didn't,

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,780
 I did not, I'm serious, I did not want to go

62
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,660
 and submit myself to this.

63
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,500
 And so here I am years later now trying to change

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,900
 what I eat, but I think our society as a whole

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,060
 is obsessed, interested, but really obsessed

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,180
 with losing weight, whether that's changing how we eat

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,980
 through Whole30 or keto, which doesn't work.

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,740
 I'll fight you on it.

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,060
 It works for a little bit, but so anyways.

70
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,180
 Paleo or getting on the CrossFit trend

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,240
 or going back to your Insanity DVDs

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,360
 that you had to dig out of your closet.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
 He's gonna shred you.

74
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,140
 We are obsessed with trying to lose weight.

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,380
 Couple of pounds here and there, a complete life overhaul.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,740
 Because we all know what it's like to have one or two

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,800
 or 50 too many chips when you go to Chewy's.

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,320
 And then to down the rest of the queso bowl

79
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,020
 before the rest of your table can.

80
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,540
 I mean, no one else is going to, so I had to.

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,900
 We all have this little extra that we kind of grab

82
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,560
 here and there and we don't think about

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,220
 and late night Sour Patch Watermelon, man, those get me.

84
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,100
 We kind of grab all these things and hold on

85
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,260
 and there's the phrase, I have it on a coffee mug

86
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,660
 that says, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips.

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,220
 And I have love handles to prove it.

88
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,800
 And so we all can relate to that.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,140
 We all have weight that we want to get rid of

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,180
 and all of us walked in here tonight

91
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,140
 with something we're holding on to

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,820
 and a weight that we want to get rid of.

93
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,100
 You're looking at me going, bro, speak for yourself.

94
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,620
 I look amazing.

95
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,780
 I looked at myself today.

96
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,260
 I posted it on Instagram.

97
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,220
 I'm incredible.

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,380
 I'm in summer shape.

99
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,340
 But I want you to hear me again.

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,540
 Each of us walked in here tonight

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,460
 holding on to something, carrying weight

102
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,860
 that we want to get rid of.

103
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,420
 And tonight we're gonna talk about how to lose the weight.

104
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,100
 We're not gonna talk about how to lose physical weight.

105
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,200
 We're gonna talk about how to lose soul weight.

106
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,740
 Because most of you, if not all of you,

107
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,320
 walked in here carrying something really heavy,

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,260
 a burden, something that's overwhelming you,

109
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,180
 something that's wearing you out, making you tired,

110
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,220
 maybe even hurting you, depleting you.

111
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,380
 What's soul weight?

112
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,660
 Soul weight are things from your past, struggles,

113
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,740
 maybe things that are happening currently.

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,660
 For most of us, that's sin.

115
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,780
 For most of us, it's the choices that we make,

116
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,620
 the things that we grab at,

117
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,340
 whether we're thinking about it intentionally

118
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
 or we just kind of aren't thinking about it,

119
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,420
 and it adds to our soul weight.

120
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,300
 But the soul weight that we carry

121
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,380
 is not just sin and struggles,

122
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,900
 but it's emotional weight,

123
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,100
 emotions that well up inside us because of us

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,420
 or because of others, could be disappointments

125
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,700
 or could be hurts that others have done to us,

126
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,500
 and we hold on to it, we carry it.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,380
 And it then begins to affect all of us,

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,620
 all of our body, not just sticking to our love handles,

129
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,460
 but sticking to our heart and our soul

130
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,460
 and affecting the rest of the way that we live our life.

131
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,660
 And it's heavy.

132
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,620
 Why do I need to get rid of soul weight?

133
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,140
 Why do I need to lose the weight?

134
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,140
 Because the weight that you carry causes guilt and shame,

135
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,020
 and it affects the way that you look at everything.

136
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,740
 The soul weight that you carry affects the way

137
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,380
 that you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning.

138
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,180
 It affects the way that you look at others around you,

139
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,860
 and it even affects the way that you look at God.

140
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,780
 What if, just imagine for a second,

141
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,060
 if you didn't have to carry around the guilt and shame

142
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,420
 of your sexual sin,

143
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,340
 replaying over and over and over that one night stand

144
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,900
 or the end of that relationship,

145
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,460
 laying in bed late at night,

146
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,540
 replaying that tape or that mistake.

147
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,660
 What would it be like to not have to deal

148
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,180
 with anxiety anymore?

149
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,140
 Could you imagine?

150
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,460
 To not have to deal with that crippling pain in your chest

151
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,620
 or that nagging, ah!

152
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,860
 If it could go away, would you wanna get rid of that weight?

153
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,860
 Or what would your relationships be like

154
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,380
 if you could fully trust people again

155
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,540
 and not assume that everyone was always gonna hurt you?

156
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,540
 What burden did you walk in here carrying?

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,060
 What weight are you holding onto that you need to lose?

158
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,340
 Not just so that you can feel better about yourself,

159
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,460
 and I want you to hear this clearly,

160
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,580
 and you're gonna hear it throughout.

161
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,420
 Not so that God can love you more,

162
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,580
 'cause that's not the point,

163
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,060
 but so you can be free.

164
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,180
 So you can live the life that God intended you

165
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,060
 so that you could be healthy,

166
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,020
 so that you could be fully who God created you to be.

167
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,940
 God wants to free you of your burdens.

168
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,060
 Jesus said, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden,

169
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,100
 "and take my yoke upon me,

170
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,500
 "for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

171
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,580
 Do you want that?

172
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,860
 'Cause most of us walk around

173
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,860
 and we don't feel easy and light.

174
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,300
 We feel burdened from the soul weight that we carry.

175
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,420
 So how do we get rid of the weight?

176
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,020
 Hebrews 12, one says, "Therefore, since we are surrounded

177
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,580
 "by so great a cloud of witnesses,

178
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
 "let us also lay aside every weight,

179
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,820
 "every sin which clings so closely right here."

180
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,020
 (laughs)

181
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,460
 Right here.

182
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,540
 (laughs)

183
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,100
 Let us lay aside every weight,

184
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,180
 every sin that clings so closely,

185
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,100
 and let us run with endurance the race set before us.

186
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,860
 Let us be free.

187
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,660
 That's a command.

188
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
 Get rid of it.

189
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,340
 Run in freedom.

190
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,700
 So how do we get rid of the weight?

191
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,860
 Tonight, we're gonna look at how to get rid of the soul weight,

192
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,140
 the ABCs of shedding the weight.

193
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,300
 And the first one is you've gotta admit you have a problem.

194
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,180
 You just gotta first be honest with yourself.

195
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,260
 'Cause here's the problem you have.

196
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,220
 It's sin.

197
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,340
 It is coursing through your veins,

198
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 and it will wreck your life.

199
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,620
 It will destroy you.

200
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,500
 And it may not be sin that you're carrying,

201
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,780
 but because of your sin, we wanna hide these things

202
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,420
 from others, but even from ourselves,

203
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,900
 we wanna just pretend it's not there,

204
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,620
 or mask it, or control it, or manage it in some way,

205
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,980
 and just think that maybe if we move on, it will go away.

206
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,420
 Because every person in this room struggles with sin.

207
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,420
 Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned

208
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,500
 "and fall short of the glory of God."

209
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,420
 Everybody's on the same playing field.

210
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,980
 First John 1, verse eight, it says,

211
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,140
 "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,

212
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,820
 "and the truth is not in us."

213
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,660
 We all have problems.

214
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,860
 For me, the stuff that I'm walking in here,

215
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,620
 just from today, is I wanna stare

216
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,220
 at every woman that walks by.

217
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,460
 I sat at a coffee shop today,

218
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
 just trying to spend time with the Lord,

219
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,980
 and a girl would walk by, and I would see myself

220
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,900
 wanting to go that way.

221
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,020
 When I say stare, I don't mean just like,

222
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,300
 oh, oh wow, okay, there's a woman.

223
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,460
 I mean I wanna gawk at, feast on,

224
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,980
 I want to linger long on a woman who's not my wife.

225
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,900
 I wanna run to porn, most days,

226
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,740
 especially on days where I'm feeling overwhelmed,

227
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,500
 or tired, or stressed, or insignificant and insecure.

228
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,900
 I wanna run back to this safety blanket

229
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,620
 that I ran to for so long.

230
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,580
 Those are like today, and recently in my life.

231
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,020
 Those are the burdens that I carry every single day.

232
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:55,180
 So we have to admit to ourselves that we have a problem.

233
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,940
 It's as simple as this.

234
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,220
 I like porn.

235
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,700
 Stop trying to make excuses.

236
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,660
 Stop trying to call it something else.

237
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,780
 Be honest and admit it to yourself.

238
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,860
 I like porn.

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,620
 I drink a lot, and I hate myself.

240
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,660
 And then I hate myself more,

241
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,180
 so it drives me to drinking continually.

242
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,460
 I hate the way that my body looks.

243
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,460
 I don't like who I am.

244
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,380
 I need to lose that extra 10 pounds

245
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,380
 that my mom always reminded me to lose all growing up.

246
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,380
 Whatever it is for you, admit that you have a problem.

247
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,740
 And some of you who are in here right now,

248
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,060
 some of you are listening to me,

249
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,860
 and you're responding the strongest.

250
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,580
 Not in writing notes, but kind of welling up an emotion

251
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,340
 and just like, oh, come on, man, no.

252
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,060
 No, I don't have a problem.

253
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,700
 You're getting kind of like maybe pissed off at me

254
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,540
 of calling you out.

255
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,540
 You're like, no, dude, get off me.

256
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,660
 Well, you're who I'm most concerned about.

257
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,980
 'Cause if this was a lose weight message,

258
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,380
 it's the guys like me who have a high metabolism

259
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,720
 and think that they can eat whatever they want

260
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,260
 that are the ones that get diabetes

261
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,160
 and heart failure later down the road.

262
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,500
 If you think that you don't have something

263
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,980
 that you're struggling with or you're carrying,

264
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,780
 then you're gonna exhaust yourself.

265
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,660
 I want you to live in freedom.

266
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,100
 You don't have to carry that anymore.

267
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,900
 God wants to take that from you.

268
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,300
 Because when we carry these things,

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,180
 most of the weight that we carry,

270
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,940
 a lot of you know, if you have real weight like I did,

271
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,380
 you wanna conceal it.

272
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,140
 You wanna wear the stripes and the plaids.

273
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,700
 We don't wanna show people.

274
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,920
 I didn't wanna go to pool parties.

275
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,700
 And so what we do with our struggles

276
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
 is we just carry it around.

277
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 It's like we're carrying a giant thing of weight

278
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,020
 all the time.

279
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,220
 And if you can't tell from how hard it is to put it on,

280
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,100
 it's heavy.

281
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,420
 We measured it.

282
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,780
 There are 62.5 pounds on this vest.

283
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:22,020
 And on here are the burdens that we carry.

284
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,420
 Some of them are things that I personally carry.

285
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,700
 Some of them represent the things

286
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
 that you may struggle with.

287
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
 And again, I want you to hear, this isn't just sin.

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,180
 But the weight that we carry, the weight we need to lose,

289
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,180
 the burdens we have could be sin, could be emotions,

290
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,300
 could be disappointments, or it may be hurt

291
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,540
 from recent or in the past,

292
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,540
 that you're just holding onto and carrying for far too long.

293
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,660
 But you don't have to carry it.

294
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,940
 You can see these right now.

295
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,060
 But if I walked out of here the rest of the night,

296
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,300
 the rest of the week, you'd be like,

297
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,140
 dude, get that freaking vest off of you.

298
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,460
 That looks exhausting.

299
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,360
 That's the point of tonight's message.

300
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,140
 You gotta admit that you have a problem.

301
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,700
 And then second is bring it into the light.

302
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,560
 Staying in 1 John, 1 John 1, verse nine,

303
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,980
 it says, "If we confess our sins,

304
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,800
 "he is faithful and just to forgive our sins

305
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,220
 "and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

306
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,380
 You don't have to hide it.

307
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,660
 You don't have to conceal it.

308
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,060
 You don't have to manage it.

309
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,280
 You can confess it and be free.

310
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,620
 And God's not gonna look at you and go,

311
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
 ah, why'd you do that?

312
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,880
 He's not gonna spank you.

313
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,820
 He's not looking to rip you off or to punish you.

314
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
 He wants to set you free.

315
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,280
 We have to bring it into the light.

316
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,980
 We've gotta come to him and say,

317
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,580
 Lord, will you help me with this?

318
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,220
 But guys, that's not enough to just go,

319
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,020
 God, take this from me.

320
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,180
 We've gotta take it a step further

321
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,900
 and bring others into our lives.

322
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,300
 James 5, 16 says, "Therefore, if you confess your sins

323
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,060
 "to one another and pray for one another,

324
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,780
 "that you may be healed."

325
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,200
 God loves you and he wants to set you free,

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
 but a part of his provision and healing for you

327
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,040
 is all around you,

328
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,060
 is his people who will love you and walk with you

329
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,540
 and bear your burdens together.

330
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,960
 So guys, to bring it into the light,

331
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,620
 you just have to confess it

332
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,060
 and watch that weight disappear.

333
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,540
 One of the things that I struggled with for a long time,

334
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,020
 and you heard I still am tempted towards it, is porn.

335
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,860
 I was addicted to porn for 12 years.

336
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,020
 In high school, there were nights that I could not

337
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,460
 go to sleep without looking at porn and masturbating,

338
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,440
 sometimes several times.

339
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,400
 And it wrecked my life all the way into college.

340
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,500
 And I have to confess it.

341
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,740
 And when I do, when I bring that into the light,

342
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,620
 and for a long time I hid it.

343
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,540
 For a long time, I didn't want anybody to know.

344
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,980
 I thought, I'm this Christian kid

345
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,140
 that's struggling with this.

346
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,100
 Why do I have to do this?

347
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,380
 And I bought that lie of, well, God knows.

348
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
 I can come to him and he'll set me free.

349
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,940
 And yes, I've got eternity with him

350
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,420
 because of my belief in Jesus.

351
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,300
 But healing comes when I confess to others.

352
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,980
 And so in college, I finally let these guys in

353
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,620
 and I got over the fear of what they would think of me.

354
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,540
 I got over the fear of how then I would look or feel

355
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,300
 if now that they know this about me and I confessed it,

356
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,060
 I brought it into a light and that weight disappears.

357
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,340
 Another one I struggle with is pride.

358
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,460
 I'm full of myself.

359
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,140
 I love people and I'm nice to people,

360
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,940
 but deep down, I am consumed with me.

361
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,660
 And when I confess that, that weight goes away.

362
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,780
 The struggle doesn't go away,

363
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,620
 but I don't have to hide that and hold onto it anymore.

364
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,700
 I can be free.

365
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,340
 The other thing that I want is I want to be famous.

366
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,260
 I wanna be known.

367
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,580
 I wanna be celebrated and applauded.

368
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,700
 I want people to like me.

369
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,300
 And I've gotta confess that to a room of people

370
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,580
 who I want to like me.

371
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,420
 And when I do, that burden disappears and it goes away.

372
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,800
 And then I'm crippled with fear, fear of failure,

373
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,260
 fear of the future, fear of what if I'm not good enough?

374
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,420
 What if I can't produce?

375
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,140
 What if I can't perform?

376
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,260
 And I can confess that and that weight drops to the ground.

377
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,020
 And then because of those things,

378
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,620
 I'm riddled with insecurity,

379
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,900
 constantly thinking I'm not good enough.

380
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,060
 I can't match up.

381
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,660
 My gifts aren't good enough.

382
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,820
 I feel small in a room full of people.

383
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,060
 But I can confess and be free.

384
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,620
 Those are some of mine.

385
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,460
 What are some of yours?

386
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,220
 Maybe, maybe you really struggle with anger.

387
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,900
 Maybe you have these like fits of rage in your house

388
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,740
 and you try to hide it and you try to make sure

389
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,300
 that your roommates don't see,

390
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,540
 but you're just punching the pillow

391
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,780
 or screaming in your pillow.

392
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,460
 Don't hide it anymore.

393
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,300
 Let some people into your life and be free.

394
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,900
 Maybe you struggle with anxiety.

395
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,500
 Anxiety is not sin.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,980
 And before you think, oh, he's just gonna cut it

397
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
 and it disappears, I want you to hear,

398
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,220
 anxiety and all of these things don't just disappear,

399
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,620
 but you can bring others in so that the burden

400
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,060
 that you carry alone is no longer on your shoulders

401
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,340
 and you can walk in freedom as you walk towards healing

402
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,180
 with Jesus.

403
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,780
 If you struggle with anxiety in any sort of way,

404
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,740
 and when I mean struggle,

405
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,460
 that that's just constantly in your head,

406
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,260
 man, find somebody and tell them.

407
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,980
 And let that weight be lifted.

408
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,180
 Maybe you're just really into the party scene.

409
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,420
 Whatever drug you can find,

410
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 whatever party you can go to on the weekend

411
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,980
 to just smash yourself Friday and Saturday night

412
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,060
 to forget whatever happened throughout the week,

413
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,420
 and you live in this constant cycle.

414
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,980
 You live this double life.

415
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,100
 Let people in and be free.

416
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,460
 Maybe you're a liar.

417
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,260
 Maybe you just are constantly telling mistruths

418
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,060
 or close truths, and you're just a chronic liar

419
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,300
 continually building a story and a fantasy,

420
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,940
 and it's this game that you play.

421
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,380
 Live in the light.

422
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,780
 Bring it to the light and lose the weight

423
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,140
 and walk in freedom.

424
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,780
 Maybe you have an eating disorder.

425
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,860
 You try to control your life and control your emotions

426
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,620
 and control the way you look by what you do.

427
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,620
 You control the way you look by what you eat or don't eat

428
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,940
 or gagging yourself,

429
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,140
 and it is literally wasting away your body.

430
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,340
 You don't have to anymore.

431
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,060
 You don't have to hide.

432
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,740
 Be free.

433
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,660
 Walk in the light.

434
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,460
 Maybe you struggle with homosexuality

435
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,140
 and same-sex attraction.

436
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,620
 Maybe nobody knows.

437
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,260
 Maybe you're just deathly afraid to tell somebody.

438
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,660
 I would love for you to see people love you,

439
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,260
 whether it's this or any of the things

440
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,860
 that are on this vest.

441
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
 You can be honest with where you are,

442
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,740
 with where you're tempted, with where you struggle,

443
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,020
 with where you've been,

444
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,140
 and watch that burden disappear.

445
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,420
 Maybe it's sexual sin.

446
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,340
 Maybe it was that one-night stand

447
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,100
 that you were in the bathroom with your boyfriend

448
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,060
 and you're like, "I'm not gonna do it again."

449
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,420
 Maybe it's the fact that you're here.

450
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,500
 Maybe it's you're living with your boyfriend

451
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,420
 or your girlfriend.

452
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,100
 Maybe you're confused about your sexuality

453
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,660
 and you're contemplating making a change.

454
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,460
 Whatever that is, bring it in to the light

455
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,380
 and walk in freedom.

456
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,020
 Maybe you've had an abortion,

457
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,220
 and the weight of that haunts you every day.

458
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,100
 Let people in to love you

459
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:36,660
 so that we can just help carry that pain with you.

460
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,460
 Maybe you're materialistic.

461
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,260
 You're consumed with what you buy, what you wear.

462
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
 I struggle with that.

463
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,980
 I stand in the closet for way too long

464
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,700
 picking out what it's like.

465
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
 Ridiculous.

466
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,820
 But maybe you're just obsessed with buying stuff

467
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,980
 and continuing this addiction to stuff.

468
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,220
 Maybe you're depressed.

469
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,460
 Maybe it's beyond just anxiety that creeps in here or there.

470
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,060
 Maybe you are consumed.

471
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,660
 You are not just heavy.

472
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,060
 You are depleted.

473
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,300
 You are exhausted.

474
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,500
 And again, this is not something that disappears,

475
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,700
 but bring people into your life

476
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,980
 so that we can help you shed the soul weight

477
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,820
 and bring it in to the light.

478
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,780
 Maybe you're suicidal.

479
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,820
 Maybe the burden that you came in here with

480
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,180
 tonight is going,

481
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,300
 is tonight the night?

482
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,500
 Maybe it was last night.

483
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
 Maybe it was one time in the past.

484
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,580
 Maybe it's a recurring thought.

485
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,020
 Jesus died so that you don't have to.

486
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,140
 Bring that into the light.

487
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,020
 Confess it.

488
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,700
 Let us walk with you and walk in freedom.

489
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,540
 Then there are other things.

490
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,420
 Maybe you've got an addiction, drugs,

491
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,660
 alcohol, yourself, whatever it is.

492
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,540
 Be honest and be free.

493
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,500
 But there are other things that we carry

494
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,660
 that can't just be cut off.

495
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,580
 Things that have happened to us

496
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,380
 could be disappointments, could be hurts.

497
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,900
 Things like divorce.

498
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,020
 Maybe you were divorced.

499
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,260
 Maybe your parents were divorced early on

500
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,980
 and that really affected your life

501
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,260
 and the way that you live.

502
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,660
 The way that you have relationships with people.

503
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,220
 The way that you date or don't.

504
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,220
 Maybe somebody in your family got a diagnosis of cancer.

505
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,540
 Or some other terminal illness, or maybe you did.

506
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,260
 And it's heavy and it's hard.

507
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:41,100
 Maybe there was a death in your family recently.

508
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,140
 Death of a friend.

509
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,180
 Death, loss of some kind of someone close to you.

510
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,260
 Maybe you're a single parent.

511
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,100
 My wife and I, a few years ago, we had a miscarriage.

512
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,660
 That was hard for us.

513
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,060
 We didn't know how to carry that.

514
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,460
 It was a weight that I didn't know how to handle.

515
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,740
 The death of my own child.

516
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,580
 Those are things that you can't just be like,

517
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,340
 okay, they're gone.

518
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,980
 But we can still confess them and bring them into light.

519
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,700
 And then maybe there are things

520
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,100
 that you've tried to just put behind you.

521
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,900
 Maybe there are things that you've tried

522
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,620
 to just ignore from yourself.

523
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,460
 Hurt that was done to you,

524
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
 that you have just tried to push away.

525
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
 Not only from the world, but even from yourself.

526
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,980
 It's not on the front of your chest.

527
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,620
 It's way behind you and buried in your life.

528
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,300
 So maybe, maybe you were abandoned

529
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,820
 early on as a little boy or as a little girl

530
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,980
 by one of your parents.

531
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,140
 Or by a close friend.

532
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,260
 Or by a boyfriend or girlfriend or fiance.

533
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,420
 Maybe you were abused.

534
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:02,180
 Physically abused, emotionally abused,

535
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,420
 sexually abused by a family member,

536
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,180
 a friend, or someone close to you.

537
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,340
 Those are weights that are heavy.

538
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,620
 Those are weights that we tend to bury

539
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,900
 deep down inside of us.

540
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,340
 And guys, you don't have to carry that alone.

541
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,140
 (congregation laughing)

542
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,620
 Galatians 6.2 says that we are called

543
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,940
 to bear one another's burdens.

544
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,020
 When we bring these things into the light,

545
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,660
 then others come around us,

546
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,940
 just as you are coming around me now.

547
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,260
 And through community, we can take those things

548
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,500
 and we can throw off these weights that hinder us

549
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,340
 and cast them aside.

550
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,980
 And the weight that we carry that was so heavy

551
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,860
 and was so burdensome and was so hard,

552
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
 you can be free.

553
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,820
 You can be free tonight.

554
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:57,660
 You can shed that weight, the soul weight,

555
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,580
 that clings so closely as you confess

556
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,180
 and walk in the light.

557
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,660
 But here's what happens.

558
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,780
 I hope you do that tonight.

559
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,820
 But then we tend to walk away,

560
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,100
 and I do the same thing.

561
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,620
 We have these things that we've confessed,

562
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,860
 but we wanna then pick the weight up again.

563
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,500
 We wanna pick up that struggle that was,

564
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,940
 and we wanna grab onto it,

565
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,860
 because it just kinda felt comfortable.

566
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,620
 We know it's bad, but it just feels safe.

567
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,220
 It feels known, even if it hurts us.

568
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,500
 So guys, this isn't a message of just,

569
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,940
 it's not a get it off your chest message.

570
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,260
 It's not just tell somebody once and move on.

571
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,580
 This is something that we have to practice

572
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,540
 all the time, continually,

573
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:53,660
 so that we can run, as we're called and commanded to do,

574
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,220
 to get rid of the weight.

575
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,700
 So you've gotta admit that you have a problem.

576
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,780
 You've gotta bring it into the light,

577
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,940
 and as you bring it into the light,

578
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,300
 then third, you've gotta continue in community.

579
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,860
 Not just do it once.

580
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,460
 It's not just a one and done,

581
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,860
 but then gather people around you

582
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,100
 who will love you and walk with you

583
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,260
 and help you walk in health and freedom in Jesus.

584
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,900
 This is not a message of, hey, you've gotta sin less.

585
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,220
 You've gotta do less bad things.

586
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,100
 We just gotta cut out the crap from your life.

587
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,780
 We want you to walk and run with Jesus,

588
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,660
 and to do that, we've gotta continue in community.

589
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,660
 Hebrews 3:13 says, "But exhort one another every day."

590
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,380
 Another translation says, "Encourage one another every day,

591
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,540
 "as long as it is called to that,

592
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
 "that none of you may be hardened

593
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,900
 "by the deceitfulness of sin."

594
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,700
 Not only are these weights heavy that we carry with us,

595
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,740
 we are deceived because we're sinful people,

596
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,900
 and we quickly forget, and we quickly run

597
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,780
 to these things again and hold onto 'em and run with them,

598
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,780
 instead of running in freedom and health.

599
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:18,620
 And so we need God's people around us, like Galatians 6:2,

600
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,780
 to bear one another's burdens, to carry them with us,

601
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,420
 to walk with us, to help us shed that weight,

602
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,740
 because we're gonna want to run back to it.

603
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,100
 For me, recently, I had to come to my community,

604
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,020
 and I had to confess that I was hashtag chasing on Instagram

605
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,620
 to try and find something sexy.

606
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,820
 It wasn't just like a, no, no, whoa, that's nice,

607
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,420
 and then keep going.

608
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,980
 I was intentionally clicking to hope

609
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,380
 that I'd maybe find something lucky.

610
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,660
 You know what I wanted to do?

611
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,660
 Hide it, control it, manage it.

612
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,260
 It's not that bad, it's not porn, it's nothing.

613
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,940
 It was one time, I'll move on.

614
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,700
 But then that turns into, well,

615
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,740
 maybe another time down the road.

616
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,020
 Maybe another time, how about a little longer,

617
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,620
 and then I'm back on the road to addiction.

618
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,860
 'Cause a lot of people in here did Whole30.

619
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,340
 You guys have gone through these 30 days,

620
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,900
 and you cut everything out of your life,

621
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,660
 but for most people, when Whole30 ends,

622
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,380
 so does the dieting process.

623
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,580
 You then just jump back into life.

624
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,260
 That first night you celebrate, and you're at Brahms,

625
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,580
 and you're like, oh, I love this stuff!

626
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,100
 And you're just taking it all back in,

627
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,540
 and within a couple weeks, you're close to

628
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,620
 or right back into fitting in the fat genes that you had.

629
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,300
 Because we think, we kinda get in these fad diets.

630
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,820
 Confessing sin is not a fad diet.

631
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,820
 This isn't something that we're just calling you

632
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,060
 to do once or do a little bit.

633
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,900
 But we've gotta do this continually.

634
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,340
 I got to sit with my community,

635
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,260
 and I got to sit with my wife and just say,

636
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,660
 hey, I need to be honest, here's where I went.

637
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,460
 Because I don't wanna continue down that road.

638
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,140
 I don't wanna carry this burden anymore.

639
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,380
 I wanna choose to walk with Jesus,

640
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,140
 even when I stray from Him and wanna run from Him.

641
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,100
 I want to run with Jesus,

642
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,180
 to run the race that is set before me.

643
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,180
 And in our society, most of us lose the physical weight

644
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,420
 so that people will love and accept us,

645
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,820
 so that we'll look better, we'll look thinner,

646
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,500
 look cooler, whatever it is,

647
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,980
 or maybe so that we can just stand in the mirror

648
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,580
 and love and accept ourselves.

649
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,900
 But God doesn't call us to lose the spiritual weight

650
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,900
 or lose this soul weight so that He'll love us more.

651
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,940
 We can lose the weight because of God's love for us.

652
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,380
 We don't have to earn His approval,

653
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,900
 we don't have to look good for Him,

654
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
 we don't have to look more spiritual,

655
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,020
 we don't have to look like we have it all together.

656
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,380
 He wants us to be free.

657
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,300
 We read Hebrews 12 together at the beginning.

658
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,980
 I'm gonna reread verse one,

659
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,900
 and then I wanna give the key to that.

660
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,100
 And then I wanna give the key verse of verse two.

661
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,700
 If you've never heard this verse,

662
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,380
 or if you're looking for a verse to memorize,

663
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,860
 this is one to put in your head

664
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,300
 or to put in the dashboard of your car,

665
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,540
 to write on your mirror,

666
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,100
 or to make the home screen of your phone

667
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,500
 so that you don't forget.

668
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
 Here's what it says.

669
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
 "Therefore, since we are surrounded

670
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,580
 "by so great a cloud of witnesses,

671
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,000
 "let us also lay aside every weight and sin

672
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,860
 "which clings so closely right here."

673
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,420
 Lay it aside, get rid of it,

674
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,500
 and run with endurance the race

675
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,560
 that is set before us looking to Jesus.

676
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,000
 Not looking to your own perfection,

677
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,740
 not looking to what you can do,

678
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,820
 not looking to your own goodness,

679
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,380
 to your own spirituality,

680
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,540
 to your own, wow, look how great I am at confessing sin.

681
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,200
 This is nothing that you do,

682
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,580
 it is all what God's gonna do in and through you

683
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,460
 by the power of Jesus Christ.

684
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,980
 As you lay this aside, looking to Jesus,

685
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,180
 the founder and the perfecter of our faith

686
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,580
 who for the joy that was set before him,

687
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,100
 endured the cross, despising the shame,

688
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,500
 and he is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

689
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,740
 God came down to this earth

690
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,580
 to bear the burdens that we all carry,

691
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
 to live a life that we live,

692
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,300
 to walk as a man, Jesus came,

693
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,400
 and he lived it perfectly.

694
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,780
 And then what it says that he did

695
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,340
 is he went to the cross for us

696
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,340
 to carry all of this junk that we've carried for so long.

697
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,700
 And he took it upon himself

698
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,440
 knowing that we would choose this,

699
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,340
 knowing that we'd run to our addiction,

700
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,140
 knowing that we'd run to our pride,

701
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,500
 knowing that we'd run to our self-righteousness

702
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 or self-loathing, and he said,

703
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,020
 "I will carry it for you."

704
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,580
 The shame that we feel,

705
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,460
 the shame that we're holding onto,

706
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,260
 the weight that clings so closely,

707
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,920
 he said, "I despise that shame.

708
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,920
 "I will put it on myself so that you can be free."

709
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,480
 All you have to do is look to me.

710
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,260
 Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden,

711
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,080
 and I will give you rest.

712
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,160
 Rest for your souls.

713
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,500
 Rest for eternity as we live forever with him

714
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,060
 for those who believe in him,

715
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,560
 but today you can be free.

716
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,620
 If you're in here and you don't know Jesus,

717
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,300
 you need to know that God is crazy about you.

718
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,780
 All this junk that I carry and we carry,

719
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,940
 God doesn't look down on you and look at you with pity

720
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,500
 or sorrow or shame or disappointment.

721
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,920
 He looks at you and he loves you.

722
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,940
 So he calls us to throw these things aside,

723
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,000
 to not try to fix our own weight,

724
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,860
 to not try to get all this stuff

725
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,180
 and try to carry it on our own,

726
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,880
 but to throw it aside and to look to Jesus.

727
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,880
 Who endured the cross for us,

728
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,880
 who rose again from the grave to give us life

729
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,960
 so that you could have life.

730
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,280
 Get rid of the weight.

731
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,880
 Get rid of the soul weight that you're holding onto.

732
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,340
 There's no easier time than tonight.

733
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,440
 Don't make the excuse of, "Well, I'm not ready,"

734
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,800
 or maybe two weeks from now.

735
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,320
 Find somebody tonight.

736
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,240
 And if you're not in community, then come find one of us.

737
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,160
 We'd love to help you find people

738
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,440
 that can come around you and love you

739
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,620
 so that you can be free because Jesus loves you.

740
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,520
 And he died for you to set you free.

741
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,440
 Heavenly Father, thank you.

742
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,520
 Thank you that you love me in spite of my crap.

743
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,680
 That 2,000 years ago, while I was still a sinner,

744
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,080
 before I had committed any sin,

745
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,000
 before I thought of any sin, before I was even born,

746
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,480
 you loved me, you chose me, you died for me.

747
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,920
 Thank you, Lord, that I don't have to come

748
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,520
 and get cleaned up and fixed up and look prettier

749
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,960
 and look more spiritual to come to you.

750
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,640
 I can come in my brokenness.

751
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,320
 We can come in our brokenness and fall before you

752
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,960
 and find life in you.

753
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,520
 Jesus, will you help search our hearts,

754
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,000
 know our anxious thoughts,

755
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,520
 see if there is any grievous way in me

756
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,200
 and lead us in the way everlasting.

757
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,080
 Expose our junk, Lord, and give us courage

758
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,200
 to bring it into the light so that we can be free.

759
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,700
 in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
